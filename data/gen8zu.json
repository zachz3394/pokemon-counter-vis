Special walls like Miltank, Clefairy, and Articuno can switch into special wallbreakers like Jynx and Rotom that Poliwrath is also vulnerable to, as well as providing additional utility—the former two can provide Stealth Rock and cleric support, which works well with Circle Throw, while the latter can clear entry hazards and pivot.

Such sets can run Destiny Bond to get an unexpected KO, but Qwilfish usually doesn't have the room for it and is required to run an inferior max Speed spread.

Memento is an alternative for the defensive pivot set, blocking Defog and bringing in a teammate more safely than U-turn, but Uxie often can't fit it.

Attackers such as Thievul, Gourgeist-Small, and Shiftry can weaken Dark-types, especially with entry hazard support from setters such as Qwilfish, Piloswine, and Stunfisk. Toxic Spikes Qwilfish put Dark-types on a timer, although Skuntank is immune to them and some Dark-types like Morpeko run Heavy-Duty Boots. Fighting-types such as Gurdurr, Poliwrath, and Sawk check Dark- and Steel-types for Alcremie. Leftovers variants of Alcremie value having a sturdy defensive core to counteract its passivity and benefits from partners like Tangela and Altaria. Offensive Steel-types, mainly Alolan Dugtrio and Klinklang, need to be removed before Alcremie can sweep; therefore, teammates such as Rapidash and Sawk are appreciated.</p> "

Heavy-Duty Boots makes it easier for Alcremie to utilize its great defensive typing and switch in against foes like Thievul, Sawk, and Gurdurr, while Life Orb makes Alcremie a better wallbreaker.</p> <p>Dark-types such as Shiftry, Silvally-Dark, and Morpeko enjoy Alcremie's ability to take on Fighting- and Dark-types such as Gurdurr and Alolan Persian. Physical wallbreakers such as Thwackey and Choice Band Sawk can force in physical walls and pivot, providing Alcremie with wallbreaking opportunities, while also threatening special walls such as Clefairy, which can handle Alcremie. Ground-types such as Rhydon, Stunfisk, and Piloswine check Fire- and Poison-types such as Rapidash and Silvally-Poison. Partners such as Qwilfish, Rapidash, and Appletun can also wall problematic Fire-types for Alcremie.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Taunt prevents Pokemon such as Uxie and Miltank from setting entry hazards and foes such as Altaria and Rotom-S from recovering health or using Defog. Life Orb grants Morpeko the freedom to switch between its moves, but the recoil can bring it in range of priority moves such as Basculin's Aqua Jet. Also, the decrease in damage output compared to Choice Band leaves Morpeko unable to reliably 2HKO Pokemon such as Altaria.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Bulky Ground-types such as Piloswine, Rhydon, and Stunfisk are able to take most of Morpeko's attacks and force it out. However, they need to be healthy enough to tank a hit from Aura Wheel in Hangry Mode.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Defensive Grass-types such as Tangela and Appletun are able to take a hit from Morpeko and either cripple it with status or force it out.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls: While they are unable to switch into Choice Band Aura Wheel, Morpeko struggles to break through physical walls such as Miltank and Altaria. Other physically bulky Pokemon such physically defensive Alcremie and Gurdurr are able to withstand an attack and OHKO Morpeko.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Morpeko is susceptible to revenge killers, especially priority users, due to its poor bulk. Priority users such as Kangaskan, Gurdurr, and Basculin are to pick it off after it is weakened, while certain Choice Scarf users such as Sawk and Silvally are able to revenge kill Morpeko if it lacks a Speed boost.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Choice Band Morpeko is a unique offensive threat thanks to its signature move Aura Wheel and typing giving it a resistance to common revenge killers like Choice Scarf Rotom and Sucker Punch Shiftry. Aura Wheel gives Morpeko +1 Speed after each use, allowing it to outpace offensive threats like Rapidash and Choice Scarf Sawk to clean weakened teams late-game. Crunch provides Morpeko with a reliable Dark-type STAB move, hitting foes such as Gourgeist formes and Rotom. Seed Bomb is Morpeko's best coverage against opposing Ground-types, granting it a 2HKO against Piloswine and Rhydon after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Ground-types are able to play around Aura Wheel and must be eliminated before Morpeko can effectively clean. Water-types such Poliwrath, Qwilfish, and Cramorant pair well with Morpeko, as they weaken Ground-types and benefit from Morpeko's ability to pressure Pokemon like Rotom and Articuno. Special attackers like Jynx and Choice Specs Basculin are also able to handle the aforementioned Ground-types and eliminate physically defensive walls such as Acid Armor Alcremie and Tangela. These special attackers also appreciate Morpeko weakening bulky Water-types such as Poliwrath and Pyukumuku.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Morpeko holds a niche as a Rapid Spin user on offensive teams, handling some common entry hazard setters such as Uxie and Qwilfish. It also threatens Ghost-types such as Rotom, and Gourgeist formes, which other Rapid Spin users such as Coalossal and Kabutops do not do as effectively. However, Morpeko has a poor matchup against other entry hazard setters, especially Ground-types such as Piloswine, Rhydon, and Stunfisk, which limit its effectiveness. Aura Wheel serves as Morpeko's strongest STAB move, hitting foes like Qwilfish, Cramorant, and Articuno in Full Belly Mode and Uxie and Rotom in Hangry Mode. Protect allows Morpeko to safely switch between its Full Belly and Hangry formes while also allowing it to scout moves from Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Sawk. Parting Shot pairs well with the Speed boost provided by Aura Wheel and allows Morpeko to pivot from unfavorable matchups.</p> <p>Morpeko works best on offensive entry hazard stacking teams that appreciate its Rapid Spin and pivot support. Entry hazard setters such as Qwilfish, Coalossal, and Rhydon synergize well with Morpeko, the former checking Fighting-types such as Sawk and Fairy-types such as Clefairy; in return, Morpeko is able to handle foes like Rotom and Cramorant. Piloswine is able to wear down opposing Ground-types like Rhydon and set Stealth Rock. Wallbreakers like Jynx and Flapple appreciate Morpeko luring walls like Tangela and Altaria and bringing them in with Parting Shot. Attackers such as Kangaskan and setup sweepers such as Silvally-Poison enjoy Morpeko's Rapid Spin support.</p> "
