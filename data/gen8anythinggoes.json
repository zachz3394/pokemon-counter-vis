    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Chansey can run a wide array of moves due to its large support movepool. Chansey's phenomenal HP makes Wish in the first or third moveslot very effective. However, forgoing Aromatherapy sacrifices its role as a cleric, and not using Toxic or Seismic Toss leaves Chansey with absolutely no way to damage foes. Stealth Rock can also be used, as it can allow teammates like Necrozma-DM to run otherwise unfeasible sets like defensive Dragon Dance. If Chansey’s teammates can reliably keep Xerneas at bay, Teleport can be used over Confide; this allows it to pivot, putting the user in an advantageous position against switch-ins. However, it is usually not worth it because Chansey all but loses its niche as a strong Xerneas check, as it can't stop Geomancy from eventually overpowering it. Thunder Wave is a fringe option over Toxic, as it affects Chansey’s most prominent switch-ins in Necrozma-DM and Eternatus, but forgoing Toxic prevents Chansey from making any meaningful progress. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD can be used on non-Stealth Rock variants; this allows Chansey to switch into Choice Specs Kyogre if it is healthy. However, this forces Chansey to switch out of any physical or mixed attacker, making it much more difficult to use Aromatherapy or heal.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physical Damage: Chansey should avoid Pokemon that can target its pitiful physical bulk. This includes a few special and mixed attackers, such as Psyshock Calyrex-S and offensive Yveltal if Dynamax. However, in an emergency scenario Chansey may stay in against an unboosted Psyshock user.</p> <p><strong>Poison- and Steel-types: Poison- and Steel-types such as Eternatus, Necrozma-DM, and Zacian-C aren’t affected by Toxic; Eternatus can annoy Chansey with Pressure, Necrozma-DM can remove its Eviolite with Knock Off, and Zacian-C can OHKO with Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Gothitelle: Gothitelle can trap and remove even Seismic Toss Chansey with its faster Taunt and Rest. While occasional Teleport sets can lure Gothitelle out, Chansey can’t safely stay in as Gothitelle can beat it with rare Trick sets. However, Chansey has an easier time against Gothitelle if it has both Seismic Toss and Teleport.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off</strong>: Eviolite is instrumental to Chansey’s walling, and losing it may make Chansey unable to handle some stronger special attackers, such as Geomancy Xerneas and Kyogre. Some Necrozma-DM and Yveltal use Knock Off; it’s important to scout for the move before keeping Chansey in against these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: As Chansey is extremely passive, Taunt will force it to switch, use Seismic Toss if it has it, or use Struggle. Chansey with Seismic Toss will also often switch, as common Taunt users usually either don’t care about the chip from Seismic Toss, can easily heal from it, or are immune to the move.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Although Chansey has reliable healing, stall teams that fail to keep entry hazards away can leave it whittled down, forcing it to heal much more often and therefore preventing it from coming in as much. Some hazard setters to watch out for are Necrozma-DM, Groudon, and Ferrothorn, with the last one being especially annoying due to it recovering a significant portion of its HP against Chansey with Leech Seed.</p> ",

Aromatherapy allows Chansey to act as a cleric, and its bulk gives it many chances to use this move in longer games. Toxic or Seismic Toss is used to inflict damage; Toxic cripples Yveltal and annoys Kyogre lacking Rest, while Seismic Toss can chip Zacian-C switch-ins, break Geomancy Xerneas’s Substitute, and let Chansey stay in against Taunt Yveltal. Confide is used to check Calm Mind Kyogre and Xerneas. Investment in Special Defense helps Chansey stomach hits from Xerneas and Kyogre, and Defense investment is imperative for Aromatherapy, giving Chansey far more chances to use it on weaker physical Pokemon like Ho-Oh and Zygarde-C.</p> <p>Chansey is best used on stall and bulky balance teams, as it is extremely passive but can reliably counter opposing Xerneas, offensive Eternatus, and non-Choice Specs Kyogre. Having solid defensive partners helps to scout opposing Pokemon’s movesets, especially for Knock Off, allowing it to come in more safely. In stall teams, Chansey should be paired with physically bulky Pokemon, such as Quagsire and Giratina; Quagsire greatly appreciates Aromatherapy and can switch into most physical setup sweepers, as well as Zacian-C, and Giratina is especially useful as a partner due to Pressure stifling entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn. On balance teams, Necrozma-DM is an excellent partner due to being an easy to fit check to most physical attackers; Chansey, in return, checks most special attackers. Rest users, such as Zygarde-C and bulky Kyogre, greatly benefit from Aromatherapy. As Chansey switches often, it gets chipped by hazards, which, with time, can hinder its ability to aid its teammates and heal; Defoggers such as Ho-Oh and Giratina are greatly appreciated.</p> "

Freeze-Dry is used to directly damage foes such as Kyogre, Yveltal, Zygarde, and Eternatus.

Alternatively, Toxic wears down Kyogre, Kyurem-W, and other special attackers much more reliably.

Unless it has Substitute, Zacian-C is especially vulnerable to Ditto, as a +2 Ditto can break through Zacian-C's common check in Necrozma-DM with Close Combat. Similarly, Calyrex-S fears Ditto, as it punishes Calyrex-S heavily for coming in by threatening a reverse sweep in conjunction with As One. Ditto is an amazing user of Dynamax; after copying a boosted sweeper like Calyrex-S, Groudon, or Xerneas, it can Dynamax to break the Choice lock, usually allowing it to break through a check that switches into Ditto. However, this is only recommended when Dynamax is necessary to KO a foe, when checks are weakened enough to wrap up the game, or if Ditto needs to survive a predicted priority move. It is possible for Ditto to face an opposing Ditto one-on-one, and the EVs and IVs have been chosen with this in mind. 248 HP EVs ensure that Ditto will be able to use Struggle four times before fainting, and 252 Defense EVs minimize Struggle damage from an opposing Ditto. The minimum possible Speed allows Imposter to not activate first and therefore allow Ditto to have more Transform PP.</p> <p>Ditto works best on balance and stall teams that appreciate its ability to deter opposing setup attempts. Necrozma-DM and Tyranitar work well with Ditto, as they can weaken a boosted Xerneas and Life Orb Yveltal respectively before Ditto comes in and revenge kills. Xerneas and Yveltal have noticeably higher bulk than a Ditto transformed into either, so it is important for the aforementioned two checks to pressure them to Dynamax, removing their ability to reliably win against a Ditto that can Dynamax one-on-one. Moreover, Tyranitar also doubles as a mandatory check to Calyrex-S. Checks to the ever-dangerous Dragon Dance Zygarde-C, such as Lunala, and Calm Mind Kyogre, such as Blissey, Eternatus, and Ferrothorn, are essential, as Ditto is incapable of revenge killing them. Gothitelle is a rather niche option that helps to deal with passive Pokemon lacking Shed Shell, particularly non-Teleport Blissey and Eternatus. Ditto enjoys being at full or near full HP so it can survive potential priority moves and take on a healthy Xerneas, so Defoggers such as Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Giratina are invaluable teammates for it.</p> "

Dragon Dance Zygarde-C particularly enjoys setting up on Blissey, as its Substitute is not broken by Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards: Blissey is vulnerable to entry hazard damage over the course of the game, and if it is forced out before it can use Soft-Boiled, its HP can get too low to safely switch into Choice Specs Kyogre or boosted Xerneas.</p> <p><strong>Trick Users: If a Pokemon like Calyrex-S gives a Choice item to Blissey, it will typically become almost useless for the remainder of the battle. It cannot make full use of its moveset to check Pokemon and can be used as setup fodder by a considerable portion of the meta if locked into Soft-Boiled.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users</strong>: Taunt limits Blissey to only its Seismic Toss, meaning it is not able to effectively perform its role of a special wall. As such, Blissey can struggle greatly against Yveltal and Gothitelle.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Blissey is a good special wall in AG, most notably acting as a counter to offensive Kyogre thanks to its huge special bulk, reliable recovery, and Utility Umbrella. In addition, it can wall many of the other prevalent special attackers in the metagame such as Eternatus and Xerneas and is especially great at wasting their Dynamax turns. Toxic can be used to cripple threats like Yveltal and Dragon Dance Zygarde, whereas Seismic Toss gives Blissey more immediate offensive presence and breaks Xerneas's Substitute. Aromatherapy can be used to keep statused teammates useful for the duration of the match, notably benefitting offensive teammates like Calyrex-S and Zacian-C. Teleport turns Blissey into a defensive pivot, as it often baits in Pokemon like Zacian-C, allowing it to safely switch to counterplay. Confide halts special setup sweepers like Geomancy Xerneas and Calm Mind Kyogre. The EV spread is used to maximize Blissey's overall bulk.</p> <p>Owing to its extreme passivity, Blissey is typically more suited for balanced teams looking to check special threats. Physically defensive Ho-Oh forms a strong defensive backbone with Blissey, as it is able to check some of Ho-Oh's threats in Kyogre and Xerneas, and Ho-Oh can check Steel-types such as Zacian-C, Ferrothorn, and defensive Necrozma-DM. Necrozma-DM itself is also an excellent Pokemon to pair with Blissey for its high Defense and Prism Armor allowing it to take on Zacian-C. Pokemon that are revenge killed by Choice Scarf Kyogre, specifically Zacian-C and Groudon, will appreciate Blissey's ability to switch in and immediately force it out; with Teleport, Blissey can maintain momentum. Blissey also pairs well with Pokemon that struggle against Eternatus such as Zygarde-C, Kyogre, and Yveltal, as it can sponge its attacks and Toxic with Natural Cure while potentially burning through Recover PP with Seismic Toss. Blissey struggles against the likes of Marshadow and Zygarde-C, so a strong Fairy-type partner in Xerneas or Zacian-C is quite useful.</p> "

Not having a Dark-type STAB move or Thunder Wave does, however, let Zacian-C, Choice Scarf Kyogre, and other wallbreakers switch in far more freely. Crunch can also be used over Foul Play to pressure Eternatus with more damage and potential Defense drops, but it doesn't have the same utility as many other options Tyranitar has access to.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Super Effective STAB Attacks: Tyranitar's typing leaves it with multiple weaknesses, so STAB attacks from multiple common Pokemon such as Marshadow, Necrozma-DM, and Xerneas can easily break through its bulk, and they don't take much damage from Tyranitar's attacks back.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Groudon and Zygarde's high natural Defense, Rock resistance, and immunity to Thunder Wave make them stone walls for Tyranitar. Groudon can switch in multiple times and use it to set up Stealth Rock or a more dangerous Swords Dance, and Zygarde-C can likewise freely set up with Dragon Dance or Coil, although Foul Play deters Swords Dance and Dragon Dance.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: All the major Water-types in the metagame can threaten Tyranitar, as none of them are largely bothered by the attacks it can throw out. Kyogre changes the weather and threatens an OHKO with its offensive sets, and defensive sets can set up on it with Calm Mind and use Rest to negate Thunder Wave, the only potentially troubling attack to Kyogre. Palkia and Dracovish hit it for massive damage if not an OHKO, and Tyranitar has no meaningful way to threaten Gastrodon or Quagsire. Offensive Kyogre, Palkia, and Dracovish must, however, switch in safely due to Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Zacian-C: Zacian-C has multiple ways to OHKO Tyranitar, and it easily takes advantage of the turns spent clicking Rest or Stealth Rock by forcing Tyranitar out and potentially getting setup turns. It doesn't appreciate being worn down by Foul Play or being paralyzed by Thunder Wave, however, limiting its switch-in opportunities.</p> ",

Rock Blast is chosen over other Rock-type STAB moves to beat SubSeed Calyrex-S while still forcing Yveltal out. Foul Play deters some physical attackers such as Zacian-C, Marshadow, and Groudon from switching in or setting up on Tyranitar. Thunder Wave is similarly useful, but it trades the ability to deter Zygarde or Groudon from setting up for the ability to cripple Kyogre and Xerneas. Tyranitar lacks reliable recovery, so it has to use Rest to heal from the continuous attacks it will likely be taking, but this does let it absorb status from the likes of Toxic Ho-Oh, Toxic Eternatus, and Giratina. Leftovers makes Tyranitar need to use Rest less often, but Heavy-Duty Boots is another solid option to increase its longevity. Maximum Special Defense and HP investment gives it the best chances of beating Calyrex-S over a longer game, which is generally its most important role, and is overall helpful for most special attackers that can't immediately threaten it such as Eternatus and specially offensive Yveltal.</p> <p>Tyranitar's best fit is on balance teams that appreciate its ability to check Calyrex-S, Yveltal, and Eternatus while also providing Stealth Rock support. This Stealth Rock support also gives teammates the moveset freedom to exert more pressure, like Necrozma-DM running more offensive Dragon Dance sets. Tyranitar can be overwhelmed by a number of offensive Pokemon in the metagame such as Zacian-C, Kyogre, Xerneas, and Groudon. Teammates that can deal with these threats such as Necrozma-DM, Eternatus, Ferrothorn, and Lunala, respectively, are all useful. Eternatus can additionally outspeed threats like Marshadow and Zygarde-C and deal with them with Dynamax Cannon while limiting opposing Necrozma-DM due to its good bulk and Pressure. Ferrothorn also switches into Kyogre reliably. Zacian-C can pressure Xerneas and revenge kill offensive Pokemon like weakened Groudon. It also appreciates sand weakening Necrozma-DM's recovery and Stealth Rock powering up Assurance, which makes Necrozma-DM lacking Heavy-Duty Boots struggles to switch into Zacian-C. Quagsire is a more reliable of way of dealing with Zacian-C than Necrozma-DM when paired with Tyranitar, as its recovery is not hindered by sand, but it can only find a place on bulky balance and stall teams. Offensive Excadrill requires Tyranitar as a teammate to work reliably, although Tyranitar does not require it.</p> "

Ho-Oh can switch into a plethora of common threats, including Yveltal, Zacian-C, and Eternatus, allowing for movepool scouting and wasting Dynamax turns from threats such as Yveltal and Zygarde-C. Sacred Fire is Ho-Oh's primary means of damage output, notably allowing it to deal heavy damage to opposing Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C while threatening to burn potential switch-ins such as Eternatus and Zekrom, which could otherwise take advantage of it. Great care must be taken, however, to ensure that one's Sacred Fire PP does not get wasted over the course of a battle, especially if the opponent has a Pressure user such as Eternatus, Palkia, or Giratina. Toxic allows Ho-Oh to reliably cripple a significant portion of the metagame, notably putting Yveltal, Palkia lacking Rest, Calyrex-S, and numerous other threats on timers, while also helping to deter potential switch-ins, particularly preventing Kyogre from switching in freely on Ho-Oh. Defog lets Ho-Oh provide invaluable utility to its team, helping to keep the field clear of Spikes and Stealth Rock. It also notably protects Necrozma-DM from Assurance Zacian-C, which is particularly beneficial, as Ho-Oh has a good matchup versus common entry hazard users such as Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn. Whirlwind is chosen to enable Ho-Oh to deter Pokemon like Xerneas and Dragon Dance Zygarde-C from setting up while also enabling it to be a last-ditch defense against potential runaway sweepers like +1 Calyrex-S. Alternatively, Protect can be used to allow Ho-Oh to more reliably check Yveltal, waste multiple turns of Yveltal's or Xerneas's Dynamax, and scout what move Choice-item users lock into. Brave Bird can also be used to let Ho-Oh chip Eternatus and to potentially boost its Speed under Dynamax. Regenerator gives Ho-Oh a source of reliable recovery throughout the match, allowing it to pivot into attacks from a wide variety of potentially threatening attackers with ease. The given EVs with an Impish nature allow Ho-Oh to survive a +2 Thunder from Geomancy Xerneas from full health while also maximizing physical bulk and minimizing Stealth Rock damage if Heavy-Duty Boots is Knocked Off.</p> <p>Ho-Oh can fit on all manner of balance, bulky offense, and stall teams thanks to its ability to pivot into a significant portion of the metagame's attackers, enabling teammates safer switches.

An especially good teammate for Ho-Oh is the nigh mandatory Necrozma-DM, which greatly appreciates the presence of a secondary Xerneas and Zacian-C check. Ho-Oh should be used with caution around opposing Knock Off Ferrothorn and Necrozma-DM, since the loss of Heavy-Duty Boots severely reduces Ho-Oh's survivability. Additionally, teammates such as Ferrothorn, Blissey, and Eternatus can all pair well with Ho-Oh, since they reliably check Kyogre, which would otherwise threaten Ho-Oh. Notably, Ferrothorn and Eternatus can provide hazard support, which pairs well with Ho-Oh's ability to force switches through Whirlwind. Ho-Oh should not be a team's only check to Yveltal, so teammates such as specially defensive Eternatus and Tyranitar can be useful to have.</p> "

Sheer Cold is another option in the third slot, giving Kyogre a chance of breaking through Ferrothorn and Blissey much more easily while enabling it to wield an Ice-type Max Move. Roar enables Kyogre to take advantage of any entry hazards that may be on the opponent's field while foiling any opposing Calm Mind Kyogre and Geomancy Xerneas that may try set up adjacently. Block lets Kyogre lure in and trap Eternatus, allowing Kyogre to use it as setup bait. A Modest nature can be used on Choice Specs Kyogre to have a better chance of KOing foes, notably offensive Eternatus and Kyurem-W after some chip damage, but is generally worse than Timid because it keeps Kyogre from outspeeding foes like unboosted Xerneas and Rash or Modest Yveltal. Even on Sticky Web teams, Timid Kyogre can always outspeed Jolly Zacian-C and non-Choice Scarf Calyrex-S. Sheer Cold is an option to pressure switch-ins such as Eternatus and Palkia, but it is generally not worthwhile due to its very low accuracy and it being hard to justify forgoing a coverage move for. Surf and Scald can be used on Choice Scarf Kyogre as more accurate alternatives to Origin Pulse. Scald can be useful for burning Pokemon like Zacian-C and Ferrothorn in a pinch, which can be threatening to Kyogre without Water Spout. However, Surf and Scald lack in power, more often failing to deal enough damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ferrothorn: Ferrothorn carrying a Grass-type attack uses Kyogre as an opportunity to set up Spikes while completely walling it unless Ferrothorn has been burned and Kyogre has a Substitute set up.

Kyurem-W lacking Dragon Tail can still damage Kyogre heavily with Freeze-Dry or even threaten to OHKO Kyogre after accumulating multiple Calm Mind boosts with Sheer Cold.</p> <p><strong>Blissey</strong>: Blissey's monstrous special bulk paired with a Utility Umbrella allows it to threaten Kyogre. It can wear Kyogre down with Seismic Toss, cripple it with Toxic, weaken it with Confide, or slow pivot out to a teammate with Teleport.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Despite Kyogre's high bulk, revenge killers such as Calyrex-S, Marshadow, Sucker Punch Yveltal, and Zacian-C can all outspeed Kyogre due to its average Speed stat. However, Sticky Web support from Shuckle allows Choice Specs Kyogre to outspeed most of these threats. Ditto can also revenge kill Choice Specs or Choice Scarf Kyogre by using Thunder, but Kyogre's teammates are able to take advantage of Ditto being locked into a single non-STAB move, especially if Ditto's team has already used its Dynamax. Kyogre can also circumvent the aforementioned revenge killers easily through Dynamax's HP boost. Offensive lead variants are able to OHKO Kyogre, while utility ones can also set dual screens to make Kyogre's revenge killing more difficult.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Dragon-types: Bulky Dragon-types such as Eternatus, Palkia, and Kyurem-W can reliably check Kyogre due to their bulk and useful typing against it.

Scald is preferred as the main attack due to its higher PP and accuracy, and it notably can punish Ferrothorn and Eternatus with a burn. However, Origin Pulse has much higher initial power—OHKOing defensive Necrozma-DM and Ho-Oh after a single Calm Mind, helping Kyogre to avoid status. Ice Beam enables Kyogre to cleanly KO Eternatus once set up while also allowing it to serve as a reliable Zygarde-C check. Otherwise, Substitute can be chosen in order to set up on Ferrothorn lacking a Grass-type attack, avoid being phazed by Dragon Tail Eternatus and Kyurem-W, negate status, stall out Sheer Cold from Kyurem-W lacking Freeze-Dry and opposing Kyogre, and be less easily revenge killed by Zacian-C and Zekrom. If using Substitute, Scald is more strongly preferred over Origin Pulse as, after a burn and factoring in miss chances, Ferrothorn's Power Whip only has a 53% chance of breaking Kyogre's Substitute, while Bullet Seed variants fail to do so. Rest enables Kyogre to easily recover from status, making it unable to be harmed easily by common defensive Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, and Eternatus, while Leftovers reduces its reliance on Rest. The given EV spread maximizes physical bulk, helping shrug off hits from Groudon and Zygarde-C, while enabling Kyogre to outspeed paralyzed Calyrex-S. Under Dynamax, Kyogre becomes incredibly hard to revenge kill, as its bulk reaches colossal levels—easily withstanding a Max Lightning from Zekrom.</p> <p>Calm Mind Kyogre fits on a variety of balance teams, as it absorbs status and checks Zygarde-C, and it threatens to easily sweep teams without Dragon Tail Eternatus, Blissey, Kyurem-W, or Ferrothorn. As such, teammates that are able to punish these foes, such as Zacian-C and Groudon, are appreciated. In return, Kyogre summons rain, weakening Necrozma-DM's recovery so Zacian-C can break through it far more easily, while easily punishing Zygarde-C for Groudon. Dracovish is another powerful teammate, easily capable of overwhelming shared checks, especially if Kyogre runs Thunder Wave in the third moveslot. Additionally, Ferrothorn and Yveltal can use Knock Off to cripple Eternatus and opposing Ferrothorn, making opposing Ferrothorn far easier for Kyogre to defeat when coupled with Scald burns. Yveltal can also switch into Calyrex-S in order to absorb Trick. Gothitelle is a valuable partner, capable of trapping and removing Ferrothorn, Blissey, and non-Dragon Tail Eternatus. Thunder Wave Ho-Oh lures in and cripples Eternatus while preventing opposing Ferrothorn from placing entry hazards. While Kyogre isn't easily revenge killed, once Dynamax has ended, it can be severely damaged by opposing Zekrom and Zacian-C, and so counterplay such as Groudon, Lunala, and Necrozma-DM or revenge killers such as Calyrex-S and Ditto are appreciated.

Teammates that can deal with Water-resistant Pokemon like Eternatus, Palkia, Ferrothorn, and Giratina, such as Zacian-C, Xerneas, and Eternatus, are appreciated. Zacian-C and Xerneas benefit from Kyogre's rain, as it weakens Necrozma-DM's Morning Sun, making it a less effective check against the two. Pokemon like Life Orb Yveltal, Calyrex-S, and Groudon appreciate Kyogre pressuring their checks like Tyranitar, Yveltal, and Zygarde-C, respectively. In return, they are able to defeat the aforementioned checks to Kyogre. On bulky offense teams without Sticky Web, Kyogre's teammates must be able to check fast threats. For example, Yveltal can check Calyrex-S, and Necrozma-DM can check Zacian-C.

With its good Attack stat and solid movepool, Groudon can find many opportunities to force out foes such as Necrozma-DM, Tyranitar, Zekrom, and Ho-Oh and set up for a potential sweep. Swords Dance turns Groudon into a deadly wallbreaker, allowing it to 2HKO Zygarde-C and Giratina as well as and OHKO Lunala and Zygarde after minor chip damage. Stone Edge allows Groudon to hit Flying-types such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal that would otherwise be a nuisance for it. Under Dynamax, Stone Edge turns into Max Rockfall, setting sand that breaks Lunala's Shadow Shield. Aerial Ace turns into Max Airstream, allowing Groudon to outspeed almost the entire metagame after a Speed boost. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature allows Groudon to outpace Calyrex-S after Max Airstream has been used, while Life Orb guarantees several key OHKOs and 2HKOes after a Swords Dance boost.</p> <p>Groudon's best fit is on hyper offense teams, although it can also fit well on balance and bulky offense teams. On hyper offense, teammates such as Shuckle and Excadrill are able to provide immense support for it through entry hazards such as Sticky Web and Stealth Rock, respectively, enabling it to better break through its extremely limited checks. Groudon can force out common entry hazard setters such as Necrozma-DM, Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn, which is valuable because Shuckle cannot remove opposing entry hazards and Excadrill's Rapid Spin can be blocked by Ghost-types such as Marshadow and Calyrex-S. Zacian-C in particular is a good wallbreaker that can lure in Necrozma-DM and weaken Zygarde-C, and Yveltal can pressure Ghost-types like Lunala, Calyrex-S, and Giratina for Groudon and Excadrill. Teammates like Ho-Oh and Necrozma-DM can Imposter-proof Groudon, stalling out Ditto's Dynamax turns to somewhat reliably check it. Ferrothorn can check Choice Scarf Kyogre and provide Spikes support for Groudon on bulky offense teams. Other setup sweepers such as Xerneas, Nasty Plot Calyrex-S, and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM appreciate Groudon KOing walls such as Necrozma-DM, Tyranitar, and Ferrothorn for them. In return, they can pressure walls such as Zygarde-C and full health Lunala that Groudon struggles with. To maximize Groudon's sweeping potential, the foe's Dynamax should be wasted by powerful teammates such as Xerneas, Zacian-C, and Kyogre.

Dragon Dance can be used instead to be consistently faster without using Max Airstream, especially if another teammate has already used Dynamax. Dragon Ascent turns into Max Airstream during Dynamax, making Rayquaza difficult to revenge kill by raising its Speed by one stage each turn, tearing apart offensive teams.

Extreme Speed is useful for revenge killing weakened threats such as boosted Xerneas, Sucker Punch Yveltal, and opposing Rayquaza.

Ghost-types like Marshadow and Calyrex-S are immune to Extreme Speed, which helps against non-Dynamaxed Ditto if it has copied Rayquaza. Rayquaza should usually be used mid- to late-game once all of its checks are removed. It's also recommended to waste the opponent's Dynamax with dangerous wallbreakers like Zacian-C and Calyrex-S before attempting to sweep, since it becomes much harder for foes to take hits from Rayquaza.</p> "

Thunder is used to nail Kyogre, which Palkia is able to check thanks to its useful typing and natural bulk. It also does hefty damage to Yveltal. Hydro Pump offers more power than Spacial Rend and can hit neutral targets such as Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C hard and Ho-Oh and Groudon super effectively.

Quagsire is an excellent check to Zacian-C and Zygarde-C, as it can use Haze to get rid of boosts and tank boosted attacks because of Unaware. However, using Quagsire means forgoing Necrozma-DM, and thus forgoing a key component of checking Xerneas. If using Quagsire, Chansey is a nigh mandatory teammate to patch this up.

Charm weakens physical attackers, and Cosmic Power bolsters it against special attackers while also giving insurance against physical attackers. Taunt helps Gothitelle PP stall, forcing the foe to eventually use Struggle. Rest is Gothitelle’s best form of longevity and removes status conditions; it also helps it to PP stall by not using up PP on Rest turns. The given EV spread allows Gothitelle to outspeed defensive Necrozma-DM while maximizing physical bulk. Alternatively, a spread of 244 HP / 60 Def / 204 Spe with a Bold nature sees use to more effectively trap defensive Ho-Oh, Zygarde-C, and Groudon. Special Defense investment is also an option to trap bulky Eternatus more easily at the cost of reducing its ability to trap Necrozma-DM and Ho-Oh. Substitute can be used over either Charm or Cosmic Power to block Dragon Tail from Pokemon like Eternatus and Zygarde-C and Leech Seed from Ferrothorn, but this sacrifices either its dependability against Necrozma-DM and Ho-Oh or the ability to trap defensive Eternatus that carries Dynamax Cannon.</p> <p>Gothitelle fits best on balance and occasionally stall teams, and teammates that appreciate it removing their defensive answers do great with it. Zacian-C in particular is an excellent partner, since most teams rely on Necrozma-DM or Quagsire to beat it, which Gothitelle can trap. Kyogre struggles with Eternatus and appreciates Gothitelle's ability to trap and remove it, along with Blissey. Chansey, and Ferrothorn. Stall teams appreciate it removing Ferrothorn, since Ferrothorn can beat most common Defoggers one-on-one, as well as certain Pressure and Regenerator users like Eternatus and Ho-Oh that can often PP stall them. Gothitelle is offensively threatened by a lot and provides little to no defensive utility against hyper offense teams, so it requires a revenge killer and a proper defensive backbone. Zacian-C is a massive threat to Gothitelle; counters to it such as Necrozma-DM and Quagsire are especially appreciated. Calyrex-S is another massive threat to Gothitelle, so defensive answers to it such as Yveltal and Tyranitar are needed. Good checks to other threats such as Marshadow, Yveltal, and Xerneas are Zacian-C, specially defensive Eternatus, Necrozma-DM, Choice Scarf Calyrex-S, Ditto, and Zacian, which are also effective at stopping many offensive threats like Groudon, Reshiram, and Zekrom from sweeping.</p> "

However, dropping Protect, Knock Off, or Toxic can make Ferrothorn less reliable as a check to Xerneas or even more passive, respectively. Gyro Ball is another option in the last slot that has no accuracy drawback, allowing Ferrothorn to deal with Xerneas more reliably; it serves little to no use outside of that, however. Bullet Seed can be used over Power Whip to prevent Ferrothorn from being trapped by Gothitelle due to the move's high PP, although it's generally inferior to Power Whip due to the unreliability of it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ho-Oh: Ho-Oh can consistently switch into Ferrothorn due to Regenerator, force it out with the threat of a powerful Sacred Fire, and remove its Spikes with Defog. However, Ho-Oh fears losing its Heavy-Duty Boots to a Knock Off, since it will become much easier to wear down if Stealth Rock is on the opponent's side of the field. Ho-Oh doesn't appreciate Toxic either; being badly poisoned takes away from its ability to come out on top against Stealth Rock Necrozma-DM.</p> <p><strong>Eternatus: A well-played Eternatus is the second largest obstacle for Ferrothorn. Not only does Eternatus force Ferrothorn out with Flamethrower or Mystical Fire, it's also capable of gradually PP stalling Ferrothorn out of Spikes and Leech Seed in more drawn-out games, not being bothered by anything Ferrothorn can dish out other than Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Calyrex-S</strong>: Calyrex-S takes advantage of Body Press Ferrothorn’s inability to damage Ghost-type Pokemon and will often set up a Nasty Plot. However, Calyrex-S fears the possibility of Ferrothorn having Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Foes like Zacian-C, Palkia, and Marshadow easily force Ferrothorn out, as they often carry super effective coverage to break Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers: Ferrothorn's bulk is nothing to brag about in the context of the metagame. As a result, generally strong wallbreakers such as Calyrex-S and Groudon are more than capable of heavily damaging Ferrothorn or forcing it out.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Users: Ferrothorn's passivity makes it setup fodder against foes under a Substitute such as Zekrom, Reshiram, and Zygarde-C.</p> <p><strong>Phazers: Body Press Ferrothorn relies on Iron Defense to fortify its defenses in the face of physical attackers that boost their attack Zygarde-C with Dragon Tail is problematic for Ferrothorn as Ferrothorn loses its defense boosts when dragged out by Dragon Tail, rendering it unable to check Zygarde-C.</p> <p><strong>Gothitelle</strong>: Ferrothorn is unable to switch out against Gothitelle due to Shadow Tag, making it entirely susceptible to Taunt while being weakened by Charm. Gothitelle can also heal off Ferrothorn's weak attacks with Rest. However, Ferrothorn will still be able to greatly annoy Gothitelle in the process by removing Leftovers and chipping away at its health with Leech Seed. Moreover, Gothitelle is incapable of trapping Ferrothorn if the latter opts to run Bullet Seed.</p> ",

Its excellent typing also allows it to soft check Kyogre, which allows Eternatus to play more offensively. Iron Defense or Curse allows Ferrothorn to bolster its Defense to check physical setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Zekrom and Zygarde. Body Press is the preferred attack on Ferrothorn, as its power is based on Ferrothorn’s Defense; it also allows Ferrothorn to punish Yveltal for using Roost, helping Ferrothorn keep entry hazards up and weakening Yveltal to enable a Calyrex-S sweep. Knock Off and Curse are alternatives to Body Press and Iron Defense, respectively, that debilitate pivots heavily dependent on Heavy-Duty Boots such as Ho-Oh, cripple item-dependent breakers such as Marshadow, and threaten Calyrex-S. Knock Off also allows Ferrothorn to make immediate progress against opposing Eternatus and Ferrothorn by removing their Black Sludge and Leftovers. However, the extra stage of Defense that Iron Defense provides over Curse is often crucial for surviving matchups against certain powerful physical sweepers such as Life Orb Zygarde and Swords Dance Groudon. Leech Seed allows Ferrothorn to gain an incredible amount of passive recovery alongside Leftovers while chipping foes. Maximum Defense and HP investment with a Bold or Impish nature allows Ferrothorn to best handle the threats it checks.</p> <p>Physically defensive Ferrothorn works well on teams with wallbreakers that would benefit from Spikes support and beat its checks and counters; Zacian-C, Xerneas, Marshadow, and Kyogre are all great partners. Body Press Ferrothorn synergizes well with Calyrex-S, as it pressures specially defensive Yveltal with a super effective hit after using Roost. Knock Off users can also take advantage of Ferrothorn’s Spikes by knocking Heavy-Duty Boots off of enemy defensive pivots, making them prone to chip damage. Taunt Yveltal pairs effectively with Ferrothorn as it prevents enemy Defog and recovery, magnifying the impact of Spikes on entry hazard stack teams. Zekrom, Zygarde-C, and Kyogre all pressure Ho-Oh, one of Ferrothorn’s most notable checks. Another good partner for physically defensive Ferrothorn is Eternatus; Eternatus's convenient typing and bulk allow it to absorb super effective Fire- and Fighting-type attacks aimed at Ferrothorn, sponge Knock Off, which would otherwise deny Ferrothorn's Leftovers recovery, and drain Defog PP with Pressure, all while acting as a team's mandatory Kyogre check. Lastly, Ferrothorn appreciates Groudon, as it threatens Ho-Oh with Stone Edge and reliably sets Stealth Rock, which easily enables multiple layers of hazard stacking when used in conjunction with Ferrothorn's Spikes.</p> "

Leech Seed is Ferrothorn's most reliable form of recovery and a great tool of disruption against switch-ins such as Zacian-C. Power Whip deals immediate damage to Kyogre, notably forcing out bulky Calm Mind variants, and Xerneas. Protect is useful to scout for the foe's moves, gain Leftovers and Leech Seed recovery, and stall out Dynamax turns from the likes of Xerneas, Groudon, and Kyogre. Knock Off is an alternative to cripple foes like Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Eternatus. Toxic is another good option, crippling all of the metagame's Defoggers in Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Lunala. A specially defensive spread with a Careful nature is required in order for Ferrothorn to check Kyogre and Xerneas reliably. Ferrothorn should preserve its health with Leech Seed so it can stay healthy throughout the game while whittling down foes.</p> <p>Ferrothorn fits on all sorts of balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate having a check to Kyogre and Xerneas as well as Spikes support. Teammates like Zygarde-C, Zekrom, and Kyogre are notable for pressuring Ho-Oh, which is a huge threat to Ferrothorn. Ferrothorn significantly struggles against threats like Marshadow, Dragon Dance Zygarde-C and Zekrom, Groudon, Zacian-C, Eternatus, and Calyrex-S due to their super effective or powerful moves against it and their tendency to use Ferrothorn as setup bait. Therefore, good partners that can check these threats such as Zacian-C, Lunala, Necrozma-DM, Calyrex-S, and Yveltal are useful. Zygarde-C really appreciates Spikes support from Ferrothorn, as it synergizes fantastically with its Dragon Tail, while Ferrothorn is able to check Xerneas and disrupt Lunala for Zygarde-C. Groudon pairs excellently with Ferrothorn; Groudon is able to force out Ho-Oh and set up with Swords Dance while forcing it out, and it heavily benefits from Ferrothorn's Spikes chipping its checks and Ferrothorn's ability to check Kyogre. The likes of Zacian-C, Xerneas, Kyogre, and Marshadow are some other good teammates, benefitting hugely from Spikes wearing down their main checks in Necrozma-DM and Eternatus. Ferrothorn struggles to reliably check Choice Specs Kyogre, so a secondary Kyogre check like Eternatus is appreciated.</p> "

Dragon Dance can be used against Pokemon it forces out such as Ferrothorn, Blissey, and Necrozma-DM. Flare Blitz and Outrage offer nearly unresisted coverage, with Flare Blitz scaring out staples such as Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, and Zacian-C, and Outrage taking care of the likes of Zygarde-C, Eternatus, Kyogre, and Ho-Oh. Both moves heavily benefit from Dynamax removing their drawbacks, especially Outrage. On top of that, Max Flare summons sun, powering Reshiram up considerably, and Max Wyrmwind dropping the foe's Attack allows Reshiram to come out on top against Groudon. Roost offsets damage inflicted by entry hazards, Life Orb, and Flare Blitz recoil. Stone Edge may be run on faster-paced teams, allowing Reshiram to OHKO Ho-Oh without needing to lock itself into Outrage or Dynamax. A Jolly nature is preferred to outpace Zacian-C after one Dragon Dance.</p> <p>Reshiram fits well on hyper offense or bulky offense teams. Shuckle can provide Stealth Rock and Sticky Web, which lets Reshiram outpace Pokemon like Zacian-C, Calyrex-S, and Eternatus without a Dragon Dance, allowing it to force them out and potentially get setup turns. If not running Reshiram on hyper offense, it needs Defog support from Yveltal or Ho-Oh, as entry hazards will greatly hinder it from coming in repeatedly. Calyrex-S is great to heavily pressure Lunala, which can put Reshiram's sweep on a timer with Toxic. Xerneas is also a great partner, as it can take care of Pokemon that can be troublesome for unboosted Reshiram, like Palkia and Zekrom, and can serve as a check for Ditto, since Ditto copying Reshiram needs to either Dynamax and risk the Speed tie or become setup fodder for Xerneas by locking itself into Outrage. Xerneas also appreciates Reshiram's ability to pressure Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Zacian-C, and Necrozma-DM. Zacian-C is a good partner for Reshiram, as it can take care of faster Dragon-types such as Palkia and other faster attackers like Marshadow. It can also check Ditto like Xerneas can and take care of Ho-Oh If Reshiram is lacking Stone Edge. Marshadow is also great with Reshiram due to its Ghost-typing allowing it to threaten Lunala and Calyrex-S. Rayquaza can take care of Marshadow and Calyrex-S under Sticky Web and Ho-Oh and Zacian-C after a Dragon Dance. Reshiram also loves Ferrothorn on bulkier teams because it provides Reshiram a Kyogre check, some recovery with Leech Seed, and Spikes to facilitate a sweep. Necrozma-DM is great for checking Zacian-C, as unboosted Reshiram has problems with it. Lunala can help Reshiram by checking defensive Zygarde-C and other setup sweepers, like Zekrom and Groudon, that can take care of a unboosted Reshiram.</p> "

After boosting, if the opponent can still Dynamax, Ditto is a threat, as it can OHKO Kyurem-B with Max Hailstorm; Necrozma-DM, Zacian-C, and physically defensive Ferrothorn can be used to Imposter-proof it. Zacian-C in particular doubles as an offensive powerhouse that can pressure Necrozma-DM alongside Kyurem-B, each helping the other to make progress against the opposing team. A weakened Kyurem-B can also be revenge killed by faster Pokemon, such as Choice Scarf Zacian and Choice Scarf Calyrex-S, if it isn’t at +3 Speed or above. Teammates like Necrozma-DM and Yveltal, respectively, are valuable as a result, as they can switch into and wall these threats. As Life Orb Kyurem-B is vulnerable to Stealth Rock, Defoggers like Ho-Oh and Yveltal are vital partners.</p> "

Freeze-Dry can punish Kyogre for staying in while also threatening specially defensive Yveltal and Zygarde-C. Fusion Flare punishes Necrozma-DM and other Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Zacian-C for switching in more reliably than Sheer Cold can. Draco Meteor is also an option to punish opposing Kyurem-W for trying to block Sheer Cold, while also hitting Eternatus much harder than Freeze-Dry. Roost provides Kyurem-W with an invaluable source of recovery, letting it heal Kyogre’s hits and potentially PP stall Water Spout while also mitigating Stealth Rock damage. Heavy-Duty Boots is the preferred option to mitigate Stealth Rock damage and improve the matchup against opposing Sticky Web teams, but Utility Umbrella can be opted for in order to handle Choice Specs Kyogre better.

In addition, reliable Eternatus checks like Tyranitar and Calyrex-S work well alongside Kyurem-W. Reliable Defog support from the likes of Yveltal and Ho-Oh is also crucial to allow Kyurem-W to come in on Kyogre without taking Stealth Rock damage, drastically increasing its longevity.

Magic Coat allows it to force 50/50s against opposing leads that might threaten Taunt, such as Yveltal and Grimmsnarl, while also deterring Stealth Rock setters and leads like Necrozma-DM and Landorus-T. Misty Explosion is extremely useful, enabling Slurpuff to block Defog or Rapid Spin attempts from slower Pokemon like Yveltal and Excadrill after its Focus Sash has been activated, as well as potentially bringing a teammate in safely. Yawn prevents Pokemon like Necrozma-DM and Calyrex-S from setting up freely on Slurpuff, and it can give teammates free setup turns if a foe KOes Slurpuff while drowsy. Endeavor can also be used to deter setup attempts and generally cripple opposing leads, working together with Focus Sash and Unburden to allow Slurpuff to threaten Pokemon like Necrozma-DM and Xerneas, which could otherwise cleanly 2HKO it. Focus Sash is vital to set Sticky Web against faster Pokemon while also synergizing nicely with Unburden to let Slurpuff outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, allowing for a Yawn or Endeavor before it's KOed. The given EVs and IVs with a Naive nature minimize Slurpuff's bulk to help it activate Focus Sash, notably ensuring that Life Orb Yveltal's Oblivion Wing does so.</p> <p>Slurpuff fits only on hyper offense teams where its Sticky Web support can enable threatening wallbreakers and sweepers. Teammates that work especially well alongside Slurpuff include Choice Specs Kyogre and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM, which greatly appreciate outspeeding Eternatus and outspeeding Calyrex-S after a boost, respectively. Calyrex-S can also be a solid teammate thanks to its ability to block Rapid Spin from Excadrill. Since Slurpuff can't set Stealth Rock outside of using Magic Coat, a secondary lead like Landorus-T often works great alongside it, with Landorus-T additionally being able to block entry hazard removal through Explosion, gaining considerable momentum. Teammates that can use Taunt to block opposing Defog attempts later in the game are also tremendously useful, with Yveltal being the best example. Similarly, it's important to have teammates that can reliably pressure Defoggers, such as Zekrom, Xerneas, and Zacian-C, all of which can threaten Yveltal and Ho-Oh. Slurpuff should almost always be used as the lead, unless the opponent has a counter like Excadrill or a multi-hit attacker like Pheromosa.</p> "

However, if Necrozma-DM Dynamaxes too early, Xerneas can use Substitute twice followed by Max Guard to stall out its Dynamax and break through it.</p> <p><strong>Zacian-C</strong>: Bulky Zacian-C is by far the most reliable check to a boosted Xerneas, tanking Max Lightning quite easily and proceeding to take Xerneas out with Behemoth Blade. However, it must be cautious before deciding to switch in, since Xerneas can easily elect to chip it down with Moonblast or Thunder prior to actually setting up.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn</strong>: Ferrothorn checks Xerneas reliably unless Xerneas has Focus Blast, since Power Whip can break Xerneas’s Substitutes, and Ferrothorn resists both of Xerneas’s attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh, especially specially defensive variants, can quite easily outlast Xerneas's Dynamax with its own Dynamax with the sequence of Max Guard, Max Flare, and Max Guard. However, it comes down to a 50-50 after this; Ho-Oh either gets taken out by Thunder, which has a 50% chance to hit due to Max Flare setting Sun, or Xerneas gets taken out by a sun-boosted Sacred Fire.</p> ",

Moonblast is a highly spammable STAB move, capable of blasting through almost the entire defensive metagame barring Steel-types and Ho-Oh after Geomancy. Thunder is the only coverage move Xerneas needs, OHKOing Ho-Oh from full under Dynamax, removing Zacian-C after some chip damage, and heavily damaging Necrozma-DM with a chance to 2HKO even if Necrozma-DM has Dynamaxed. Additionally, Thunder allows Xerneas to fish for paralysis on Necrozma-DM, Zacian-C, and Ho-Oh on the switch. Substitute allows Xerneas to scout, potentially waste the opponent's Dynamax if they Dynamax Necrozma-DM too early in reaction to Xerneas' Dynamax, and potentially use non-Power Whip Ferrothorn as setup fodder. Power Herb is vital to allow Xerneas to set up in a single turn, while the given EV spread allows Xerneas to outspeed Slurpuff without boosts and create 101-HP Substitutes.</p> <p>Xerneas fits best on balanced, bulky offensive, and hyper offensive teams that can pressure its extremely limited number of checks.

However, Yveltal has to sacrifice its second or third moveslot for it, and Snarl doesn't alleviate its poor matchup against Calm Mind Kyogre. Sucker Punch can be used on a three attacks set with U-turn in order to potentially KO boosted Calyrex-S, which would otherwise overwhelm Yveltal with Max Starfall, as well as pick off or weaken foes like Marshadow and Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM. However, it can be scouted with Substitute Calyrex-S and is easily exploitable once the opponent is aware of it. Toxic can cripple opposing specially defensive Yveltal and Ho-Oh better but is not recommended due to it possibly making Yveltal too passive. Knock Off is an option in the last moveslot of Life Orb Yveltal to severely damage Blissey and remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Ho-Oh, making it a much less consistent check to Yveltal. However, Dynamax Sucker Punch can already pressure Blissey, while Max Darkness overwhelms Ho-Oh. Rock Slide can be used to OHKO Ho-Oh as Max Rockfall; however, Yveltal's other coverage options are generally more useful and Rock Slide weakens Ditto matchups.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls: Tyranitar is an outstanding check to Yveltal due to its sand-boosted bulk and resistance to Dark and Flying. It can force Yveltal out using Rock Tomb, Stone Edge, or Thunder Wave. However, Tyranitar relies on Rest in order to recover, which Yveltal's team can take advantage of. Specially defensive Eternatus can avoid being 2HKOed by Dark Pulse, proceeding to wear it down with Dynamax Cannon while PP stalling it with Pressure and Recover. Eternatus must be wary if Yveltal is Dynamaxed, though, as Max Darkness can easily weaken it or force it out. Ho-Oh is a great way to deal with offensive Yveltal, as it can tank its Dark Pulse, cripple it with Sacred Fire or Toxic, and eliminate any chip damage with Regenerator. Additionally, Protect Ho-Oh is a very useful way to stall out Yveltal's Dynamax turns. However, it must be careful of Yveltal's Max Darkness forcing it out. Specially defensive Yveltal can stall out Yveltal's Dynamax, remove its Life Orb with Knock Off, or disrupt it using Snarl, but is quite passive and can be shut down by Taunt as a result.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Xerneas can also capitalize on specially defensive Yveltal's passivity with Geomancy and pose a large sweeping threat. Xerneas should be careful switching into its Knock Off, though, as it will risk losing Power Herb. Zacian-C poses a fearsome threat to Yveltal, as it resists Dark Pulse and Oblivion Wing, OHKOing it regardless of Dynamax with Behemoth Blade. However, Zacian-C can easily drop to Heat Wave Yveltal. Even in cases where Yveltal lacks Heat Wave, Zacian-C will need some bulk investment to manually switch into Max Airstream. Choice Scarf Zacian can outspeed Yveltal even after a few Max Airstream boosts and threaten it with Play Rough; however, Zacian is easily overwhelmed by Max Airstream, while Play Rough fails to OHKO a healthy Dynamaxed Yveltal.</p> <p><strong>Ditto: Ditto is a useful revenge killer against Yveltal, as it can deal large amounts of damage and, if it has Dynamaxed, easily 2HKO Yveltal by using Max Airstream. However, a healthy Dynamaxed Yveltal can easily beat Ditto by withstanding Oblivion Wing or Max Airstream and retaliating with its more powerful Max Airstream.</p> <p><strong>Physically Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Physically offensive Pokemon such as Zacian-C, Groudon, setup Zygarde-C, and Zekrom force Yveltal out and can potentially use non-Foul Play variants as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off: Yveltal has to watch out for Knock Off from opposing Yveltal, Necrozma-DM, and Ferrothorn, as it becomes a lot easier to wear down with Stealth Rock , which is amplified by it very often being the only Defogger on teams. Losing Heavy-Duty Boots also makes it significantly more susceptible to Calyrex-S and entry hazard stacking cores.</p> <p><strong>Status: Walls such as Ho-Oh, Eternatus, Zygarde-C, and Toxic Ferrothorn can pressure Yveltal with the status moves they carry. Ho-Oh in particular can still cripple Taunt Yveltal with Sacred Fire, while Ferrothorn can stack up entry hazards, compelling Yveltal to come in more often and get worn down more quickly. However, both must be wary of getting their items removed by Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers</strong>: Pokemon such as Kyogre and Eternatus can heavily damage Yveltal and force it to switch out. Choice Specs Kyogre and Meteor Beam Eternatus have the potential to greatly harm or OHKO Yveltal, while bulky Calm Mind Kyogre can set up on it and Life Orb Eternatus can force it to repeatedly use Roost while fishing for poison with Sludge Bomb.</p> ",

Foul Play deals heavy damage to physically offensive Pokemon such as Zacian-C, Marshadow, and Groudon, while Knock Off cripples Ho-Oh, Yveltal, Ferrothorn, and Eternatus. U-turn allows Yveltal to maintain momentum, providing opportunities for teammates to come in safely. Taunt can be used to prevent recovery, status, setup, and entry hazards from other defensive Pokemon like Yveltal, Ferrothorn, Zygarde-C, and Necrozma-DM – it works particularly well alongside a faster spread. Knock Off and Foul Play can also be used together to threaten physical sweepers while still being able to make progress against Eternatus and Yveltal. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Yveltal from getting worn down by Stealth Rock. 72 Defense EVs ensure that Yveltal always survives Poltergeist into Close Combat from Adamant Life Orb Marshadow. The remaining EVs are put into HP and Special Defense with a Careful nature to ensure that Yveltal can take attacks from Life Orb Calyrex-S and specially offensive Yveltal as well as possible. Maximum Special Defense investment is an option as well if Marshadow is not a concern. A fast spread of 248 HP / 8 Def / 60 SpD / 192 Spe along with a Jolly Nature allows Yveltal to switch into Life Orb Groudon and Landorus-T as they use Swords Dance and use Foul Play before they can attack, threatening to OHKO them unless they Dynamax.</p> <p>Yveltal best fits on balance teams, and its defensive presence is appreciated by Pokemon vulnerable to Calyrex-S such as Necrozma-DM and Eternatus. Necrozma-DM, in return, checks Zacian-C and Xerneas, which are common threats to Yveltal, while Eternatus is able to check Kyogre and relieve some pressure on checking special Yveltal. Blissey is able to check threats to Yveltal such as Kyogre, Meteor Beam Eternatus, and Xerneas. Ferrothorn also limits Kyogre and Xerneas, while Yveltal can support Ferrothorn's entry hazards by removing Heavy-Duty Boots with Knock Off and preventing Defog if carrying Taunt. Physically defensive walls such as Lunala and Zygarde-C can check physically offensive Pokemon such as Groudon and Zekrom, which pose a huge threat to non-Foul Play Yveltal. Ho-Oh can be useful to pressure opposing Ferrothorn and Yveltal, pivot into Zacian-C, and absorb status, and it has the option to use a more offensive set with Yveltal fulfilling the Defogger role.

Calyrex-S in particular appreciates Yveltal Imposter-proofing its team and pressuring opposing Yveltal with Knock Off or Taunt. In return, Calyrex-S forces out Zacian-C and Eternatus, can use Aromatherapy, and checks many boosted threats with its Choice Scarf set. A revenge killer like Ditto or the aforementioned Choice Scarf Calyrex-S are useful teammates, preventing Calyrex-S from completely sweeping the team if Yveltal is removed from a match.</p> "

Its typing also allows it to soft check Calyrex-S, which can otherwise tear apart teams easily. Dark Pulse can be difficult to withstand due to Dark Aura, while Max Darkness overwhelms walls such as Eternatus and Ho-Oh by lowering their Special Defense. Oblivion Wing turns into Max Airstream, letting Yveltal outspeed much of the metagame while hitting foes that resist Dark Pulse such as Xerneas and offensive Yveltal for massive damage. Oblivion Wing also gives Yveltal a useful source of recovery, which lets it outlast Calyrex-S and offset Stealth Rock damage. Taunt shuts down specially defensive Yveltal, Blissey, and entry hazard leads such as Shuckle. In addition, it's useful on hyper offense teams to prevent Defog from the likes of Ho-Oh and specially defensive Yveltal, and it can provide safe setup opportunities for teammates by stopping status moves. Sucker Punch is used to play mind games with Calyrex-S, KO weakened threats like Marshadow and Groudon, and wreck Blissey as physical Max Darkness. Roost is an alternative to keep Yveltal consistently healthy in the face of Life Orb and Stealth Rock damage, preventing it from being in KO range of Calyrex-S. Heat Wave is another viable option to KO Zacian-C as Max Flare or after summoning sun with it. Life Orb enhances Dynamax Yveltal's power to unbearable levels, while a Mild nature bolsters its STAB moves without compromising any power on Sucker Punch against Calyrex-S; Sticky Webs teams will need to use Taunt and a Hasty nature in order to prevent Defog from opposing Yveltal. 68 SpD EVs should be run with Roost in order to avoid a 2HKO from Choice Specs Calyrex-S's Astral Barrage. Heavy-Duty Boots is another option for balance teams that aim to use Yveltal as a Baton Pass recipient.</p> <p>Specially offensive Yveltal fits best on hyper offense and bulky offense teams as a threatening Dynamax sweeper and soft check to Calyrex-S, which is otherwise extremely difficult to handle. Yveltal is most notably checked by bulky Eternatus, Ho-Oh, specially defensive Yveltal, and Tyranitar. Teammates that can limit these threats such as Calyrex-S, Kyogre, Zacian-C, and Groudon, respectively, are beneficial. In return, Yveltal can shut down most of their checks such as bulky Yveltal, bulky Eternatus, Necrozma-DM, and Lunala, respectively. Calyrex-S is notable for its potential to pass Nasty Plot boosts to Yveltal, helping it break through checks such as specially defensive Eternatus and Ho-Oh. Necrozma-DM is a useful partner to deal with Xerneas and Zacian-C, which is a good answer to Yveltal if it isn't running Heat Wave. Yveltal is crippled by Stealth Rock, so teammates that can get rid of it such as Ho-Oh on bulky offense teams, which is integral due to this set replacing bulky Yveltal, and Excadrill and Regieleki on hyper offense teams are appreciated. Ho-Oh is an especially important partner on bulky offense teams as a second line of defense against Calyrex-S. Shuckle provides Sticky Web support, which lets Yveltal outspeed threats like Zacian-C, Marshadow, Calyrex-S, and Groudon without relying on Max Airstream. Yveltal can struggle against Ditto once it has Dynamaxed, so countermeasures to it such as Regieleki, Ho-Oh, and Zacian-C if Yveltal decides to forego Heat Wave are required.</p> "

Substitute can be used over Rest on the defensive set with Glare in order to set up on some passive targets and serve as a win condition, but this sacrifices utility against a few Pokemon Zygarde-C otherwise checks, such as Ho-Oh. The Dragon Dance set can run Rest instead of Substitute in order to remove status, but it is not recommended due to it leaving Zygarde-C vulnerable. However, running Rest with Thousand Waves over Dragon Tail or Toxic lets Zygarde-C lure Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn into a false sense of security after revealing the lack of Substitute. After trapping these targets, Zygarde-C can proceed to boost up all the way to +6 and clean up. However, this strategy is not very reliable on the whole. Outrage or Stone Edge instead of Dragon Tail or Toxic makes Dragon Dance Zygarde-C more directly threatening, but both options are inferior in more drawn-out games, which Zygarde-C thrives in, and locking into Outrage makes it more vulnerable to Xerneas and Zacian-C. Life Orb Zygarde-C can use Crunch in its fourth moveslot as an option for breaking defensive Lunala. It should be noted that fully defensive Lunala survives +1 Max Darkness with Shadow Shield, so the best way to work around a fully defensive Lunala is to predict its switch in and Crunch that turn for a clean 2HKO. If Lunala is not running a fully defensive set, you can feel safe to set up a Dragon Dance and Dynamax with Crunch to break through.

Eternatus can particularly threaten Zygarde-C by ignoring the effects of Dynamax with Dynamax Cannon. However, they must be careful of Dragon Tail or Max Wyrmwind dealing heavy damage to them.

Stone Edge allows Zygarde-C to KO Ho-Oh, Shedinja, and defensive Yveltal with a bit of chip.

Wallbreakers that are also less reliant on Dynamax such as Choice Specs Kyogre pair well, as Zygarde-C appreciates the great deal of additional bulk, Special Defense boosts, and power it receives during Dynamax. Zygarde-C with Rest also appreciates cleric support from Aromatherapy and Heal Bell users such as Choice-item Calyrex-S, Xerneas, and Blissey. Defensively, Life Orb Zygarde-C values teammates that check Xerneas and Kyogre such as Ho-Oh and Ferrothorn, respectively. Life Orb Zygarde-C has no form of reliable recovery and is relatively frail, so it cannot be used to check bulky attackers such as Groudon without taking crippling amounts of damage that ruin its setup potential. Due to its fragility and preference to keep Power Construct intact for Dynamax, Life Orb Zygarde-C needs teammates such as defensive Kyogre that act as defensive cornerstones to switch into opposing attackers. Fairy-types such as Zacian-C and Xerneas are useful to switch into Ditto, which can revenge kill Zygarde-C with Outrage.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Defensive Zygarde-C is one of AG's premier physically defensive walls due to its decent typing, great utility moves, and gigantic bulk letting it check a ton of offensive and defensive Pokemon such as Groudon, Marshadow lacking Ice Punch, Necrozma-DM, Zacian-C lacking Play Rough, and Ho-Oh. Thousand Arrows ignores Ground immunities from Pokemon like Ho-Oh and Yveltal, offering nearly unresisted coverage. Rest is Zygarde-C's only recovery move and circumvents Toxic and Will-O-Wisp from the likes of Lunala, Ho-Oh, Giratina, and Necrozma-DM, allowing it to serve as a reliable status absorber. Coil turns Zygarde-C into a threatening bulky sweeper, letting it take advantage of defensive Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Ho-Oh, and Necrozma-DM and go toe to toe with offensive Pokemon like Groudon, Dragon Dance Necrozma-DM, and Swords Dance Zacian-C. Alternatively, Haze can be run over Coil to remove boosts from threatening setup sweepers like offensive Groudon, Dragon Dance Zygarde-C, Swords Dance Zacian-C, and Bulk Up Marshadow, although it makes Zygarde-C almost entirely passive. Glare provides amazing support, paralyzing faster foes like Calyrex-S, Xerneas, and Marshadow for Zygarde-C and its teammates. Dragon Tail is also an option over Glare to phaze bulky walls that can handle Zygarde-C like Lunala and Gothitelle, which is otherwise able to trap and PP stall it, and counteract Ho-Oh's Whirlwind. It also becomes Max Wyrmwind under Dynamax, letting Zygarde-C check Groudon better. Scale Shot is a noteworthy mention, as it enables Zygarde-C to outspeed foes like bulky Eternatus, offensive Yveltal, and unboosted Zekrom, making it an even more threatening bulky sweeper paired with Coil. Thousand Waves alongside Scale Shot gives Zygarde-C plenty of room to boost up to nigh-invincible levels after trapping a passive foe such as Ferrothorn or Necrozma-DM. However, Glare and Dragon Tail are generally more useful because they offer better utility to teams, and the Defense drop from Scale Shot disrupts Coil's Defense increases, making it useless without Thousand Waves. 56 Speed EVs let Zygarde-C outspeed some Gothitelle spreads, paralyzed Zacian-C, and paralyzed Calyrex-S, while the remaining EVs and the Impish nature make Zygarde-C more effective against physical attackers such as Groudon, Zacian-C, and Marshadow. If forgoing Glare, Zygarde-C can run an alternative spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD.</p> <p>Zygarde-C fits best on balance teams, since it can check threats like Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Ho-Oh while providing invaluable support with Glare. However, it can be exploited by a bunch of top-tier threats in AG such as Xerneas, Eternatus, Calyrex-S, and Kyogre. Teammates that check these threats such as Necrozma-DM, Calyrex-S, Yveltal, and Eternatus or Kyurem-W, respectively, are thus useful. Necrozma-DM can also deal with Play Rough Zacian-C, which is particularly threatening to Zygarde-C, while also providing Stealth Rock support, which Zygarde-C can take advantage of using Dragon Tail. Partners that can deal with Lunala like Yveltal, Marshadow, and Calyrex-S are also appreciated. Ferrothorn synergizes fantastically with Zygarde-C, as it provides Spikes support, which lets Zygarde-C chip down grounded foes using Dragon Tail, while also checking Xerneas and Kyogre for it. In return, Zygarde-C checks Pokemon that threaten Ferrothorn like Ho-Oh, Groudon, and Marshadow lacking Ice Punch. Offensive teammates like Zacian-C and Marshadow benefit a lot from Zygarde-C's Glare support, as it enables them to outspeed fast foes like Calyrex-S and Zacian-C, respectively. Despite Zygarde-C checking Groudon and Marshadow, Zygarde can be OHKOed by Precipice Blades after a Swords Dance boost before Power Construct activates, and Marshadow can carry Ice Punch to beat Zygarde-C. As a result, revenge killers or secondary checks to them like Ditto, Xerneas, and Eternatus are useful.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Dragon Dance Zygarde-C is a threatening setup sweeper, wincon, and Dynamax user in AG because it uses passive Pokemon like Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, and Ho-Oh as setup bait, giving it a good matchup against defensive teams. Substitute protects Zygarde-C against moves such as Toxic, Knock Off, Leech Seed, and Sacred Fire from Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, and Ho-Oh while giving it safe opportunities to set Dragon Dance up to take on faster foes. Thousand Arrows heavily damages prominent Pokemon such as Zacian-C, Eternatus, and Necrozma-DM after a boost while hitting the vast majority of the metagame for at least neutral damage. Dragon Tail allows Zygarde-C to get rid of threats such as Ho-Oh and Lugia before they phaze it with Whirlwind. Alternatively, Toxic may be used to severely cripple both Lunala and Lugia and defeat the niche Shedinja. Under Dynamax, Thousand Arrows turns into Max Quake, which boosts Zygarde-C's Special Defense, allowing it to tank even super effective attacks such as Ice Beam from Lunala and Moonblast from Xerneas. Dragon Tail turns into Max Wyrmwind under Dynamax, allowing Zygarde-C to hit Flying- and Dragon-types such as Yveltal and opposing Zygarde-C without negative priority. 16 HP EVs increase Zygarde-C's Leftovers recovery, and, with an Impish nature and 36 Defense EVs, prevent moves such as Ferrothorn's Power Whip, defensive Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike, and Ho-Oh's Brave Bird from breaking its Substitute in its Complete forme. 232 EVs invested in Speed allow Zygarde-C to outspeed everything up to Adamant Zacian-C and Eternatus at +1 Speed. The remaining EVs are allocated into Attack in order to maximize firepower. An alternative 16 HP / 100 Atk / 148 Def / 244 Spe EV spread with a Jolly nature may be run instead in order to outspeed Calyrex-S at +1 without losing bulk. It comes at the cost of some power, however.</p> <p>Zygarde-C best fits on balance teams. A way to pressure Lunala and Lugia is crucial if Zygarde-C forgoes Toxic, as both can easily check it for a long period of time. The likes of Tyranitar, Calyrex-S, Ho-Oh, and Yveltal can work well in this regard, but the latter three must be wary of either Moongeist Beam or Meteor Beam from Power Herb Lunala. Ferrothorn and bulky Eternatus can check Zygarde-C's next largest roadblock in Kyogre, which threatens Zygarde-C with Ice Beam, while setting up Spikes and Toxic Spikes, respectively, making Dragon Tail more threatening for the opponent. Teammates such as Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM can check another common threat to Zygarde-C in Xerneas. Necrozma-DM can check Play Rough Zacian-C, which can OHKO an unboosted Zygarde-C. Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Zacian-C can pressure Haze Zygarde-C variants, which may trouble Dragon Dance Zygarde-C by preventing it from setting up. On top of that, Zygarde-C hugely benefits from Xerneas and Zacian-C's ability to lure in Necrozma-DM and Ho-Oh, which creates setup opportunities for Zygarde-C.</p> "

Knock Off and its ability to spread status make it a nuisance to a lot of Pokemon, chipping down teams slowly and taking advantage of passive Pokemon that can't damage it heavily like Thunder Wave Necrozma-DM, defensive Eternatus, and Ho-Oh. It can check all of Marshadow, defensive Yveltal, and Calm Mind Kyogre, and it can chip Zacian-C heavily with Rocky Helmet and Wild Charge recoil if it tries taking Toxapex down. Scald is required to make Toxapex less passive, threatening burns on Pokemon that otherwise set up freely such as Zacian-C and Necrozma-DM. Even with it, though, Haze is mandatory to prevent setup sweepers such as Bulk Up Marshadow and Calm Mind Kyogre from turning Toxapex into a liability for a team. Knock Off provides item displacement and a strong way to hit Calyrex-S trying to set up on Toxapex, which is very valuable to reduce passivity and make that matchup less detrimental. Toxic and Toxic Spikes chip down the opposing team more quickly than Scald, but the heavy presence of Eternatus make these options rarely reach their full potential. Rocky Helmet can wear down Pokemon like Zacian-C, Urshifu-S, and U-turn pivots in Pheromosa and Galarian Darmanitan, while Shed Shell prevents Toxapex from being trapped by Gothitelle, otherwise being essentially a guaranteed KO for it.</p> <p>Necrozma-DM appreciates Toxapex scouting for Assurance on Zacian-C and chipping it more with Rocky Helmet. Toxapex can also remove Heavy-Duty Boots from Ho-Oh and Yveltal, the most common Defog users, making them easier to wear down. Toxapex also checks Marshadow and most Dark-types, which threaten Necrozma-DM, unless they Dynamax. Offensive wallbreakers like Kyogre and Yveltal checked by Eternatus enjoy Toxapex pressuring it with Knock Off and Scald burns. Yveltal also helps by being immune to Ground and switching into Calyrex-S, covering for two of Toxapex's greatest weaknesses. Lunala is a good wall for Zekrom, Groudon, and Zygarde, which can all threaten Toxapex with strong super effective STAB moves, and Toxapex in return can pivot into Marshadow, Urshifu-S, and Yveltal, which pressure Lunala. Blissey is the sturdiest special sponge in the metagame, walling special attackers that can muscle past Toxapex like Life Orb Eternatus, Geomancy-boosted Xerneas, and Choice Specs Kyogre. Ho-Oh and Toxapex can form a Regenerator core that shuts down most defensive teams with infinite passive healing and spreading status.</p> "

Utility Umbrella is a helpful item to stop Kyogre's rain from making Morning Sun less effective. Shed Shell can specifically be used for Gothitelle, which traps Necrozma-DM and PP stalls it with Charm, Taunt, and Rest. Toxic is also a solid option on defensive Necrozma-DM's third moveslot to cripple common switch-ins to it like Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Dragon Dance Zygarde-C. Running Toxic does, however, make the matchup against Swords Dance Zacian-C particularly tricky to handle. Knock Off is an option over Stone Edge on the Dragon Dance set to severely damage Lunala; however, losing the ability to OHKO Ho-Oh can be suboptimal.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Super Effective Attackers: Powerful wallbreakers that carry super effective STAB moves such as Calyrex-S, Yveltal, Marshadow, and Groudon are to able to greatly pressure Necrozma-DM by forcing it out and getting a chance to set up, which can be threatening for Necrozma-DM's team to deal with.

Dragon Dance can be used if a team already has a Stealth Rock setter, allowing Necrozma-DM to potentially set up on foes like Zacian-C and opposing Necrozma-DM before devastating and outspeeding foes like defensive Eternatus and Marshadow after a couple of boosts. Sunsteel Strike gives Necrozma-DM the means to KO Xerneas while chipping down Zacian-C. However, if opting for Thunder Wave, Necrozma-DM should run Iron Head in order to paraflinch foes like Yveltal and Eternatus while having more PP. Earthquake consistently deals good damage to Zekrom, opposing Necrozma-DM, and Zacian-C while 2HKOing offensive Eternatus. Earthquake is particularly good alongside Dragon Dance as well, as few resist both it and Sunsteel Strike, and it turns Necrozma-DM into an obnoxiously sturdy Dynamax user between Max Steelspike boosting Defense and Max Quake boosting Special Defense. Thunder Wave is an option over Earthquake to cripple fast foes like Zacian-C, Calyrex-S, and Eternatus, but it makes Necrozma-DM setup fodder against Groudon due to its immunity to Thunder Wave. Alternatively, Knock Off cripples switch-ins to Necrozma-DM such as Groudon, Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Eternatus for its teammates. Morning Sun is essential in order to keep Necrozma-DM healthy and check the likes of Zacian-C and Xerneas without being heavily chipped. However, use Morning Sun with caution, as it has very low PP. Rocky Helmet deals residual damage to foes like Zacian-C and Zekrom. Heavy-Duty Boots is an option over Rocky Helmet to reliably switch into Zacian-C's Assurance if Stealth Rock or Spikes is on the field. Weakness Policy pairs well with Dragon Dance, as Necrozma-DM can tank super effective hits like Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire, Eternatus's Mystical Fire, and Marshadow's Shadow Sneak due to its good bulk and Prism Armor while getting a +2 Attack boost. Maximum Defense investment with an Impish nature ensures Zacian-C's Close Combat won't 2HKO Necrozma-DM at full health.

Unfortunately, Necrozma-DM is easily forced out and set up on by many other top-tier wallbreakers in AG such as Calyrex-S, Life Orb Yveltal, Marshadow, and Groudon. Therefore, partners that can check these threats such as Yveltal, Eternatus, Zacian-C, and Lunala, respectively, are useful. Teammates that are especially weak to Zacian-C and Xerneas like Yveltal, Zygarde-C, and Eternatus appreciate Necrozma-DM checking the two. Ferrothorn is able to act as a secondary check to Xerneas, which is useful because Xerneas can 2HKO Necrozma-DM with Thunder at +2 and force it to Dynamax, and Ferrothorn also deals with Kyogre while providing Spikes support. Defoggers like Yveltal and Ho-Oh serve a unique purpose for Necrozma-DM, as they stop Stealth Rock and Spikes from strengthening Zacian-C's Assurance on the switch. Revenge killers like Ditto and Choice Scarf Calyrex-S are useful partners, dealing with Zacian-C if it has potentially KOed Necrozma-DM.</p> "

Marshadow is rather frail and should avoid switching directly into attacks such as Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike and Yveltal's or Tyranitar's Foul Play, so try to get it in via double switches and slow pivoting. Stealth Rock support allows Marshadow to achieve KOs on Kyogre and offensive Yveltal, although it has to be wary of Sucker Punch from the latter, while Defog prevents entry hazards from wearing down Marshadow as it repeatedly switches in and out over the course of a match.

However, it is hard to justify using over another coverage move, especially because Assurance can already 2HKO Necrozma-DM on the switch if Stealth Rock or Spikes is up. If running Fire Fang, use Play Rough instead of Close Combat. Substitute is an option over Assurance to block Ditto from transforming into Zacian-C. However, replacing Assurance or Swords Dance means that Zacian-C has almost no way to deal with Necrozma-DM. Crunch is an option on Zacian-C to pressure Necrozma-DM without relying on Stealth Rock or Spikes. It is also more reliable than Close Combat at pressuring Necrozma-DM, as it doesn't lower Zacian-C's defenses. A specially defensive set with Rest and Sleep Talk is an option for bulky balance and stall teams that need counterplay to mixed Life Orb or Taunt Yveltal; even without investment, Zacian-C's damage output is impressive. Its lack of passivity serves to distinguish it from Tyranitar, the Pokemon that is more typically used to answer offensive Yveltal on such teams, but it is generally overshadowed by the latter as it checks fewer threats overall.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Necrozma-DM: Necrozma-DM is by far the most reliable check to Zacian-C, being able to tank most of its attacks thanks to its great bulk and threaten it back with Sunsteel Strike or chip damage from Rocky Helmet. However, Necrozma-DM without Heavy-Duty Boots cannot reliably switch into Zacian-C if Stealth Rock or Spikes is on its side of the field, as it risks being crippled by Assurance, putting it into OHKO range for Close Combat. It also has to recover with Morning Sun if it switches in on Close Combat, which teams can take advantage of due to its very low PP.

Its good bulk and typing allow it to deal with Xerneas, Eternatus, and Yveltal, offering valuable defensive utility. Behemoth Blade is preferred over Play Rough for preventing Pokemon such as Yveltal and Groudon from effectively using Dynamax defensively against Zacian-C while also reliably OHKOing Xerneas. Wild Charge OHKOes specially defensive Yveltal after minimal chip damage, deals with Ho-Oh, and devastates Kyogre. Close Combat provides good coverage for Ferrothorn and 2HKOes a weakened Necrozma-DM. Assurance deals great damage to Zacian-C's most reliable check in Necrozma-DM if it switches in while Stealth Rock or Spikes is on the field and prevents Lunala from reliably checking it. Zacian-C can alternatively run Swords Dance, boosting its already terrific Attack to break through physically defensive walls such as Zygarde-C, Giratina, and Necrozma-DM. However, this makes Zacian-C and its team more vulnerable to Ditto. Play Rough is also a decent pick, letting Zacian-C defeat Zygarde-C, Zekrom, and Giratina. An Adamant nature enhances Zacian-C's damage output while leaving it fast enough to outspeed much of the metagame. The given spread ensures that Zacian-C will survive +2 Max Lightning from Geomancy Xerneas after Stealth Rock, while also outspeeding Modest Eternatus. Some other spreads are possible as well: for example, a spread of 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe with an Adamant nature can be used on offensive teams or balance teams with strong counterplay to Xerneas and Yveltal. If a team desires speed control, a Jolly nature with 112 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed Adamant Zacian-C and anything slower. Speed investment beyond this is generally not desirable and detracts from Zacian-C's good bulk.</p> <p>Zacian-C is an excellent fit on bulky offense and balance teams due to its great wallbreaking potential, amazing Speed tier, bulk, and typing, which make it a decent check to Xerneas, Eternatus, and Yveltal.

Therefore, teammates that can deal with these threats such as Yveltal, Eternatus, and Calyrex-S, respectively, are appreciated. Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn can provide Stealth Rock or Spikes support for Zacian-C, invalidating Necrozma-DM as a switch-in to Assurance Zacian-C if it lacks Heavy-Duty Boots. Kyogre's Drizzle is useful for Zacian-C, as it restricts Necrozma-DM's ability to consistently heal with Morning Sun. Partners like Necrozma-DM and Ho-Oh should be used in order to check Ditto once it has copied Zacian-C. Offensive teammates such as Calyrex-S, Life Orb Yveltal, and Xerneas can pressure physically defensive checks to Zacian-C such as Necrozma-DM, Zygarde-C, and Giratina. Xerneas also forms a great offensive core with Zacian-C; Xerneas is able to stall out Dynamax turns from Necrozma-DM with Substitute and 2HKO it with Thunder at +2, leaving it weakened so Zacian-C can KO it. In return, Zacian-C can take care of Ferrothorn. Gothitelle is another noteworthy pick on balance teams, as Zacian-C can lure in Necrozma-DM so Gothitelle can trap it and PP stall it.</p> "

Dynamax Cannon provides valuable coverage against the likes of Palkia, Adamant Marshadow, Zekrom, and Zygarde-C and hits most neutral targets for good damage. Additionally, it effectively bypasses the effects of Dynamax, threatening foes such as Groudon, Zekrom, and Reshiram.

Dragon Tail can be used to phaze and deter Gothitelle, as well as setup sweepers such as Zekrom and Calm Mind Kyogre, but is fairly weak. Flamethrower nails Steel-types such as Necrozma-DM, Zacian-C, and Ferrothorn. Mystical Fire is a slightly weaker alternative that limits Calm Mind Kyogre for a good while alongside Toxic, heavily annoys Geomancy Xerneas seeking to set up, and generally weakens special attackers such as opposing Eternatus and offensive Yveltal. Toxic is most useful when running Dynamax Cannon, crippling Ho-Oh, bulky Yveltal, and Lunala, while also forcing Calm Mind Kyogre to use Rest. Toxic Spikes can situationally be devastating, especially against hyper offensive teams, as it puts sweepers like Calyrex-S, Xerneas, Zekrom, and Groudon on timers. It works best alongside Sludge Bomb so Eternatus can still poison Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Lunala. However, Eternatus's own popularity spells doom for the overall effectiveness of Toxic Spikes, and common Pokemon in Zacian-C, Yveltal, Necrozma-DM, and Ferrothorn are naturally immune to the move. Recover with Pressure lets Eternatus outlast every passive Pokemon in the metagame, including staples such as defensive Yveltal, Necrozma-DM, and Ho-Oh. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Eternatus mitigate entry hazards such as Sticky Web and Stealth Rock, giving it a better matchup against Kyogre. Alternatively, Black Sludge can be used for passive recovery. Sitrus Berry is another alternative and is useful against Marshadow, making Poltergeist unable to deal damage once the item is activated.

Yveltal is a required teammate, being the only decent check to the hugely threatening Calyrex-S. Necrozma-DM can take on Zacian-C, a big threat to Eternatus. It also forms an entry hazard stacking core with Toxic Spikes Eternatus. Lunala is capable of taking on boosted Zekrom, Zygarde-C, and the extremely dangerous Groudon. In return, Eternatus can serve as a status absorber against the likes of Ho-Oh and opposing Eternatus. As Eternatus is easily capable of switching into defensive Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM, bulky Yveltal, and Ferrothorn in the long run, Pokemon checked by them such as Zacian-C, Calyrex-S, and Kyogre make for great teammates.</p> "

Assurance OHKOes Calyrex-S, even without prior hazard damage, and nails other Ghost-types like Lunala that spinblock Regieleki. Life Orb with an Adamant nature maximizes Regieleki's damage output, making it a better revenge killer and increasing damage against bulky walls such as Eternatus.</p> <p>Regieleki primarily fits on hyper offense teams, as they greatly appreciate its Rapid Spin support, and its fantastic Speed tier prevents fast threats such as Choice Scarf Kyogre, Zacian-C, and Calyrex-S from wrecking the team. Regieleki particularly struggles against entry hazard setters like Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn, as their Rocky Helmet and Iron Barbs, respectively, can wear it down, while Wild Charge cannot deal too much damage against them. Its mediocre bulk leaves it very susceptible to their moves in return. Teammates that can pressure these foes such as Life Orb Yveltal, Calyrex-S, and Groudon are thus appreciated. Regieleki struggles against Electric-resistant Pokemon such as Groudon, Zekrom, and Zygarde-C, only having Explosion to meaningfully hit them. Teammates that can enter after Explosion and deal with them such as Xerneas, Calyrex-S, and Life Orb Yveltal are beneficial.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>High Horsepower can be used over Swords Dance to attain perfect coverage and is useful against threats like Necrozma-DM and Zacian-C. However, forgoing Swords Dance makes fighting Necrozma-DM more awkward, as Calyrex-I will be forced to take Rocky Helmet damage when attempting to wear it down. A bulkier version of a Substitute set can be run with Iron Defense, Body Press, and Glacial Lance alongside a 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Spe EV spread. This set has the benefit of being a sturdier check to Zygarde-C and Zekrom, though it struggles to overcome Necrozma-DM that can Dynamax. Heavy-Duty Boots can be used to remove chip from Stealth Rock, allowing Calyrex-I to switch in more easily, although Leftovers synergizes well with Substitute.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Several Pokemon are able to revenge-kill Calyrex-I, such as Zacian-C, Marshadow, Calyrex-S, and offensive Yveltal. A healthy Zacian-C can take on Calyrex-I unless it’s boosted and behind a Substitute; Spectral Thief Marshadow can threaten it regardless of Attack boosts and Substitute. Calyrex-S and Yveltal should only be used to revenge kill if Calyrex-I isn’t behind a Substitute. Most of these Pokemon appreciate having the opposing Dynamax already used to minimize the risk of getting KOed instead.</p> <p><strong>Kyogre: Given its Ice resistance and neutrality to High Horsepower, Kyogre can usually switch in safely and damage Calyrex-I greatly with its STAB moves. With Scald, Kyogre can pressure Calyrex-I by threatening to burn it, negating recovery from Leftovers and drastically reducing its offensive power. Rest lets Kyogre heal when Calyrex-I chips it enough to threaten a KO. Even bulky Kyogre usually outspeed Calyrex-I, forcing it out unless it is behind a Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Calyrex-I taking 25% from Stealth Rock means that it struggles when it’s repeatedly forced out. While Stealth Rock is the most dangerous hazard for Calyrex-I, Spikes and Toxic Spikes are also to be watched out for, as extra chip and getting poisoned can force Calyrex-I to rely on Leech Seed more often.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>While Calyrex-I is negatively affected by not being able to be used with Calyrex-S on the same team, it is an effective wallbreaker with Substitute + Leech Seed due to its good bulk, great Attack, and very powerful STAB move in Glacial Lance, which can quickly dent Necrozma-DM. Having a strong move for Dragon- and Ground-types is integral for forcing out Pokemon such as Zygarde-C, Eternatus, and Groudon. Substitute can be used on forced switches for easier setup aided by Calyrex-I's bulk. Leech Seed allows Calyrex-I behind Substitute to overwhelm Necrozma-DM over time. Calyrex-I's comparatively low uninvested HP increases Leech Seed's healing, helping it offset Substitute damage. Swords Dance boosts Calyrex-I's Attack to ludicrous levels when it is given the chance, which is often given the amount of switches it forces. As One can make it progressively harder to deal with Calyrex-I, although its Speed hinders its ability to outright sweep. A Jolly nature allows it to outspeed paralyzed Zacian-C and uninvested Pokemon with base 90 Speed such as Ho-Oh and defensive Groudon.</p> <p>Calyrex-I is best used on bulky balance teams that appreciate its ability to lure in and overwhelm Necrozma-DM and check dangerous wallbreakers in Zygarde-C and Zekrom in a pinch. Zacian-C and Xerneas are by far the best offensive partners, benefitting massively from Calyrex-I's ability to pressure Necrozma-DM. In return, both can threaten Yveltal and Marshadow. Calyrex-I appreciates partners that can slow foes down and check switch-ins. Zygarde-C is an excellent partner with Glare, allowing Calyrex-I to usually outspeed and gain free turns to set up with Swords Dance. It also deals with Marshadow lacking Ice Punch. As bulky Kyogre is Calyrex-I’s most effective wall, checks to it such as Eternatus and Kyurem-W are valuable, with the former sapping Scald PP with Pressure and the latter pressuring Kyogre with Freeze-Dry. Ferrothorn frustrates Kyogre with Spikes and Knock Off. Necrozma-DM is a useful partner as well, being a Thunder Wave user and a Zacian-C check. Calyrex-I benefits Necrozma-DM by using Leech Seed on Zacian-C switching in and offensively checking Zygarde-C. Defoggers such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal are vital, as entry hazards heavily chip Calyrex-I every time it switches in.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Draining Kiss and Leaf Storm can both be used over Aromatherapy, allowing Calyrex-S to break through Yveltal and Tyranitar more directly. However, Draining Kiss is very weak, Leaf Storm weakens Calyrex-S, and neither offers much over Trick. Baton Pass is another niche option, allowing Calyrex-S to effectively bait in Yveltal and Tyranitar for the likes of Zacian-C and Xerneas. Colbur Berry is potentially worthwhile when Dynamaxed to survive attacks from Yveltal as well as Necrozma-DM's Knock Off, hitting them back with +2 Max Starfall or Astral Barrage. Leaf Storm can KO Tyranitar after a Nasty Plot boost, but it has no other use and its Special Attack drop can be unfavorable. On Choice Scarf, Nasty Plot can be used over Aromatherapy for potentially sweeping after using Trick, which can be particularly effective as a Choice-locked Yveltal, Tyranitar or Blissey is far less effective at countering Calyrex-S. However requiring Trick to be used first makes this strategy quite unreliable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Yveltal, especially if specially defensive, completely shuts down Calyrex-S and can switch into any of its moves with near impunity bar Trick. Tyranitar can switch freely into all of Calyrex-S's attacks except the rare Leaf Storm and then force it out by threatening an OHKO with Foul Play. Tyranitar can then take advantage of the forced switch by setting up Stealth Rock or crippling a switch-in with Thunder Wave. Tyranitar is also vulnerable to Trick but continues to reliably switch into and force out Calyrex-S even after Trick. Yveltal and Tyranitar should also be wary of +2 Max Starfall, as it can OHKO them. Urshifu-S can force out Calyrex-S with Sucker Punch, but it cannot reliably switch into Astral Barrage, Leaf Storm, or Draining Kiss. While SubSeed Calyrex-S is built to take on some Yveltal sets, the threat of certain coverage moves is still great. Snarl OHKOes Calyrex-S through Substitute, rendering this set almost useless against Yveltal carrying it. Tyranitar normally carries Rock Blast or Roar, letting it simultaneously break Substitutes and deal damage or phaze Calyrex-S while it tries to set up.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Normal-types: Porygon2 can tank many of Calyrex-S's attacks due to its good bulk, heavily damage it with Foul Play, and pivot into another teammate with Teleport if Calyrex-S switches out. However, Porygon2 dislikes being crippled by Trick, limiting its ability to use its moves with ease while losing its Eviolite. Blissey, Chansey, and Porygon2 comfortably switch into Nasty Plot Calyrex-S if it's lacking Psyshock. However, Blissey gets OHKOed by boosted Psyshock, Chansey gets OHKOed by boosted Psyshock after minor chip damage, and Porygon2 has to watch out for +2 Max Mindstorm. With Astral Barrage as the only attack on the SubSeed set Normal-types are almost guaranteed to wall the set completely. With Taunt and Leech Seed damage, it can potentially wear down Blissey, Chansey, and Porygon2, but this is a very slow process and doesn't allow Calyrex-S to run Nasty Plot, leaving it weaker against other walls like Ho-Oh paired with Normal-types.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Calyrex-S can be revenge killed by a few Pokemon. Ditto can come in after Calyrex-S gets a KO and threaten to reverse sweep. Choice Scarf users such as Kyogre, Galarian Darmanitan, Zacian, and opposing Calyrex-S can force Calyrex-S out. Marshadow can pick off Calyrex-S with Shadow Sneak. Sand Rush Excadrill under sand can also revenge kill Calyrex-S, and it can set up after forcing Calyrex-S out. Priority moves such as Yveltal's Sucker Punch and Marshadow's Shadow Sneak OHKO Calyrex-S, forcing it out every time they come in. However, not all Yveltal have Sucker Punch, so it is important to scout for it. Nasty Plot Calyrex-S can also situationally beat all of these revenge killers if it's running Focus Sash and is at full health, although this is not a reliable form of counterplay, and the rare Substitute handles Ditto. SubSeed Calyrex-S can block revenge killing attempts behind a Substitute, but faster Pokemon like Pheromosa, Choice Scarf Calyrex-S, and Shadow Sneak Marshadow still pressure it.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh: Ho-Oh can safely switch into any attack, though is crippled by Trick. Cores featuring Ho-Oh and a Dark-type such as Tyranitar or Yveltal are incredibly hard for Calyrex-S to make progress against, as it can only cripple one foe with Trick. Ho-Oh's phazing ability and bulk to take even boosted hits lets it be a sturdy check to SubSeed Calyrex-S.</p> ",

Additionally, thanks to As One and the ability to Dynamax, Calyrex-S has tremendous snowballing potential. Psyshock lets Calyrex-S damage Blissey and Chansey while also hitting bulky Eternatus harder than Astral Barrage. Trick notably cripples Yveltal — the loss of Heavy-Duty Boots greatly impacts its ability to switch into Calyrex-S — while also crippling Blissey, Chansey, Porygon2, and Tyranitar so Calyrex-S's teammates can exploit them. Aromatherapy allows Calyrex-S to take advantage of the numerous switches that it forces by providing useful team support as a cleric. Alternatively, Nasty Plot gives Calyrex-S a way to boost its damage output after Trick removes its Choice Specs. Choice Specs maximizes Calyrex-S's damage output, notably allowing it to OHKO fast Zacian-C after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p>Calyrex-S fits best on balance teams that appreciate its tremendous firepower and ability to revenge kill Zacian-C and can cover up its weakness to Yveltal. Tyranitar and specially defensive Yveltal make great teammates, soft checking most offensive Yveltal and helping Imposter-proof Calyrex-S. Xerneas and Zacian-C are also great teammates because they heavily pressure both Yveltal and Tyranitar. In return, Calyrex-S heavily threatens their most common check in Necrozma-DM. Offensive Yveltal is also a strong teammate, as it and Calyrex-S share checks in Tyranitar and opposing bulky Yveltal. Thus, each can weaken the other’s checks, allowing either one to sweep late-game. After Calyrex-S uses Trick, Substitute sweepers such as Zekrom and Zygarde-C can set up on a Choice-locked wall. Calyrex-S greatly appreciates Knock Off support from Pokemon like Yveltal, Ferrothorn, and Necrozma-DM in order to force bulky Yveltal to take Stealth Rock damage, putting it in range of a 2HKO from Astral Barrage. Knock Off also reduces the longevity of opposing Tyranitar, Porygon2, and Ho-Oh. Additionally, Stealth Rock support is invaluable, forcing Yveltal lacking Heavy-Duty Boots to take chip damage every time it comes in.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Nasty Plot Calyrex-S is one of the most lethal setup sweepers in AG due to its amazing Special Attack and Speed tier, powerful STAB move in Astral Barrage, and strong ability in As One. It can use Nasty Plot on forced switches from Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM, Zacian-C, and Lunala, giving it better firepower to break through bulky walls such as Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and specially defensive Eternatus if lacking Psyshock. Draining Kiss turns into Max Starfall during Dynamax, letting +2 Calyrex-S OHKO specially defensive Yveltal and OHKO Tyranitar after some chip damage. Baton Pass lets Calyrex-S take advantage of switch-ins such as Yveltal and Tyranitar by pivoting out and passing its Nasty Plot boosts to other special wallbreakers such as Life Orb Yveltal, Xerneas, and Life Orb Eternatus. Substitute stalls out Yveltal's Dynamax turns, blocks Sucker Punch from offensive Yveltal, and potentially stops Ditto from taking advantage of it. Psyshock is an option over Baton Pass, Substitute, or Draining Kiss to nail Blissey and Chansey and more immediately threaten specially defensive Eternatus. Life Orb significantly increases Calyrex-S's damage output, guaranteeing an OHKO on specially defensive Yveltal with +2 Max Starfall and dealing extra damage to bulky walls such as Ho-Oh, Eternatus, and Zygarde-C and offensive threats like Zacian-C and Groudon. Focus Sash is an alternative item to withstand an attack from threats like Ditto, Sucker Punch Yveltal, and Marshadow. However, Calyrex-S then has to be wary of Stealth Rock or Spikes breaking Focus Sash. Heavy-Duty Boots makes Calyrex-S immune to Sticky Web and tougher to wear down compared to Life Orb. It also pairs excellently with Baton Pass. Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Calyrex-S to outspeed Jolly Zacian-C and Speed tie with opposing Calyrex-S.</p> <p>Nasty Plot Calyrex-S's best fit is on bulky offense and hyper offense teams, where it can find the right support to weaken its extremely few checks. Special wallbreakers such as Life Orb Yveltal, Xerneas, and Life Orb Eternatus can benefit from Calyrex-S's Nasty Plot boosts if it's running Baton Pass. Sucker Punch Yveltal is an especially strong partner, as it can prevent Ditto from completely destroying a team once it has copied Calyrex-S, while specially defensive sets can take boosted Astral Barrage and Imposter-proof any sets without Draining Kiss relatively easily. Teammates that can pressure Yveltal and Tyranitar for Calyrex-S such as Zacian-C, Xerneas, Marshadow, and Kyogre are appreciated. On hyper offense teams, Shuckle can provide Sticky Web for Calyrex-S, which allows it to outspeed Choice Scarf Kyogre and other Calyrex-S, while Excadrill is a lead that removes damaging entry hazards and Sticky Web with Rapid Spin, which is especially helpful for Focus Sash Calyrex-S. Regieleki is a useful spinner as well, since it can force out threats like Yveltal and opposing Calyrex-S thanks to its STAB moves and unmatched Speed tier.</p> "

Astral Barrage OHKOes offensive Necrozma-DM and opposing Calyrex-S while heavily damaging Groudon, Zekrom and Zacian-C. Psyshock targets boosted Geomancy Xerneas, defeating it after significant chip, while enabling Calyrex-S to damage key defensive Pokemon such as Blissey and Eternatus. Trick enables Calyrex-S to cripple its best switch-ins such as Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Tyranitar while thwarting major threats such as Dragon Dance Zygarde and Calm Mind Kyogre.

However, Choice Scarf variants of Calyrex-S find it even more difficult to break through the Pokemon's two main switch-ins, Yveltal and Tyranitar, so offensive teammates which can deal with them, such as Zacian-C, Groudon, and Xerneas, are appreciated. In return, Calyrex-S can threaten Necrozma DM for Zacian and Xerneas while crippling pivots such as Ho-Oh and Blissey with Trick for Xerneas. Ferrothorn, Calm Mind Kyogre, and Zygarde are appreciated too for switching into and taking advantage of Yveltal and Tyranitar. In return, Calyrex-S, can clear their status ailments, which can be especially beneficial for offensive Zygarde. Marshadow forces Calyrex-S out, so counterplay such as defensive Zygarde, Eternatus, and pivots such as Ho-Oh is appreciated. Yveltal can Imposter-proof Calyrex-S, preventing Speed ties.</p> "

        "description": "<p>SubSeed Calyrex-S trades in the immediate power behind other offensive sets for a slower-paced wallbreaking set. Calyrex-S is able to very easily sweep unprepared teams with this set, but its lack of coverage and slow pace make it a higher-risk set than most due to its high vulnerability to certain threats such as Yveltal with Snarl and Tyranitar. Its main goal is to use the combination of Substitute + Leech Seed to force normal checks such as Yveltal to use healing moves, in which case it can either use Taunt to prevent them from recovering and continue chipping them down with Astral Barrage or set up with Nasty Plot to aim for a sweep from behind the Substitute. Astral Barrage should only be used against weakened foes or after boosting with Nasty Plot multiple times to conserve Astral Barrage's low PP, and Nasty Plot allows it to break through walls like Eternatus and Ho-Oh after they've been chipped. Leftovers helps to get as much HP back in combination with Leech Seed as possible so it can put up the highest number of Substitutes, and with 52 Defense EVs, its Substitute always survives an uninvested U-turn from Yveltal. Maximum Speed investment ensures that Calyrex-S can outrun Pokemon like Zacian-C naturally.</p> <p>Calyrex-S's natural offensive presence with just Astral Barrage is enough to support a lot of common Pokemon, and if it is successfully able to beat certain checks like Yveltal, it can easily sweep through teams or be very beneficial to its teammates weak to those checks. Zacian-C dislikes cores of Necrozma-DM, Zygarde-C, Lunala, and other physically defensive walls that can chip it down, which Calyrex-S can use to set up fairly well and break through them. Zacian-C also provides a good way of breaking Yveltal, Blissey, and a weakened Ho-Oh, which Calyrex-S greatly appreciates, especially if the opposing Yveltal has coverage to break this set. Many other physical wallbreakers like Swords Dance Groudon and Marshadow can bait in Yveltal wanting to hit them with Foul Play and use their Dynamax to break through Yveltal and other checks, opening up Calyrex-S a lot offensively for a sweep. Calyrex-S can potentially do the same for those Pokemon against Yveltal without ways to break past this set. Yveltal is also a near-required teammate given that this set is fairly susceptible to Ditto if not behind a Substitute, and Yveltal can also provide hazard control and has U-turn to get Calyrex-S in safely.</p> "
