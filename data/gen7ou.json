  "Magnezone": {
    "overview": "<p>Magnezone's near-exclusive access to Magnet Pull gives it a very unique and valuable niche in the OU metagame as a trapper and eliminator of Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Scizor, Skarmory, and Celesteela. It also functions as a solid revenge killer with Choice Scarf, being able to check a number of dangerous Pokemon like Kartana, Mega Scizor, and weakened Celesteela. However, its lackluster Speed stat, even with a Choice Scarf, means that it typically struggles to retain its utility after it has trapped what it aims to trap; it is often forced to take a hit before it can attack with its other sets and doesn't have recovery to offset this damage. Its good set of resistances is somewhat undermined by its weakness to three common types in Ground, Fighting, and Fire, which makes it easy for dangerous Pokemon like Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, and Mega Charizard X to KO and leaves it unable to safely trap Heatran and Excadrill.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Assault Vest is an option if you're desperate for compression, but is often an inferior method of using Magnezone as it needs a lot of power to reliably trap some of the defensive Steel-types and a Choice Scarf to effectively trap Swords Dance Kartana. Chople Berry can be used to check Psychic-type Focus Blast users like Alakazam and Tapu Lele as well as trap the extremely rare fast Superpower Mega Scizor, allowing Magnezone to either eliminate them with one of its attacks or cripple them with Thunder Wave.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Volcarona and Mega Charizard X: Volcarona and Mega Charizard X easily use Magnezone for setup after it traps something. Mega Charizard X resists every move that Magnezone packs, allowing it to set up with ease, whereas Volcarona resists everything other than Magnezone's Electric-type coverage and is extremely dangerous to give setup opportunities due to its very limited counterplay.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types are immune to Thunderbolt and Volt Switch. Landorus-T, Garchomp, Mamoswine, and Excadrill are significantly faster than Magnezone and OHKO with Earthquake, with Excadrill also resisting Flash Cannon. While less common, Gastrodon takes pitiful damage from anything that Magnezone can throw at it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Heatran doesn't appreciate switching into Thunderbolt, but it OHKOes all variants of Magnezone with Magma Storm. Alolan Marowak can potentially carry Lightning Rod, allowing it to take very little damage from any of Magnezone's attacks barring Corkscrew Crash, and can dent Magnezone or one of its teammates with its choice of Shadow Bone, Fire Punch, or, if Rock Head variants can successfully bluff Lightning Rod, Flare Blitz.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Mega Medicham and Keldeo are significantly faster than Magnezone and OHKO with High Jump Kick or Secret Sword. Mega Heracross also achieves an OHKO with Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey takes pathetic damage from anything that Magnezone can throw at it and can use the switch that the Magnezone player is forced to make to utilize any of its support options.</p> ",

        "name": "Substitute Z",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute is mainly intended to take advantage of Celesteela using Protect, but it is also nice for when other Steel-types give Magnezone a free turn or when you are unsure about which attack to choose. Thunderbolt can be used in conjunction with Electrium Z in order to OHKO Pokemon like Celesteela or offensive Heatran after Stealth Rock. Flash Cannon can be used in conjunction with Steelium Z over Electrium Z to get a KO on incoming Landorus-T, Garchomp, Tapu Koko, and Latios with Stealth Rock up. Hidden Power Fire is utilized in order to trap and eliminate Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EVs are straightforward, boosting Magnezone's damage output while making it as fast as possible, allowing Magnezone to outrun Pokemon such as uninvested Landorus-T, Mega Scizor, Suicune, and specially defensive Heatran. A Modest nature is used in order to maximize damage output. This allows Magnezone to always KO offensive Heatran after Stealth Rock and almost always do so against Shift Gear Magearna if using Electrium Z. Additionally, Modest nature assures an OHKO on offensive Landorus-T from full and almost always OHKOes Garchomp, defensive Landorus-T, or Latios after Stealth Rock if using Steelium Z. The only reasons to use Timid are assuring Magnezone outruns bulky Landorus-T and Choice Band Tyranitar, but you lose out on most of the KOs Magnezone gets with Steelium Z and Electrium Z, and Magnezone simply doesn't stay in on these Pokemon unless a Substitute is up, so this is rarely worthwhile. On the topic of the aforementioned items, Steelium Z is used when you do not truly need to OHKO Steel-types like Celesteela and Heatran, and would prefer to enable Magnezone to eliminate incoming offensive pivots. Electrium Z is used when your focus is solely is upon abusing Magnet Pull to the best of Magnezone's ability. An EV spread consisting of 136 HP / 24 Def / 156 SpA / 192 Spe can be run to take a +2 Sucker Punch from Mega Mawile after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>The goals of this set are to eliminate any Steel-type that Magnezone may encounter and do as much damage as possible when not facing a Steel-type. Moreover, utilization of Substitute to make Magnezone less prediction reliant is key, and this should be kept in mind when trying to make the most use of Magnezone in battle. Substitute is also useful when you expect the opponent to use moves such as Protect, Sucker Punch, and Leech Seed. It is best to bring Magnezone into battle when you expect a vulnerable Steel-type like Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, or Celesteela to come in. Alternatively, if they manage to get in, switching Magnezone in to trap them is a good idea if you believe they will stay in.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that abuse the removal of opposing Steel-types, particularly Celesteela, Skarmory, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn, are generally ideal. The best abusers of this tend to be strong physical attackers like Mega Pinsir, Tapu Bulu, Kartana, and Landorus-T. Alternatively, Pokemon that simply do not fare well against Steel-types such as Tapu Lele, Latios, and Mega Diancie can all work well alongside this variant of Magnezone. Finally, if you are using Steelium Z as your item, then you should put specific emphasis on luring in Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor when building. Fire-types like Heatran and Rock-types like Tyranitar or Mega Tyranitar take advantage of this. On the contrary, if you are using Electrium Z, then the same can be said for removal of Celesteela and integrating Pokemon that benefit from it, such as the aforementioned Tapu Lele and Latios, into to your team.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunderbolt is Magnezone's primary STAB move to use against Celesteela and Skarmory. When foes that are resistant or immune to it are eliminated, it can do a decent amount of damage thanks to Magnezone's stellar Special Attack. Hidden Power Fire is very important in disposing Ferrothorn, Kartana, and Mega Scizor. Flash Cannon provides a neutral hit against Ground-types while doing a significant amount of damage to Tyranitar, Tapu Bulu, and Tapu Lele. Volt Switch completes the set to allow Magnezone to keep up momentum provided, of course, it isn't used against an opposing Ground-type. Volt Switch is a great move to use in the event that you predict a foe that resists Electric will switch into Magnezone such as Tangrowth or Mega Venusaur.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Timid nature with a Choice Scarf helps Magnezone reach 360 Speed to outspeed Kartana and everything up to Serperior. 4 HP and 4 Defense EVs allow Magnezone to live an unboosted Sacred Sword from Kartana from full HP after Stealth Rock damage. Magnet Pull is the preferred ability to prevent opposing Steel-types from switching out of Magnezone as well as assisting in fulfilling its role.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Magnezone isn't an excellent revenge killer; however, it should be seen as a Pokemon that can trap and dispose of Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Kartana, and Mega Scizor. There will be circumstances where locking onto Thunderbolt isn't optimal, as it draws in Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. For circumstances such as this, Flash Cannon is the recommended move to lock Magnezone onto. Thanks to Magnezone's solid typing, it can be used in emergency situations to take a hit for its teammates. Magnezone's typing is solid against threats such as Mega Diancie, Tapu Bulu, and Tapu Lele, though be aware of their coverage moves such as Earth Power, Superpower, and Focus Blast, respectively. Magnezone's underwhelming Speed tier does put it to failure against threats such as Greninja, so bear this in mind when seeking out teammates.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Defensive Landorus-T is one of Magnezone's greatest partners. On top of having a Ground-type immunity to switch into Earthquake, Landorus-T has Intimidate and U-turn to help further check opposing Pokemon. In best-case scenarios, defensive Landorus-T can be used in a dire emergency versus Kartana to weaken its Attack with Intimidate, U-turn into Magnezone, and secure Kartana's demise thanks to Magnezone's Magnet Pull. Stealth Rock also draws in Mega Scizor, a common Defog user, onto the field, since Landorus-T has an insignificant threat level against it. Magnezone being slower than threats such as Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Mega Alakazam leaves it and its teammates needing Pokemon that can effectively tackle faster Pokemon without many issues. A great example of a Pokemon that can handle Greninja and Mega Alakazam effectively is Assault Vest Magearna, which has excellent typing and great special bulk while sporting Volt Switch to help with momentum and STAB Fleur Cannon to discourage Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp from switching into it to block Volt Switch. Assault Vest Tangrowth is a solid example that can handle most variants of Greninja and Tapu Koko. Thanks to its pure Grass typing, Tangrowth can also withstand Ground-type attacks aimed at it. Choice Scarf Magnezone does lack a significant amount of power, but trapping Steel-types can help certain breakers create massive dents in the opponent's teams. Kyurem-B and Manaphy greatly appreciate the removal of Ferrothorn and Kartana. Mega Diancie, Latios, Calm Mind Clefable, and Tapu Bulu are Pokemon that support Celesteela and Mega Scizor being eliminated as well.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunderbolt is Magnezone's most reliable STAB move, letting it successfully trap the likes of Celesteela and Skarmory while still hitting walls that don't resist it hard. Hidden Power Fire is key for trapping Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Flash Cannon lets Magnezone heavily punish Ground-type switch-ins, such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor; it also throttles Tapu Bulu, which is usually a solid answer to Electric-types. Finally, Volt Switch lets Magnezone pivot out against Grass-types that can avoid a 2HKO from Flash Cannon, such as Tangrowth, Assault Vest Amoonguss, and Mega Venusaur. Volt Switch can also generate as well as maintain momentum.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Magnet Pull lets Magnezone fulfill its role as a trapper, enabling it to remove and KO the likes of Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, Celesteela, and Skarmory. Choice Specs gives Magnezone immediate power behind its moves, notably taking Celesteela and Ferrothorn down more quickly, as the former could potentially beat Magnezone in a one-on-one situation between Leech Seed and Protect if healthy, whereas the latter could otherwise stack layers of Spikes against it. Maximum investment in Special Attack alongside a Modest nature allows Magnezone to hit as hard as possible, most notably having a chance to 2HKO Tangrowth and Mega Venusaur after Stealth Rock. 252 Speed EVs let it tie with opposing Modest Magnezone while still getting the jump on several important foes, such as Mega Scizor and most Tyranitar. A Timid nature could be used to outrun Landorus-T with little Speed investment and Adamant Tyranitar with maximum Speed investment, but these two are somewhat rare, making the trade-off more often than not suboptimal while losing out on potentially 2HKOing Tangrowth and Mega Venusaur. An EV spread consisting of 136 HP / 24 Def / 156 SpA / 192 Spe can be run to take a +2 Sucker Punch from Mega Mawile after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to put your opponent into a position in which Magnezone can trap the Steel-types it should, namely Celesteela, Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. Switching into Magnezone as you expect them to go into their Steel-type is a solid option; similarly, sacrificing an expendable Pokemon to entry hazards or a predicted attack from one of these Steel-types can let Magnezone come in freely. Magnezone can switch into the likes of Clefable and Ferrothorn without getting punished provided they lack Knock Off, so try to take advantage of these Pokemon to switch Magnezone in. However, be careful not to leave it low on HP. When Magnezone is on the field, opponents could attempt to pivot a Ground-type in to block its Volt Switch; under these scenarios, hitting the likes of Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor with a Choice Specs-boosted Flash Cannon is more often than not the best bet. If your opponent's team lacks a Ground-type or if their Ground-type has already been taken down, spamming Volt Switch can be a great idea on something Magnezone forces out, as it is surprisingly strong after Choice Specs is factored in. After Steel-types have been successfully trapped and removed, Magnezone can act as a regular wallbreaker.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Partners that appreciate certain Steel-types trapped by Magnezone are great choices. Strong Psychic-types such as Mega Alakazam and Mega Latios are arguably two of the Pokemon that benefit the most from Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Celesteela being out of the equation, as Mega Alakazam doesn't appreciate taking a Bullet Punch and has some trouble overcoming Celesteela, while Mega Latios can't really break the aforementioned Pokemon without resorting to Hidden Power Fire for Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn or the very odd Thunderbolt for Celesteela. Kartana also notably appreciates Mega Scizor, Celesteela, and Skarmory getting trapped and KOed, and the same applies to the likes of Mega Pinsir, Tapu Lele, and several others. Pivots that can bring Magnezone in are appreciated, especially those that can bait Steel-types in. For instance, Ash-Greninja can force Ferrothorn in, which gives Magnezone a free switch in, putting a lot of pressure on Ferrothorn's player; of course, Ash-Greninja also appreciates Ferrothorn getting trapped, and Magnezone acts as a decent pivot to most Grass-types that take it on. Clefable is also a solid partner, as it can keep Magnezone healthy with Wish and lure the Steel-types Magnezone likes to trap in, most notably Ferrothorn and Skarmory, as well as Mega Scizor and Celesteela. Knock Off users can remove Skarmory's Shed Shell, allowing Magnezone to trap it.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Mega Gallade is a decent wallbreaker thanks to its high Attack stat paired with its strong STAB moves and useful coverage moves in Knock Off and Ice Punch. Having access to Swords Dance allows Mega Gallade to boost its Attack stat to even higher levels, which can make it difficult for defensive teams to take on. Knock Off is particularly useful for pressuring bulky Psychic-types that other Fighting-types such as Mega Medicham tend to struggle with. Mega Gallade's good Speed tier allows it to outspeed foes such as Kartana, Garchomp, Mega Medicham, and Tapu Lele, giving it an edge against some offensive teams. Its decent bulk, notably in Special Defense, gives it setup opportunities against a majority of defensive Pokemon. It also allows Mega Gallade to take a hit from certain offensive threats in a pinch. Unfortunately, it faces competition from other Fighting-types like Mega Medicham, which doesn't rely on setup in order to beat bulkier teams, and Mega Heracross, which has an easier time against stall teams as well as a more useful defensive typing. Despite the fact that its bulk isn't terrible, Mega Gallade's poor defensive typing means it's still prone to being revenge killed by a bunch of common faster Pokemon such as Tornadus-T as well as most Choice Scarf users; this is especially true after a Defense drop from Close Combat.</p> ",

Unaware Clefable ignores Mega Gallade's boosts and can take any two attacks, but it has to be careful of switching in if entry hazards are up, especially if it lost its item due to Knock Off. Tapu Fini can live a +2 Zen Headbutt from full HP, but it lacks reliable recovery and dislikes losing its item.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Tornadus-T can switch into any attack from Mega Gallade as long as Stealth Rock isn't up and threaten it with Hurricane. Mega Alakazam and Tapu Koko outspeed and threaten Mega Gallade, although they struggle to switch in.

Zen Headbutt is used to beat Pokemon that resist Close Combat like Toxapex, Clefable, and Tapu Fini; it's also the best option against Flying-types such as Tornadus-T and Gliscor if Ice Punch isn't used. Knock Off allows Mega Gallade to beat bulky Psychic-types like Reuniclus, Slowbro, and Mew that would otherwise wall it. Crippling foes by removing their items such as Clefable's Leftovers and Landorus-T's Choice Scarf is also useful in general. Ice Punch targets Flying-types such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Gliscor; it also OHKOes offensive Garchomp without a boost and does more to Mega Latias and Mega Latios than Knock Off.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Justified is used as Gallade's pre-Mega ability, as it can punish Knock Off from weaker foes such as Toxapex and Tangrowth.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Gallade is best used early- to mid-game to break through defensive cores; however, thanks to its solid Speed tier, it can also be used to clean late-game. Be careful when switching it in, as taking too much damage early on can limit its ability to wallbreak. Status conditions, especially paralysis and burn, also limit Mega Gallade's wallbreaking ability, so avoid directly switching it into foes like Rotom-W, Heatran, and Toxapex. It'll also struggle to use Swords Dance safely if it's continuously being worn down. For these reasons, Mega Gallade should be brought in through aggressive switches or VoltTurn support from teammates. Use Swords Dance against weaker defensive Pokemon or on forced switches. It's best to set up if a boost is needed to threaten a defensive switch-in such as Reuniclus or Clefable. If an offensive pivot such as Tornadus-T or Choice Scarf Landorus-T is predicted, hitting them hard with the appropriate move or removing their item with Knock Off is recommended. Knock Off can be spammed early-game against most teams to chip down certain checks and counters, especially since most Pokemon holding a Mega Stone or Z-Crystal won't want to switch in. Mega Gallade's decent Special Defense means it can take attacks like Moonblast from Clefable and Tapu Fini or multiple Ice Beams from Mega Latias and set up against them, trading its health to weaken them for a teammate. Similarly, it can take a hit from offensive foes such as Greninja and Mega Alakazam, sacrificing most of its health to remove or weaken them. However, this should only be done if Mega Gallade's health is no longer needed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Gallade fits best on bulky offense teams with VoltTurn support from Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Assault Vest Magearna, Landorus-T, and Choice Scarf Jirachi. The former two can also switch into Tornadus-T. Other wallbreakers like Swords Dance Garchomp and Landorus-T as well as Choice Band Kartana can weaken physically defensive walls, giving Mega Gallade an easier time cleaning up. The former two also can set up Stealth Rock and pressure common Defog users. Tapu Lele is a particularly useful partner that can assist in wallbreaking while also providing Psychic Terrain to boost Mega Gallade's Zen Headbutt and block priority moves such as Sucker Punch from Mega Mawile and Fake Out from Mega Medicham. Mega Gallade is forced out by Tornadus-T and Mega Alakazam when at low health, so switch-ins to them are necessary. Electric-types such as Rotom-W and Zapdos can switch into Tornadus-T and generate momentum with Volt Switch. Steel-types like Magearna and Celesteela can switch into Mega Alakazam and also take on Fairy-types for Mega Gallade. If not using Knock Off, Mega Gallade struggles to break through bulky Psychic-types. In this case, Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar and Weavile are useful partners. They can also use Pursuit to weaken Tornadus-T.</p> "

  "Heatran": {
    "overview": "<p>Heatran is one of the best Pokemon in the metagame thanks to a variety of different traits. Its typing and really well-rounded stats make it a good check to top threats within the metagame like Magearna, Mega Mawile, Tornadus-T, and Ferrothorn. Additionally, because of Z-Moves, it's hard to consistently keep Heatran in check defensively. For example, it can easily overwhelm checks like Garchomp and Mega Alakazam with Steelium Z as well as Tapu Fini and Rotom-W with Grassium Z. It's an exceptionally useful Stealth Rock setter because it can easily pressure common Defoggers like Tornadus-T and Rotom-W. It can also function as a stallbreaker with the combination of Magma Storm, Toxic, and Taunt, only adding to its overall versatility. However, Heatran's popularity is not entirely positive. Because of how popular it is, Pokemon like Magearna, Tornadus-T, Volcarona, and Tapu Lele, Pokemon that Heatran is supposed to check, often elect to use coverage moves to overwhelm it. In addition to this, Heatran has no reliable recovery, which makes it pretty easy to wear down with entry hazards and even resisted moves like Hurricane over time. Heatran's middling Speed tier also leaves it susceptible to offensive Pokemon like Landorus-T, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Medicham.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Will-O-Wisp can be run instead of Toxic on Firium Z variants to cripple Mega Mawile and Garchomp as well as activate Flash Fire against Mega Sableye teams, but it leaves Heatran completely helpless against Mega Alakazam. Metal Sound allows Heatran to reliably deal with Reuniclus, which can otherwise slowly overwhelm it. It also makes it easy for Heatran to weaken slower Tapu Fini variants. However, it doesn't provide much besides that, so other moves are often preferred. Roar can be run in a few niche circumstances on teams that don't want to give Reuniclus and Substitute Mega Latias free turns to set up with Calm Mind. However, Heatran can't really afford to fit it on its moveset.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Defensive Water-types such as Tapu Fini, Rotom-W, and Slowbro can be hard for Heatran to deal with without Bloom Doom or Toxic. Tapu Fini can also prevent Heatran from crippling grounded Pokemon like Garchomp with Toxic. Offensive Water-types such as Ash-Greninja, Mega Swampert, and Gyarados can also switch into Heatran a few times.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon and Coverage: Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor are capable of forcing Heatran out but struggle to consistently switch in because of the threat of a Z-Move. Pokemon such as Volcarona, Tangrowth, and Mega Charizard X often run Ground-type coverage to deal with Heatran, so it should be wary of switching into them.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Dragon-type Pokemon such as Mega Latios, Mega Latias, and Hydreigon resist Heatran's Fire-type STAB attack and can pressure it with Earthquake or Earth Power or use it as setup bait. They should be wary of Toxic and Corkscrew Crash, though.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar: Tyranitar doesn't mind much from specially defensive Heatran and can pressure it with Earthquake or Pursuit trap it. It should be wary of Z-Move variants, though, because they can easily overwhelm it.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon and Coverage</strong>: Fighting-types such as Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Gallade can easily pressure Heatran with their STAB moves but struggle to switch into it. Some Pokemon like Tapu Lele, Magearna, and Tornadus-T often run Fighting-type coverage to pressure Heatran.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Heatran lacks any form of reliable recovery and has to rely on Leftovers.

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Magma Storm enables Heatran to trap and take out Chansey, Clefable, and Toxapex in combination with Taunt and do passive damage to other switch-ins. It also enables you to switch to a check of the Pokemon that took Magma Storm more reliably as a result of Magma Storm's trapping, which is especially notable with potential targets of a Pursuit partner like Mega Latios and Mega Latias. Lava Plume can be used over Magma Storm to burn switch-ins such as Garchomp, Mega Tyranitar, Toxapex, Mega Latios, and Gliscor before its Toxic Orb has been activated while also having better accuracy and PP at the expense of not being able to trap and KO Pokemon like Chansey, Toxapex, and Clefable. Earth Power allows Heatran to pressure Toxapex after trapping it with Magma Storm while also hitting opposing Heatran, which would otherwise be able to freely switch in and take advantage of it. It also does decent damage to Pokemon like Tyranitar and provides an accurate attack if used with Magma Storm. Protect allows Heatran to gain extra Leftovers recovery, which is important due to its lack of reliable recovery, rack up free Magma Storm damage against switch-ins, safely scout moves from Choice-item Pokemon like Kartana, Tapu Lele, and Greninja, and make High Jump Kick users such as Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny take recoil damage for trying to take Heatran out. Toxic enables Heatran to pressure several of its usual checks, including Mega Alakazam, Garchomp, Mega Latias, Rotom-W, and Gastrodon, as well as other Pokemon like Volcarona and Tornadus-T and works very well in wearing the opponent down in tandem with Magma Storm's residual damage. Heatran is a fantastic Stealth Rock setter due to its bulk, typing, and ability to check Defog users like Tornadus-T, Mega Latias lacking Ground-type coverage, and Zapdos, giving it many opportunities to set it up. Taunt prevents passive Pokemon such as Chansey, Clefable, and Toxapex from healing, making them easier to break past and remove with Magma Storm.</p> <p>76 Speed EVs allow Heatran to outspeed Rotom-W and Mega Mawile while the remaining EVs aid it in checking strong special attackers like Tapu Lele, Magearna, and Tornadus-T. 52 Special Attack EVs can be used to OHKO opposing offensive Heatran with Earth Power. However, this makes Heatran worse at taking on other special attackers, and wearing opposing Heatran down into KO range of Earth Power isn't usually too difficult a task. Heatran should be used as a defensive answer to Pokemon such as Magearna, Ferrothorn, Mega Latias, and Volcarona. However, be cautious of coverage options that can easily break Heatran, such as Hidden Power Ground from Mega Latias and Volcarona or Focus Blast from Magearna. In the early-game, attempt to spread status with Toxic and Lava Plume to wear the opposing team down over time. Should you be running it, set up Stealth Rock on Pokemon that can't badly cripple Heatran, like Kyurem-B lacking Earth Power, Tapu Koko, and Toxapex, as well as on forced switches. Avoid taking unnecessary damage so Heatran can consistently check what it's supposed to throughout the game. This is especially pertinent against bulkier teams since Heatran is unable to trap Pokemon such as Chansey and Toxapex if it's been weakened too much. Be careful when pivoting into Pokemon that run Knock Off, since they're often Pokemon Heatran is meant to check, like Ferrothorn, Tornadus-T, and Tangrowth, because losing Leftovers hurts its longevity.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Defog users such as Tornadus-T, Tapu Fini, Mega Latias, and Gliscor can clear entry hazards to help improve Heatran's longevity. Tornadus-T is able to check and Defog on threatening Fighting- and Ground-types like Gliscor, Mega Lopunny, and Landorus-T, with Heatran pivoting into strong Ice-type moves for it, while Tapu Fini can check the aforementioned Fighting-types as well as Battle Bond Greninja while appreciating Heatran answering Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Ferrothorn. Mega Latias can better answer Kartana, Ground-types, Water-types like Rotom-W, and opposing Heatran while enjoying Heatran checking Fairy-types like Magearna, Tapu Lele, and Mega Mawile. Gliscor can check and Defog on Ground-types, Toxapex, and opposing Heatran while also pivoting into them and spreading Toxic in tandem with Heatran, while Heatran can pivot into Ice- and Grass-type attacks. Bulky Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu and Ferrothorn check common Ground- and Water-types such as Ash-Greninja, Garchomp, and Gliscor as well as Dragon-types like Mega Latios and Mega Latias while enjoying Heatran taking common Ice-, Flying- and Fire-type attacks for them. Tapu Bulu brings Grassy Terrain, which aids in increasing its longevity and enables it to switch into Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Mega Alakazam, and Tapu Lele much more consistently. Ferrothorn is able to provide even more passive damage in tandem with Heatran by setting Spikes, using Leech Seed, and removing foes' Leftovers with Knock Off. Swords Dance Gliscor is a fantastic partner on bulkier teams since it can break through bulky targets like Mega Latias if Heatran spreads status to them. Defensive Water-types such as Toxapex, Rotom-W, and Gastrodon share great defensive synergy with Heatran, checking other Water-types such as Ash-Greninja and Tapu Fini while liking Heatran's ability to pivot into Grass-types. In particular, Toxapex is a great partner due to its ability to switch into Mega Lopunny consistently and spread status with Toxic and Toxic Spikes. Mega Tyranitar can Pursuit trap checks like Mega Latios, Hidden Power Ground Mega Latias, and Reuniclus if Heatran lacks Taunt while also bringing sandstorm, which further wears down foes in tandem with Heatran's Magma Storm and Toxic; additionally, its ability to run Stealth Rock frees up a moveslot on Heatran. Weavile can also Pursuit trap these targets and Knock Off bulky Pokemon's Leftovers, but lacks Tyranitar's sandstorm and ability to get up Stealth Rock. Both of them benefit from Heatran pivoting into Fairy-types like Clefable, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Koko.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Magma Storm enables Heatran to trap passive Pokemon like Toxapex while attaining nice chip damage on checks such as Garchomp. If Heatran is running Solar Beam, Magma Storm should always be used instead of Lava Plume to ensure that Pokemon like Tapu Fini can't scout for Bloom Doom. Alternatively, Lava Plume can be run to cripple common Pokemon like Rotom-W and Garchomp. Earth Power lets Heatran hit opposing Heatran and overwhelm Toxapex. Flash Cannon hits checks such as Mega Alakazam, Garchomp, Tyranitar, and Mega Latios for good damage. However, Corkscrew Crash is the main appeal to using Flash Cannon, allowing Heatran to outright OHKO said checks. Alternatively, Solar Beam should be run alongside Grassium Z to overwhelm Water-type checks such as Tapu Fini and Rotom-W. It also lets Heatran OHKO Pokemon like Mega Alakazam and Garchomp under Grassy Terrain. Because of Heatran's great matchup against many Defoggers and passive Pokemon in general, it's a great Stealth Rock user. If Heatran's team already has another Stealth Rock user, Taunt can be run alongside Magma Storm to overwhelm passive Pokemon like Chansey.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>4 Defense EVs allow Heatran to take a +2 Sucker Punch from Mega Mawile from full health. A Modest nature is preferred to improve damage rolls against Garchomp and Gliscor. Heatran can also elect to use Firium Z to OHKO Tangrowth while overwhelming checks like Mega Sableye. Running Firium Z also leaves Heatran with room to run Toxic.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Because opponents are likely to scout for Z-Moves from Heatran once they don't see Leftovers, you should make sure not to immediately use the Z-Move against checks like Mega Alakazam and Mega Latios. Rather, you should lure them into a fake sense of security and then use Heatran's Z-Move when they switch a target in. For similar reasons, don't reveal Flash Cannon too early. In a similar vein, you should make sure to trap Pokemon like Tapu Fini and Rotom-W to ensure that they are KOed by Bloom Doom. Early-game, Heatran should aim to set up Stealth Rock and weaken checks with Magma Storm. Magma Storm especially helps with positioning yourself, as it prevents the foe from switching out. Don't use it too frequently early on though because of its poor PP. Also, despite Heatran's very respectable bulk, you should not repeatedly send it into attacks from Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Magearna because it is worn down quickly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Other Steel-types such as Magearna and Celesteela are really important to run with Heatran, as it is unable to check Psychic-types like Mega Alakazam and Tapu Lele defensively. Grass-types in general form an amazing defensive core with Grassium Z Heatran. Most notably, they can check Ground- and Water-types such as Garchomp and Ash-Greninja. Tapu Bulu deserves a special mention because it provides Heatran with a bit of recovery and can boost the power behind its Bloom Doom thanks to Grassy Terrain, which makes it nearly impossible to switch into Heatran. Entry hazards limit the amount of times that Heatran can switch into play, so hazard removal from the likes of Tornadus-T and Rotom-W is appreciated.</p> "

  "Hawlucha": {
    "overview": "<p>Hawlucha is a very threatening sweeper with the combination of a terrain seed such as Electric Seed, Grassy Seed, or Psychic Seed and the Unburden ability, capable of outspeeding even extremely fast foes, such as all common Choice Scarf users, Mega Alakazam, and sweepers such as Shift Gear Magearna and Mega Swampert. Additionally, it can threaten out many defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, and Mega Venusaur by virtue of its offensive typing. Hawlucha is also able to setup on defensive variants of Landorus-T, which is found on nearly every team. Its relatively low base Attack leaves it unable to OHKO foes such as Latios without a Swords Dance boost and even more defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Mew after a Swords Dance boost. It is also prone to being revenge killed by strong priority moves, such as Mega Pinsir's Quick Attack or Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Stone Edge is an option to hit Zapdos, but doesn't offer much outside of that. Misty Seed can also be run if Hawlucha is paired with Tapu Fini, but generally the other Island Guardians provide better synergy with Hawlucha and are more effective in the metagame. A 252 Atk / 252 Spe spread can be used for teams weak against opposing Hawlucha, but the lack of bulk makes it a lot tougher for it to set up.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Priority Users: Ash-Greninja, Weavile, and Mega Pinsir can revenge kill Hawlucha by negating its Unburden boost through their priority. However, Hawlucha's Defense boost from Electric or Grassy Seed reduces the damage taken by the latter two, whereas Psychic Seed allows a better matchup with the former. Still, none of the three can outright OHKO Hawlucha.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Pokemon like Zapdos, Mew, Clefable, and Celesteela can take hits from Hawlucha and wear it down with status moves, such as Will-O-Wisp and Leech Seed, or super effective attacks. Note that Clefable fails to OHKO Hawlucha with Moonblast, however.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pokemon that resist Fighting-type Moves: Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Flyinium Z Landorus-T can avoid the OHKO from +2 Hawlucha's attacks and OHKO it in return. However, entry hazards can quickly wear down the former into range of a +2 High Jump Kick.</p> ",

Because of the fact that Hawlucha's Electric Seed is used immediately after switching into Electric Terrain, Acrobatics's Base Power is instantly doubled. Swords Dance boosts Hawlucha's Attack stat, allowing it to OHKO foes such as Mega Swampert, Tapu Lele, and Shift Gear Magearna. Roost helps Hawlucha setup on Pokemon such as defensive Landorus-T and Celesteela thanks to its defensive boost with Electric Seed. Drain Punch offers reliable Fighting-type STAB and helps sustain Hawlucha's sweep by keeping it healthy. Substitute is an option to dodge status moves such as Leech Seed and Toxic.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A terrain seed in conjunction with Unburden instantly doubles Hawlucha's Speed stat if it is brought into the correct terrain; Electric Seed should be used alongside Tapu Koko, Grassy Seed alongside Tapu Bulu, and lastly Psychic Seed alongside Tapu Lele. Additionally, the Defense boost it receives is helpful for allowing Hawlucha to set up Swords Dance more easily, whereas Psychic Seed offers an interesting twist that boosts Hawlucha's Special Defense one stage instead, allowing Hawlucha to take on Hidden Power Ice from Landorus-T as well as Water Shuriken from Ash-Greninja much more easily. Maximum Attack is used so Hawlucha hits as hard as possible, and 124 Speed EVs help it outspeed all Pokemon up to Jolly Sand Rush Excadrill. 96 HP EVs, along with 36 SpD EVs, enable Hawlucha to survive a Moonblast from Clefable and 2HKO it with Acrobactics. Such investment is unecessary if Hawlucha is running a Psychic Seed though, leaving the SpD EV points to be invested onto HP. A bulkier spread of 104 HP / 244 Atk / 88 SpD / 72 Spe and an Adamant nature can be used on Electric or Grassy Seed Substitute variants to set up on Toxapex.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Hawlucha works best as a late-game sweeper, aiming to break through teams once defensive threats such as Landorus-T, Mew, and Toxapex have been eliminated or sufficiently weakened. It is necessary to preserve Hawlucha's Terrain Seed until this time because otherwise, Hawlucha will lack the speed necessary to outrun offensive Pokemon. The Defense boost granted by Electric or Grassy Seed improve's Hawlucha's matchup against physical attackers, such as Tapu Bulu, whereas Psychic Seed's Special Defense increase ensures a better matchup against Ash-Greninja, Landorus-T and Clefable. Hawlucha can use these boosts to its bulk to set up Swords Dance before breaking through the opposing team with its STAB moves.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tapu Koko is a mandatory teammate for Electric Seed variants because it can reliably set up Electric Terrain. Shuca Berry variants of Tapu Koko provide the most support for Hawlucha but mostly any Tapu Koko set is fair game. Similarly, Tapu Bulu can be paired with Grassy Seed sets, being an effective defensive glue with the advantages of preventing Ash-Greninja from evolving and possibly being able to lure Zapdos with Stone Edge. Finally, Tapu Lele pairs with Hawlucha holding a Psychic Seed, and it can take down most physical walls that roadblock Hawlucha's path to a sweep. Spikes users can provide Hawlucha with chip damage, assisting its sweeping capabilities. Ferrothorn and Ash-Greninja are prime options. Ground-types, including Landorus-T and Garchomp, also have good offensive synergy with Hawlucha. Rockium Z or Smack Down variants of Landorus-T in particular help Hawlucha against stall teams. Swift Swim users like Kingdra and Mega Swampert in conjunction with Pelipper also synergize well with Hawlucha because they can break walls that Hawlucha struggles with, like Landorus-T, and vice versa, such as Assault Vest Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth.</p> "

  "Avalugg": {
    "overview": "<p>Avalugg is a niche pick as a physical wall for bulkier archetypes such as stall. Its massive physical bulk allows it to stomach hits from pretty much any physical attacker that lacks super effective coverage to hit it, including physically oriented Gliscor, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Mawile lacking Iron Head. Rapid Spin also enables it to be a situational entry hazard remover, as it can switch into setters such as Landorus-T and Mega Swampert and spin their Stealth Rock away while they're forced out. Furthermore, Sturdy allows it to act as a last resort if Avalugg is at full health and a certain wallbreaker runs out of control, enabling it to tank a hit and fire back with a decently powerful Avalanche. Nonetheless, its defensive typing is possibly one of the worst in the game, allowing many physical attackers, such as Swords Dance Kartana, Swords Dance Mega Scizor, Tyranitar, and Mega Medicham, to overcome Avalugg without much struggle. Said typing also leaves it prone to being worn down by hazards, mostly Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes. Avalugg's Special Defense is also very lackluster, leaving pretty much any special attacker able to break through it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Roar can be used over either Rapid Spin or Toxic to phaze setup sweepers; nonetheless, both Rapid Spin and Toxic are very important for Avalugg, and Roar is just a lot more situational than both moves. Leftovers is an option over Rocky Helmet to benefit from the passive recovery it gives, but Rocky Helmet is usually more valuable to chip away physical attackers and help Avalugg KO them with a boosted Avalanche.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Special Attackers</strong>: Thanks to Avalugg's poor Special Defense stat, nearly any special attacker in the tier can take it down. Examples include Heatran, Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Hoopa-U.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage: Physical attackers with strong super effective coverage can also take Avalugg down; Mega Medicham, Kartana, and Tyranitar are notable examples.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Avalugg is easily pressured by residual damage, most notably entry hazards. Stealth Rock strips a fourth of Avalugg's health, leaving it prone to being taken down by Pokemon it's supposed to check, such as Kyurem-B and Mega Pinsir. Toxic Spikes is also very detrimental, as being poisoned really makes Avalugg a lot less consistent on walling what it should. In general, entry hazards also break its Sturdy, removing its ability to act as a last-ditch effort to stop a wallbreaker. Burn and sand damage also greatly hinder Avalugg, making it less consistent when checking what it needs to.</p> ",

Its added effect of increasing power when Avalugg is hit by a move also makes it surprisingly strong in tandem with Avalugg's considerable Attack stat. Recover is important to keep Avalugg healthy and let it continually check what it needs to. Rapid Spin may seem counterintuitive on an Ice-type, but it allows Avalugg to switch into entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T and Mega Swampert as they set up their hazards and spin them away as the aforementioned Ground-types switch out. Earthquake allows Avalugg to deal with Mega Mawile lacking Iron Head, and can also be useful to catch troublesome Pokemon such as Heatran looking to take advantage of Avalugg. Lastly, Toxic can be used and gives Avalugg the possibility to threaten foes outside of Avalanche, allowing it to beat Kyurem-B, for example.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Rocky Helmet is run to gradually wear down physical attackers such as Mega Mawile and Landorus-T. Sturdy enables a last-ditch hit on an out-of-control wallbreaker if Avalugg is at full health. 88 Attack EVs allow Avalanche to OHKO Mega Pinsir.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Avalugg acts as a switch-in for some physical attackers such as Gliscor, Mega Pinsir, and certain Mega Mawile sets. However, watch out for entry hazards when switching it in, as the likes of Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes can wear it down quickly. Avalugg should also be switched into Stealth Rock setters it can beat, such as Landorus-T and Mega Swampert, removing their hazards while not getting damaged by them. If a wallbreaker is a threat to Avalugg's team and it can be taken down by a 120-Base Power-Avalanche, it might be smart to keep Avalugg at full HP for it to be able to make use of its Sturdy ability and act as a last-resort-countermeasure against said wallbreaker. The likes of Tapu Lele, Hoopa-U, and Kartana take a considerable amount of damage from Avalanche and thus can be taken down by the aforementioned method after some slight prior damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Despite having Rapid Spin on its own, entry hazard removal partners are important for Avalugg. Avalugg prefers to only use Rapid Spin situationally, leaving the role of a reliable hazard remover to teammates. Mega Sableye is a great option thanks to its Magic Bounce ability; Defog users such as Zapdos and Gliscor also fit the bill very well. Walls capable of taking on special attackers, namely Chansey and Jirachi, are great options to cover the multitude of special attackers that can take Avalugg down. Similarly, walls that have great defensive synergy with Avalugg, such as Toxapex, Quagsire, and the aforementioned Zapdos, can cover Avalugg's weaknesses. Overall, Avalugg's narrow niche makes it only viable on stall and semi-stall and thus leaves it with only a handful of teammates to work with, as such archetypes are rather formulaic by nature.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Tapu Koko is one of the best offensive pivots in the tier due to its Speed tier combined with its versatility and frightening power in Electric Terrain. Access to U-turn and Volt Switch allows Tapu Koko to pivot into teammates and generate momentum throughout the game. Tapu Koko has a solid movepool for its role, including access to utility options like Roost, Taunt, and dual screens, which increases its versatility in addition to its adequate selection of coverage moves. Tapu Koko's resistances to Dark and Flying coupled with access to Roost allows it to check some of the more problematic Pokemon in the tier, most notably Tornadus-T. However, Tapu Koko's underwhelming offensive stats make its coverage moves much weaker than its STAB moves, so bulky Pokemon that resist Electric are severely problematic from a defensive standpoint. Additionally, Tapu Koko's mediocre bulk means that it will take significant damage from any decently strong neutral attack, especially special ones.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Tapu Koko can utilize a dual screens set on hyper offensive teams with setup sweepers, but these teams are quite niche and are often ineffective. Tapu Koko can use Calm Mind in conjunction with Fairium Z to function as a pretty scary wincon against bulky offense and balance teams, but it's generally much less consistent than other sets, as the set doesn't have room for a pivoting move. Tapu Koko can also run a physically based Choice Scarf set to revenge kill offensive threats, most notably Volcarona and Mega Alakazam, but it's very reliant on prediction to be effective and is much weaker than the Choice Specs set. Toxic can be used over Hidden Power Ice on the pivot set on rain teams, as it allows Tapu Koko to cripple checks like Gastrodon and Tangrowth for teammates, but the inability to hit Ground-types is very noticeable. Finally, Defog can be used on the pivot set due to Tapu Koko's ability to force out Toxapex and remove its Toxic Spikes, but it's important to note that it's very difficult to make room for it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon: Bulky Grass-types, such as Ferrothorn and Assault Vest Tangrowth, are very strong checks for Tapu Koko due to their natural bulk in conjunction with their resistance to Thunderbolt, but it must be noted that Ferrothorn has to be wary of a potential Hidden Power Fire. Offensive Grass-types, such as Choice Scarf Kartana and Choice Scarf Serperior, can also threaten out Tapu Koko with the threat of outspeeding it and either heavily damaging or KOing it with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon: Ground-types, such as Landorus-T and Garchomp, exert an immense amount of pressure on Tapu Koko, particularly the Choice Specs set, due to their ability to prevent Tapu Koko from spamming Volt Switch. However, it must be noted that neither of the aforementioned Ground-types can switch into Hidden Power Ice very well. On the other hand, Ground-types that are not weak to Hidden Power Ice, such as Gastrodon and Excadrill, are much more consistent answers to Tapu Koko, but it must be noted that offensive Excadrill sets can be worn down over time by U-turn in conjunction with entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Specially defensive walls, such as Assault Vest Magearna and Chansey can switch into most Tapu Koko sets fairly comfortably and threaten it out with strong STAB attacks and status moves. However, these Pokemon can be taken down by the Z-Wild Charge set.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure: Faster offensive Pokemon such as Mega Alakazam and Mega Lopunny can come in against Tapu Koko with the help of U-turn and Volt Switch support and dispatch it fairly easily, but they cannot switch directly into Tapu Koko.

  "Tapu Lele": {
    "overview": "<p>Tapu Lele easily sets itself apart from a jungle of powerful wallbreakers in OU due to its unique ability: Psychic Surge. Said ability sets Psychic Terrain automatically, boosting Tapu Lele's Psychic-type attacks for free and making them wickedly difficult to tank or switch into directly. The Terrain also protects grounded Pokémon from priority attacks; as many priority users such as Mega Mawile, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Scizor rely on their respective attacks to stop faster threats, Tapu Lele can limit their actions and allow itself or teammates to completely overpower these threats. With these traits combined with great offensive stats and a good typing, Tapu Lele is a frightening force of nature, capable of utterly breaking numerous team archetypes while boasting unique threat coverage along with downright scary flexibility in its item and set usage. However, Tapu Lele dislikes the fact that many bulky Steel-types, especially Magearna and Celesteela, can easily switch into both of its STAB attacks. The coverage attacks it usually runs to address them as well as other checks and counters tend to be too weak or shaky to use consistently without fair prediction or prior damage. Tapu Lele's average physical bulk and good—but not fantastic—Speed also tend to hold it back, making it often vulnerable to revenge killing. Regardless, as Tapu Lele is always rather unforgiving in its power and versatility, all team archetypes must exercise caution against it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Tapu Lele can use an Electric-type attack of choice to inflict more solid damage on Celesteela specifically—Psychic Terrain-boosted attacks will usually do more damage to Water- and Flying-types except Skarmory. In particular, a combination of Electrium Z and Thunder becomes Tapu Lele's best attack against specially defensive Celesteela, KOing it after a bit of prior damage. Thunderbolt is a more reliable move should the user choose to use another item. Nature's Madness in tandem with a Tapunium Z can also be used to severely weaken would-be checks Magearna and Jirachi. Similarly, other Z-Crystals such as Ghostium Z can be used to lure in and take out specific checks and counters. The Choice Specs set can alternatively use either Focus Blast or Thunderbolt, as the former inflicts more damage on Heatran and the latter on Celesteela; however, Psychic already inflicts a notable amount of damage on Heatran and doesn't suffer from inaccuracy while Thunderbolt is limited to hitting Celesteela for super effective damage.</p> <p>The next best alternative is Substitute, which takes advantage of switches Tapu Lele commonly forces. Behind the safety of a Substitute, Tapu Lele can hit its next switch-in hard and generally have an easier time predicting and adapting to situations. Finally, Tapu Lele can simply opt to run an all-out attacker set with four attacks, though that fourth coverage attack will usually prove situational over a utility move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-type Pokemon and Coverage: Although Tapu Lele usually runs coverage like Hidden Power Fire and Focus Blast to get past Steel-types, such attacks are too weak or unreliable to be used constantly or get locked into from a Choice item. Assault Vest Magearna and Jirachi are a couple of Tapu Lele's more solid checks under this category, as they easily switch into any attack except Choice Specs-boosted Hidden Power Fire—which they don't appreciate but can easily tank at reasonable health—while KOing back with Steel-type STAB attacks. Specially defensive Celesteela is a very solid counter to Tapu Lele, as it can tank every commonly used attack except for the odd Thunder and can apply pressure by using Leech Seed or Heavy Slam. As long as Tapu Lele isn't locked into or lacks Hidden Power Fire, Mega Scizor can switch in easily and Roost off damage while wearing Tapu Lele down with U-turn or Pursuit. If Tapu Lele lacks any one of Hidden Power Fire, Focus Blast, or All-Out Pummeling, the likes of Ferrothorn and Heatran also switch into it rather easily, though they all risk being worn down due to a lack of reliable recovery and take major damage from a boosted Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Speed-based Revenge Killing: Tapu Lele's Speed and bulk are only slightly above average, making it easily susceptible to standard revenge killing. Note that priority attacks will not work due to Psychic Terrain being active the majority of the time. If Tapu Lele is not holding a Choice Scarf itself, a variety of faster Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Kartana, Greninja, Mega Alakazam, and Tapu Koko can pick it off at slightly high percents. Even the Choice Scarf set has some problems due to being locked into a single move, as well as still being outrun by faster Choice Scarf users such as Greninja and Kartana.</p> <p><strong>Miscellaneous Specially Defensive Pokemon: Being locked into the wrong attack or lacking Psyshock means some particularly specially defensive Pokemon can afford to switch in on Tapu Lele rather confidently, though many of them are hindered significantly by Taunt if fighting against the Taunt + Three Attacks set. Chansey and Cresselia are prime examples, as they mind nothing else from Tapu Lele except Psyshock and Shadow Ball, respectively. Specially defensive Gastrodon cannot be 2HKOed by non-boosted Psychic and can use Toxic and Recover until Psychic Terrain expires. Similarly, Clefable can utilize Wish and Protect to stall out Psychic Terrain turns, though physically defensive variants are still pressured hard by Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: As Tapu Lele will be wanting to serve as a juggernaut with its Psychic-type attacks most of the time, healthy Dark-types simply prevent it from doing so, especially if it's locked into a move by a Choice item. Using Dark-types should only be a last resort, however; save Alolan Muk, many will simply be decimated by well-timed Moonblasts on the switch. Weavile and both formes of Greninja are notable, as they outspeed non-Choice Scarf sets and can easily take advantage of Tapu Lele locked into Psychic or Psyshock by hitting it or a switch-in extremely hard. Thanks to a Special Defense buff from sandstorm, most healthy, bulkier variants of Tyranitar will eat up a Moonblast while taking all other attacks except Focus Blast pretty well. It can then proceed to wear Tapu Lele down with Pursuit or its other STAB moves. Similarly, Hoopa-U is bulky enough to switch into Choice-locked coverage attacks and Psychic-type attacks if desperately needed.</p> ",

      {
        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Psychic deals an insane amount of damage to even the most semi-bulky of resistant targets; 252 HP Heatran, for instance, gets 2HKOed with one layer of Spikes or equivalent prior damage. Dark- and Psychic-types daring enough to try switching into Psychic are maimed by a STAB Moonblast instead, which also has great Base Power and general coverage. Though running two parallel Psychic-type attacks on the same set may seem redundant, Psyshock is an integral attack in the third slot for its ability to break physically frail Pokemon; for example, it beats Chansey and specially defensive Gastrodon while making dents in Assault Vest Magearna and defensive Celesteela. Hidden Power Fire cleanly OHKOes Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, preventing either from responding with an attack or recovery move. It also picks off Skarmory, Mega Mawile, Excadrill, and Magnezone at higher percents while being a sufficient option against Jirachi. Alternatively, Focus Blast can be used to OHKO Heatran at the expense of losing out on a strong hit on Mega Scizor.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Significant investment in Speed and Special Attack gives Tapu Lele as much Speed and raw power as possible. A Timid nature is the preferred choice over Modest the majority of the time because positive-natured offensive Landorus-T and Excadrill are relatively common in the metagame, and the chance to outrun neutral-natured foes such as Modest Mega Charizard Y is valuable. With Choice Specs, Tapu Lele achieves enormous power by receiving a great boost to its already impressive STAB moves, as well as gaining boosts to its otherwise average coverage attacks.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Though this set sports terrifying nuking power that can let it potentially tear through threats early- or mid-game, it is important to ascertain its worth in a match depending on the opposing team structure. In particular, this set breaks balanced teams almost completely, as Tapu Lele is fast and powerful enough to overwhelm typical defensive Pokemon while limiting frailer offensive targets' opportunities to switch in. Still, this set should typically be played cautiously, as these archetypes can adapt to unfavorable situations with more bulky or resistant units. Against offensive teams with usually fast and defensively average Pokemon, Tapu Lele can typically exert pressure with Psychic and Moonblast all day until it eventually faints; in such cases, it has probably amassed more than enough damage for fellow cleaners to come in.</p> <p>It is generally not advised to switch in Tapu Lele too aggressively because it is a fantastic offensive asset against nearly all team archetypes. Due to Choice Specs locking Tapu Lele in a single move, prediction should be exercised against opponents with multiple resistant or immune Pokemon. For instance, seeing a Dark-type or two in Team Preview means using Moonblast is the safer choice over Psychic early-game. Likewise, otherwise good switch-ins such as Celesteela and Jirachi can have a chunk of their health taken off with Hidden Power Fire.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Though Tapu Lele can break through most threats with the correct coverage move and prediction, it would rather have the ease of choosing its STAB moves instead of its weaker and unreliable coverage attacks. Tapu Lele is also easy to check due to its only decent Speed and its being locked into one attack, so at least some support against Dark- and Steel-types makes things easier. For example, Magnezone traps and KOes most Steel-types that love switching into Tapu Lele, including Ferrothorn, Celesteela, Jirachi, and Scizor.</p> <p>In general, U-turn and Volt Switch users are good teammates to get Tapu Lele in the field safely—slower ones are especially valued because they are typically bulky enough to take hits and provide further ease in prediction. Defensive Landorus-T is exemplary of this, as it also blanket checks most physical attackers and Steel-types thanks to Intimidate while providing Stealth Rock support. Likewise, Mega Scizor and Rotom-W can also provide a slower U-turn or Volt Switch while keeping several of Tapu Lele's checks and counters in check, especially Celesteela in the case of Rotom-W. Tapu Koko is also worth consideration, as its fast offensive sets threaten a variety of checks and counters to Tapu Lele, including Celesteela and Greninja. Both Tapu Lele and Tapu Koko can also reset each other's Terrains to prevent each other's from expiring at inconvenient times. Since Tapu Lele applies a great deal of pressure and tends to force switches, entry hazard setters can further assist in breaking down switch-ins and defensive Pokemon. Ferrothorn is good in this respect, since it can run either Stealth Rock or Spikes while owning other pros, including fantastic defenses as well as Leech Seed and Iron Barbs to wear down the opposition. Greninja is a more offensive choice that can lay Spikes and be offensively tailored depending on team needs. For instance, a physically offensive version with Protean and Low Kick can lure in and nearly 2HKO Celesteela, while Ash-Greninja has the option of utterly decimating offensive teams when Tapu Lele is through and done.</p> <p>In terms of teammates that benefit from Psychic Terrain in particular, Mega Medicham enjoys the extra power for its own Zen Headbutt as well as Tapu Lele's ability to break through defensive checks and counters, allowing Medicham to clean up when appropriate. Though regular and Mega Alakazam are rather redundant with Tapu Lele because they run similar coverage moves, both also benefit from Psychic Terrain's powering up their Psychic-type moves and preventing priority from hitting. Regular Alakazam can use Focus Sash and Counter to revenge kill any physical attacker, while Mega Alakazam boasts higher offensive stats as well as the ability to revenge kill Sand Rush Excadrill and other weather sweepers thanks to Trace. Other usually priority-weak sweepers such as Volcarona and the aforementioned Ash-Greninja also benefit from Psychic Terrain; however, in practice, they only have a couple of turns to make good use of the Terrain unless Tapu Lele faints the same turn one of them is sent in.</p> "

        "name": "Fightinium Z",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Psychic is preferred on Fightinium Z variants for the added power and reliability against physically defensive walls. However, Psyshock is also a plausible option with Psychium Z, as it targets most notably Chansey and enables Tapu Lele to have a better matchup against stall teams and Assault Vest Magearna in conjunction with Calm Mind. Moonblast is yet another STAB move and hits Dark-types without the need of risking missing Focus Blast, as well as Psychic-types such as Mega Latias, Mew, Mega Latios, and Reuniclus. Focus Blast targets the Steel-types that annoy Tapu Lele such as Heatran and Ferrothorn. It can be boosted into All-Out Pummeling alongside Fightinium Z, which even neutral targets such as Celesteela, Magearna, Mega Scizor, and Jirachi can drop to after previous damage and at +1. Calm Mind enables Tapu Lele to be much more of a nuisance to bulkier teams and most importantly stall, letting it take care of the likes of Chansey and most importantly Mega Aggron.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Fightinium Z is the preferred Z-Crystal, as it gives Tapu Lele a far easier time against the likes of Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor while still being slightly stronger than Psychic against most Fighting-neutral Steel-types. Psychium Z, on the other hand, gives Tapu Lele more leeway to run Psyshock, as Shattered Psyche targets foes' Special Defense, and it does only slightly less damage than All-Out Pummeling on to the likes of Magearna and Celesteela. However, giving up Fightinium Z means Tapu Lele isn't breaking past Mega Aggron stall as easily, and it will have a harder time against Heatran and Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Before using Calm Mind in vain, try to weaken would-be targets so that they're in range of +1 All-Out Pummeling. This obviously doesn't apply to Heatran and Ferrothorn, but the likes of Celesteela, Magearna, and Jirachi need plenty of prior damage to drop, so try to weaken them and prevent the former two from recovering as much as you can. On a similar note, be careful around Protect from Celesteela and Jirachi, as they can use it to burn up your Z-Move and preferably switch out if you're expecting a Protect. The same thing applies for Psychium Z variants, but they need extra effort to break past Heatran and Ferrothorn and can't overcome specially defensive Jirachi at all. Tapu Lele can set up on Pokemon it forces out such as slower physical walls and wallbreakers as well as passive Pokemon that don't really threaten it, such as Toxapex lacking Toxic, Clefable without Thunder Wave, and Mega Latias without Thunder Wave. Against more offensive teams, though, Tapu Lele find little room to set up, so often just throwing attacks and an eventual Z-Move to weaken the likes of Assault Vest Magearna and Choice Scarf Jirachi might be ideal. Avoid letting Tapu Lele get inflicted by Toxic, especially against semi-stall and stall teams, as it makes Tapu Lele a lot easier to play around.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Teammates that appreciate Tapu Lele weakening the opposing team's Steel-types are greatly appreciated. Mega Alakazam is a notable example—especially Knock Off Mega Alakazam—as it also makes great use of Psychic Terrain, making it a lot easier to get past Magearna and Celesteela. Other teammates like Magearna, Kartana, Greninja, and Mega Mawile also fulfill a similar role of pressuring Steel-types. When building with Tapu Lele, keep in mind you also provide Psychic Terrain for your opponent, so having sturdier backbones to the likes of Mega Medicham and Mega Alakazam are extremely important. For Mega Medicham, having a defensive core such as Tapu Fini + Tornadus-T greatly helps to ensure your team is safe against it. For Mega Alakazam, sturdier checks like Assault Vest Magearna or Celesteela should do the trick. Magnezone can rid Tapu Lele of Celesteela, Mega Scizor, and even weaken Assault Vest Magearna a bit if need be; however, Magnezone pairs better with Psychium Z variants, as Fightinium Z can usually overwhelm Steel-types alongside another breaker. Spikes from teammates such as both Greninja formes and Ferrothorn are always welcomed too, as they help wearing down Magearna and Jirachi. Lastly, pivots such as Landorus-T, Assault Vest Magearna, Tornadus-T, and Rotom-W pair well with Tapu Lele, as it appreciates the momentum they provide.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Psychic is Tapu Lele's strongest attack, capable of KOing many common fast, offensive Pokemon and doing a chunk to Pokemon that resist it. Moonblast is a strong alternative attack to fall back on in case the opposing team has Dark-types or healthy Psychic-types. Hidden Power Fire is a passably sufficient weapon against Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Mawile, which like to switch in otherwise thanks to this set's lack of boosted power. Thunderbolt is a good coverage attack, allowing this set to slay regular Gyarados in a single hit and Mantine in two (other moves can only 3HKO it while it stalls with Roost). Thunderbolt also pressures cores that rely on multiple Electric-weak Pokemon, such as Greninja + Toxapex or Celesteela + Tapu Fini. Nature's Madness can be run to punish Pokemon that switch into Tapu Lele for free otherwise, such as Assault Vest Magearna and Celesteela. As a quick note, Psyshock is not very useful on this set, as it barely scratches physically weaker targets such as Chansey without a boosting item. Thus, this set prefers the raw power of Psychic.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximized Speed and Special Attack investment with a Timid nature is simply straightforward for a Choice Scarf set, enabling Tapu Lele to safely revenge kill Mega Alakazam, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and anything slower.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>With the increased Speed provided by Choice Scarf as well as superb natural special offense, Tapu Lele can act as both a revenge killer and a cleaner. Depending on the opposing team, it may be wise to preserve Tapu Lele to do either later in the match. Be careful about simply pressing Psychic if the opponent has healthy Dark- and Steel-types active. In this case, use coverage moves to KO or wear such targets down on the switch. Even without a boosting item, Tapu Lele still has marginally enough power to wallbreak on rare occasions, in which case you can utilize it to weaken foes.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tapu Lele will be cleaning up and revenge killing, so teammates that can weaken Psychic- and Fairy-resistant or immune Pokemon make it much easier for Tapu Lele to spam Psychic and Moonblast without resorting to weaker or inaccurate coverage attacks. Heatran, for instance, instantly threatens and checks a majority of Steel-types with its Substitute or Z-Move sets. A specialized solution is to use Magnezone, which traps pesky Steel-types that tend to switch into Tapu Lele's STAB moves. Toxapex can be a good partner on more balanced teams, as it typically handles some faster threats that Tapu Lele cannot revenge kill itself, such as Mega Charizard X and Kingdra. Mantine is also notable for being able to stop Volcarona, which Tapu Lele cannot outrun at +1, in its tracks while providing a good blanket check against other special threats.</p> <p>Tapu Lele tends to force switches, and since this set is rather lacking in power outside of Psychic, entry hazard support is necessary to pressure and wear down the opposition. The aforementioned Heatran, Ferrothorn, Greninja, and Landorus-T are examples of Pokemon that fit on a wide variety of offensive or balance teams and can set up either Stealth Rock or Spikes. Though Shuckle is rather specialized, it deserves mention for also setting Sticky Web, allowing Tapu Lele and its teammates to pressure and beat threats they could not trump before, such as Choice Scarf Nihilego and +1 Volcarona. To further apply offensive pressure, wallbreakers are greatly helpful; Hoopa-U is a prime example due to benefiting from Psychic Terrain while sporting a colorful and unpredictable array of attacks to whittle down Tapu Lele's checks and counters.</p> "

  "Tapu Bulu": {
    "overview": "<p>Tapu Bulu is capable of checking prominent threats in the OU tier like Gliscor, Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Mega Alakazam thanks to its typing and well-rounded bulk. Solid recovery options in Synthesis, Horn Leech, and Grassy Terrain make Tapu Bulu incredibly hard to wear down. Grassy Surge offers vital team support by powering up Grass-type attacks, weakening Ground-type moves, and providing grounded Pokemon with passive recovery. Tapu Bulu's incredibly strong Grass-type moves turn it into a devastating wallbreaker capable of breaking through many Grass-resistant foes such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos. However, Tapu Bulu's middling Speed tier leaves a lot to be desired, as it is outsped by threatening Pokemon like Heatran and Hoopa-U. Furthermore, the popularity of Steel-types that aren't weak to Superpower such as Celesteela and Mega Scizor as well as defensive Grass-types like Tangrowth and Mega Venusaur hurt Tapu Bulu's offensive capabilities.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Tapu Bulu could utilize Leech Seed on its specially defensive set to wear down Celesteela; however, it often prefers more consistent recovery like Synthesis.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Heatran, Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Volcarona can outspeed Tapu Bulu, 4x resist its STAB attacks, and can respond with a super effective STAB Fire-type attack. They must watch out for Superpower in the case of Heatran or Stone Edge in the case of Mega Charizard Y and X, but otherwise they are strong offensive checks.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Zapdos and Tornadus-T must watch out for Stone Edge, but they can switch in on Tapu Bulu's attacks and threaten it out with a super effective Heat Wave in the case of Zapdos or a STAB Hurricane in the case of Tornadus-T. Tornadus-T also can take advantage of the momentum it gets from forcing out Tapu Bulu with U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: While all must watch for All-Out Pummeling and Choice Band-boosted Superpower, Mega Scizor, Skarmory, and Celesteela can take Tapu Bulu's STAB moves with ease and heal off the damage. Celesteela can either throw out a strong Heavy Slam or set up Autotomize and threaten Tapu Bulu with Supersonic Skystrike. Mega Scizor can Defog on Choice-locked variants or set up Swords Dance and threaten out Tapu Bulu. Skarmory specifically must take care, as it can still lose to Swords Dance variants without Brave Bird, Iron Head, or Whirlwind.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types: If Tapu Bulu lacks Megahorn, Rocky Helmet Tangrowth is a strong answer to it, as it can remove its Choice item with Knock Off or hit it with the rare Sludge Bomb. Mega Venusaur must watch out for Choice Band-boosted Megahorn and Zen Headbutt, but defensive variants can easily stomach Tapu Bulu's hits and respond with a 4x super effective STAB Sludge Bomb. Amoonguss, while not as bulky as Mega Venusaur, still deals with Tapu Bulu in a similar fashion while being able to repeatedly switch into its attacks due to Regenerator.</p> ",

      {
        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Wood Hammer and Horn Leech provide two very different roles for Tapu Bulu. The former packs a massive punch at the cost of some recoil damage that's often somewhat mitigated by Grassy Terrain, whereas the latter is used when Tapu Bulu is low on HP to get some health back and still does some respectable damage on even Pokemon resistant to it like Tornadus-T and Mega Mawile. Superpower is instrumental as Tapu Bulu's main weapon against Steel-types. It deals massive damage to the likes of Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Kartana and hits Celesteela and Jirachi for slightly less damage than Wood Hammer, without taking recoil. Stone Edge is preferred in the last slot to hit Pokemon doubly resistant to Grass-type moves like Volcarona and both Mega Charizard formes on the switch while hitting Tornadus-T without recoil and still acting as Tapu Bulu's best bet against Zapdos. Megahorn is an option that targets the ever common Tangrowth while still hitting Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur hard enough. Zen Headbutt is also an option for the aforementioned Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur as well as Mega Heracross and Buzzwole, but missing out on Tangrowth makes Megahorn far superior.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Band bestows Tapu Bulu with even more power behind its moves, which lets it blow past switch-ins such as Tornadus-T and Magearna. The HP investment allows Tapu Bulu to always avoid a 2HKO from Ash-Greninja prior to transformation after Stealth Rock. Meanwhile, the Speed investment allows Tapu Bulu to get the jump on the likes of Tyranitar and Crawdaunt. The remainder of EVs are pooled into Attack.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Prediction isn't usually too necessary with Choice Band Tapu Bulu. Spamming Tapu Bulu's Grass-type STAB moves is often the right step, with Horn Leech to get some HP back and Wood Hammer for a strong hit on the likes of Tornadus-T and Tangrowth. However, occasionally catching incoming Grass-resistant Pokemon is pivotal for the fate of a match. Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Kartana get a free opportunity to come in if Tapu Bulu uses either Grass-type STAB move; ergo, nailing them with Superpower is surely smart, as the former can set up entry hazards, whereas the latter two can land a powerful blow on Tapu Bulu's team. On the other hand, Volcarona and both Mega Charizard formes are pretty free to switch into Horn Leech or Wood Hammer, so catching them with a Stone Edge doesn't make Tapu Bulu setup bait. Try to keep up momentum with double switches to not let the likes of Mega Heracross and Mega Mawile in for free. Lastly, Tapu Bulu can pivot into offensive Pokemon whose STAB combo it walls, such as Ash-Greninja, Keldeo, and Crawdaunt. It can also switch in on predicted resisted hits, like Tapu Lele's Focus Blast, for example. However, Tapu Bulu should be mindful of Hydro Pump rolls from Ash-Greninja after more than a layer of Spikes, a Scald burn from Keldeo, or a Knock Off from Crawdaunt. As a rule of thumb, letting Tapu Bulu get worn down isn't the best of ideas in most matches, but trading might be useful in some situations.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Magnezone is a stellar teammate, as it rids the opposing team of troublesome Pokemon such as Kartana, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor. Another outstanding teammate is Kartana, especially Choice Scarf Kartana, as it immensely appreciates Grassy Terrain increasing the power of its Leaf Blade, allowing Choice Scarf variants to have an easier time sweeping. Choice Band and Z-Move Kartana could potentially work, but they do have quite some overlap with Tapu Bulu itself as a Grass-type wallbreaker. Ash-Greninja is a threat that every team needs to cover, but without investment in Special Defense, Tapu Bulu is far from a reliable check, so another check such as Assault Vest Magearna, Toxapex, or Tapu Fini is strongly recommended. Entry hazards really help Tapu Bulu wallbreak by chipping at would-be switch-ins. Stealth Rock setters such as Garchomp, Heatran, and Gliscor are formidable teammates, and Spikes from Ash-Greninja is very welcomed too.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance boosts Tapu Bulu's Attack by two stages, allowing it to break past passive Pokemon such as Clefable and Reuniclus. Bulk Up can be run to take on Pokemon such as Mega Mawile and Celesteela safer. Horn Leech is the STAB attack of choice, having a respectable damage output under Grassy Terrain and providing Tapu Bulu with an additional means of recovery. Superpower has good offensive coverage alongside Horn Leech and allows Tapu Bulu to break past Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn. Synthesis lets Tapu Bulu take advantage of its bulk and restore its HP against Pokemon it forces out, such as Landorus-T and Clefable. Protect can be run to gain additional recovery to effectively deal with Mega Alakazam, and to scout moves from Choice Scarf users like Greninja. Wood Hammer can be used alongside Grassium Z if a stronger attack is wanted; however, this leaves Tapu Bulu without a reliable form of recovery. Stone Edge is useful for hitting Flying- and Fire-types like Tornadus-T and Volcarona harder; however, it has little utility outside of that.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP EVs and 252 Special Defense EVs coupled with a Careful nature allow Tapu Bulu to survive strong super effective hits such as Heatran's Magma Storm and Tornadus-T's Hurricane from full health after Stealth Rock damage. Leftovers provides passive recovery and keeps Tapu Bulu healthy alongside Grassy Terrain. Grassium Z can also be used without Wood Hammer to OHKO defensive Pokemon like Clefable, Gliscor, and Reuniclus after a Swords Dance. If Tapu Bulu's team is weak to Adamant Crawdaunt, 96 Speed EVs can be run on Tapu Bulu to outspeed it. Alternatively, if maximum offensive firepower is desired, a spread consisting of 252 Attack EVs and 252 Speed EVs with an Adamant nature can be utilized, but it significantly cuts down on Tapu Bulu's bulk and utility and makes it harder to set up.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Tapu Bulu's defensive typing to pivot into dangerous attackers that it can generally check, such as Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Garchomp. Tapu Bulu forces many switches when it comes in against Pokemon it beats one-on-one, such as Clefable, Choice Scarf and defensive Landorus-T, and Ash-Greninja. Take advantage of these opportunities to set up a Swords Dance or recover Tapu Bulu's health with Synthesis. If the opponent has a bulky Steel-type that doesn't mind Grass- or Fighting-type moves, such as Mega Scizor or Celesteela, recovering Tapu Bulu's health or double switching accordingly is recommended to keep momentum, as Tapu Bulu is hard walled by these Pokemon. Don't hesitate to take a hit from Heatran and Tornadus-T if it means removing them from the game, as Tapu Bulu can stomach a hit from them and recover its HP later on in the game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Water-types, such as Gastrodon and Toxapex, can handle problematic Fire-types like Heatran and Volcarona. Toxapex deserves a special mention because it can reliably handle Mega Scizor and poison Flying-types like Tornadus-T and Zapdos. In return, Grassy Terrain weakens Ground-type moves for Toxapex. Heatran is a phenomenal teammate for Tapu Bulu due to their perfect defensive type synergy. Grassy Terrain also weakens Ground-type moves for Heatran and Tapu Bulu absorbs Water-type attacks from the likes of Ash-Greninja and Keldeo rather easily; however, it should be wary of being burned by Scald. Tyranitar also benefits from Grassy Terrain and can trap Mega Latios and Mega Latias, which can be problematic for Tapu Bulu due to their versatile movepools. Kartana forms a powerful Grass-type spam core with Tapu Bulu, hitting hard under Grassy Terrain with Leaf Blade due to its huge base Attack.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance turns Tapu Bulu into a frightening wallbreaker, allowing it to beat Pokemon like Celesteela, Magearna, and Tangrowth. Although Horn Leech is held back by its low Base Power, it provides Tapu Bulu with vital recovery. Superpower provides Tapu Bulu with coverage for Steel-types like Heatran, Kartana, and Ferrothorn. Stone Edge hits Flying-types such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos, as well as Fire-types like Volcarona and Mega Charizard X. Wood Hammer is an option over Stone Edge that, together with Grassium Z, gives Tapu Bulu an extremely powerful nuke capable of KOing even Grass-resistant Pokemon such as Mega Latias, Magearna, and Assault Vest Tangrowth.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given HP and Special Defense investment allows Tapu Bulu to avoid being 2HKOed by Hydro Pump from Choice Specs Ash-Greninja. 96 Speed EVs enable Tapu Bulu to outspeed Crawdaunt and uninvested Rotom-W, while the rest of the EVs are pooled into Attack alongside an Adamant nature. This in combination with Fightinium Z notably allows Tapu Bulu to OHKO Steel-types such as Magearna, Celesteela, Mega Scizor, and Mega Mawile at +2 with All-Out Pummeling. Rockium Z is an alternative option that allows Tapu Bulu to defeat bulky Grass-resistant Pokemon such as Mega Latias and Zapdos, while still targetting Celesteela. It also helps with bulky Tornadus-T variants. Grassium Z is an option that should be run with Wood Hammer, granting Tapu Bulu a very strong move capable of KOing Pokemon such as Magearna and Tangrowth at +2. However, it doesn't help Tapu Bulu with beating Celesteela.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>You should attempt to bring Tapu Bulu in on Pokemon that it can force out, such as Ash-Greninja, Tapu Fini, and Garchomp. Be wary of Tapu Bulu's health, though, as it can quickly be worn down due to its lack of reliable recovery, especially if running Wood Hammer. Once you have brought Tapu Bulu into play, you should attempt to set up with Swords Dance, as opponents will often attempt to check Tapu Bulu with Steel-types, which it can break past at +2. However, it is worth considering using Superpower, Stone Edge, or Continental Crush instead of setting up with Swords Dance if the opponent has a Pokemon like Heatran, Kartana, Tornadus-T, or Volcarona.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that can struggle to deal with Steel-types, such as Mega Latias, appreciate Tapu Bulu's ability to lure them and take them out. Tapu Bulu struggles to take on Pokemon such as Mega Latias and Mega Latios, and even Tornadus-T can be annoying at times despite Stone Edge, so it's a good idea to pair Tapu Bulu with a Pursuit trapper such as Tyranitar or Weavile. Because of its lack of reliable recovery, Tapu Bulu can struggle to consistently check Ash-Greninja. As a result, it's very important to use another, more consistent check, such as Toxapex, Tapu Fini, or Kommo-o.</p> "

Superpower allows Tapu Bulu to hit Grass-type switch-ins like Heatran, Kartana, and Magnezone. Stone Edge lets Tapu Bulu catch switch-ins such as Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Volcarona.

It can make for a surprise Choice Scarf user, so use this to your advantage. Be careful with Grassy Terrain's healing mechanics giving away that Tapu Bulu is faster than opposing Pokemon. Grassy Terrain's useful role compression is backed up by Tapu Bulu's adequate defensive typing and bulk, which let it take some hits, such as Ash-Greninja's Hydro Pump, but not too well. Because this is a more offensively oriented set, Tapu Bulu should not be relied upon as a switch-in to potent attackers like Ash-Greninja, Mega Swampert, and Mega Alakazam. Do not let Tapu Bulu get freely burned or paralyzed, as these status conditions will heavily hamper Tapu Bulu in its role as a revenge killer.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Tapu Bulu can surprise offensive threats that otherwise would be able to KO it with ease such as Weavile and Tornadus-T. Pokemon such as Mega Medicham that can take advantage of offensive threats being eliminated appreciate this. Tapu Bulu's Grassy Terrain can provide some defensive utility to teammates. Heatran and Magnezone support Tapu Bulu by taking care of Steel-types, while Tapu Bulu returns them the favor via Grassy Terrain, softening blows from Earthquake and restoring their health. Grassy Terrain can also be used to boost teammates' Grass-type attacks such as Heatran's Bloom Doom and Kartana's Leaf Blade. An additional and more reliable check to Ash-Greninja is needed, as with entry hazards and chip damage, Tapu Bulu will lose the ability to take hits from it over time.</p> "

  "Tapu Fini": {
    "overview": "<p>The main standout to Tapu Fini's niche is the fact that it is a Defog user that beats the two arguably best entry hazard setters in the tier in Heatran and Ash-Greninja while still having a decent matchup against other Stealth Rock users like Landorus-T, Mega Tyranitar, Gliscor, and Mega Diancie. Tapu Fini also acts as a decent check to the likes of Hawlucha and Keldeo. Misty Terrain is also incredibly helpful, keeping teammates safe from status, with some notable examples being keeping Mega Mawile protected from Will-O-Wisp and bulky Volcarona safe from Toxic. Taunt is also a wonderful move to have, enabling Tapu Fini to shut down the likes of Toxapex and Reuniclus. However, the lack of reliable recovery is still very crippling to Tapu Fini, meaning it's prone to getting worn down over the course of a match, especially if it has to check more than one Pokemon on the opposing team. This in turn means Tapu Fini will often need teammates as backup checks to what it's meant to check. By extension, that also means Tapu Fini hates getting its item removed, as Leftovers is its sole form of recovery, which means it even goes as far to demand a Knock Off resistance as a teammate. Additionally, the nature of its set means Tapu Fini is forced to pick two out of Moonblast, Scald, and Nature's Madness, which naturally hinders its matchup against some Pokemon it's supposed to check. Lastly, Tapu Fini also faces some competition from other Water-types like Toxapex thanks to the rather narrow niche it fills, and it also dislikes the prevalence of Grass-types like Tapu Bulu, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss, which it can't do much against.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Surf can be picked over Scald for a higher damage output, especially against specially defensive Heatran, but Scald's chance to burn the likes of Tapu Bulu and Landorus-T is usually too good to pass up.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: The likes of Tapu Bulu, Kartana, and Serperior all demolish Tapu Fini with their respective Grass-type STAB moves. That being said, Tapu Bulu risks a burn when switching into Scald.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types and Coverage: Tapu Koko packs a punch even with Defog sets, and it can support allies like Kyurem-B, Mega Mawile, Magearna, and Mega Medicham with their respective Electric-type coverage and U-turn support. Even without Tapu Koko support, the aforementioned Pokemon still pose a threat. Zapdos, Magnezone, and other Electric-types can also pose a big threat to Tapu Fini.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Having the role of a Defogger means Tapu Fini will often have to switch into entry hazards to remove them, which can weaken it considerably, and it's weak to all four of them. Magma Storm chip damage and just being forced to switch into the likes of Heatran and Ash-Greninja without reliable recovery can leave Tapu Fini fairly weakened.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers: Several wallbreakers can overpower Tapu Fini. Choice Specs Tapu Lele hits absurdly hard, Garchomp at +2 knocks Tapu Fini out with Continental Crush, Flyinium Z Tornadus-T can do some massive damage, Mega Alakazam does a lot with Psychic and can use Recover after any of Tapu Fini's attacks, and so on.</p> ",

      {
        "name": "Defog",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Moonblast gives Tapu Fini an edge against Ash-Greninja and Hawlucha, while also allowing it to chunk Dragon-types like Mega Latios, Hydreigon, and Kyurem. Scald is instrumental for the Heatran matchup, but it's also very helpful to potentially punish Tapu Bulu with a burn and give Tapu Fini a better matchup against Landorus-T, Stealth Rock Gliscor, and Mega Mawile. However, Surf or Hydro Pump can be used to nail specially defensive Gliscor, which can Roost off Scalds. Nature's Madness cripples several Pokemon that Tapu Fini wouldn't leave a scratch on otherwise. It's extremely helpful for the Toxapex matchup alongside Taunt, and it's also amazing against Pokemon like Assault Vest Magearna and Ferrothorn that lack reliable recovery; however, missing out on either of Tapu Fini's STAB moves is far from desirable. In case Ash-Greninja and Hawlucha are already covered by other partners, Scald can be run alongside Nature's Madness, forfeiting Moonblast. Taunt enables Tapu Fini to shut down passive Pokemon like Toxapex and Clefable and prevents entry hazard setters from continually setting up Stealth Rock or Spikes. If desired, Taunt can be dropped in favor of Nature's Madness as well. Defog plays a big role in Tapu Fini's niche, enabling it to remove hazards from several setters but most notably those of Ash-Greninja, Heatran, and Landorus-T. Knock Off is another useful option to remove Assault Vest from Magearna and Tangrowth and other miscellaneous items like Toxapex's Black Sludge; however, other choices are often preferred.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>192 Speed EVs are preferred to get the jump on Modest Heatran, Timid Magearna, and anything slower. Variants without Scald may opt for 68 Speed EVs to outspeed Adamant Tyranitar instead and put the remaining EVs into Special Defense for a better matchup against Ash-Greninja. 12 Special Attack EVs enable Tapu Fini to always 2HKO offensive Heatran with Scald, which is unnecessary on variants without Scald. 16 Defense EVs allow Tapu Fini to stomach a +2 Acrobatics from Hawlucha after Stealth Rock and a round of Leftovers, which is not needed on variants lacking Moonblast. Lastly, the remaining EVs are pooled into Special Defense alongside a Calm nature for Tapu Fini to better take on the likes of Ash-Greninja and Heatran.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Tapu Fini's goal is to switch into Pokemon it checks like Ash-Greninja and Heatran and remove their entry hazards. However, try to scout if you're dealing with Ash-Greninja or its Protean counterpart, as Tapu Fini won't appreciate a Gunk Shot. Likewise, be a bit careful with the uncommon Steelium Z Heatran and, if possible, attempt to bait the Corkscrew Crash with a Steel-resistant Pokemon. Tapu Fini lacks reliable recovery, so its health should be preserved to check what it needs. If it checks more than one Pokemon on the opposing team, try to pivot into other teammates occasionally to prevent Tapu Fini from getting so weakened by one Pokemon it would check that it gets KOed by another. Try to position Misty Terrain in your favor. Teammates like Mega Mawile and Mega Medicham could appreciate a temporary immunity to burn, whereas the likes of Volcarona and Mega Charizard X could use a Toxic immunity to get setup opportunities. Be mindful of Misty Terrain weakening Dragon-type moves for the latter if you pack them, though.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Bulky Volcarona is a wonderful teammate, as it mandates Defog support to shine and Tapu Fini provides it. Tapu Fini also handles Toxapex and Heatran pretty well, which is nice for Volcarona. Offensive variants are great teammates as well. In a similar fashion, Mega Charizard X greatly appreciates the Defog support and handles Grass-types for Tapu Fini, but be careful of Misty Terrain weakening its Dragon-type moves. Ferrothorn is a great teammate, as together they act as a strong backbone that the likes of Ash-Greninja, Tapu Lele, and rain teams really struggle to break through. Tapu Fini handles Heatran, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Heracross for Ferrothorn, whereas Ferrothorn covers the likes of Calm Mind Clefable, Magearna lacking Focus Blast, and Tapu Koko. Likewise, Tangrowth and Celesteela offer a similar synergy and appreciate Tapu Fini's Defog as well. Jirachi is also notable, since it can pass Wishes to Tapu Fini and take on Magearna and threatening Psychic-types, whereas Tapu Fini covers Ash-Greninja and Heatran. Pokemon that make good use of Misty Terrain like Mega Mawile, Mega Medicham, and the aforementioned Volcarona are also solid choices. Finally, Gliscor is a great teammate, as it acts as a secondary Heatran switch-in, can provide Stealth Rock, and soft checks threats like Mega Mawile, while Tapu Fini handles threats like Ash-Greninja.</p> "

  "Venusaur": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Venusaur's great physical and special bulk, key resistances to prominent types like Water, Electric, Grass, and Fairy, and ability Thick Fat to take away two weaknesses render it a great defensive check to a number of the best Pokemon in the tier. More specifically, it is able to switch into and beat almost every variant of Mega Mawile, Tapu Bulu, and Magearna and check Kartana and Tapu Koko very handily. It can also take advantage of a lot of more passive defensive Pokemon, such as Ferrothorn, Tapu Fini, and Tangrowth. Mega Venusaur's Poison typing allows it to remove Toxic Spikes on entry, making it a valuable addition to teams weak to them. It is able to differentiate itself from Amoonguss with Thick Fat, which enables it to take moves like Ice Beam from Magearna and Fire Fang from Mega Mawile comfortably, much bigger immediate bulk, and significantly better offensive presence. However, Amoonguss has access to Regenerator, can hold an item, and doesn't take up the team's Mega slot, giving it a decent niche over Mega Venusaur. While it is a good Water-type answer, it is not a reliable Choice Specs Greninja switch-in on its own, as Dark Pulse does too much for Mega Venusaur to check it consistently; thus, it requires a different one besides itself. While Mega Venusaur's typing is fantastic defensively, wallbreakers that can exploit said typing like Tornadus-T, Mega Alakazam, and Tapu Lele pose a huge threat to it. Furthermore, its main form of reliable recovery, Synthesis, has a measly 8 PP, meaning Mega Venusaur cannot last deep into late-game without outside support, especially since it can be forced into awkward situations where it is forced to use Synthesis more often than it'd like. Its recovery is also lowered to 25% by both rain and sand, reducing its otherwise high effectiveness against those archetypes.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Deviating from the main set is generally not advised; however, some alternatives are available if absolutely required. Earthquake can be used over Hidden Power Fire if Magnezone is used alongside Mega Venusaur as a different way of dealing with Mega Mawile and Magearna along with hitting Heatran. Giga Drain is Mega Venusaur's best option for an offensive Grass-type STAB attack but doesn't function nearly as effectively as other options and should be avoided unless absolutely needed. Sleep Powder and Knock Off are both semi-viable alternatives to Leech Seed; however, they are extremely fringe and should not be considered in the very vast majority of cases.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Psychic-types: With the exception of Reuniclus, most Psychic-types like Mega Alakazam and Tapu Lele can't directly switch into Mega Venusaur, but they can take advantage of it after getting in through double switches and U-turn or Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Tornadus-T dislikes being poisoned by Sludge Bomb; however, due to Regenerator, it can get away with it and put pressure on Mega Venusaur. Gliscor completely walls Mega Venusaur and can use it as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Strong Fire-types: Heatran, both Charizard Mega Evolutions, Volcarona, and even Victini can muscle through Venusaur despite Thick Fat.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage: Due to its lack of consistent long-term healing, Mega Venusaur is quite prone to being chipped down, especially through entry hazards, and can be put into scenarios where it can no longer check what it's supposed to.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: Tyranitar prevents Mega Venusaur's Synthesis from healing it any significant amount, rendering it significantly harder to use, can Pursuit trap it, and doesn't fear Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Reuniclus</strong>: Reuniclus is able to ignore Leech Seed and Sludge Bomb poisoning thanks to Magic Guard while taking insignificant damage from the latter, meaning it can freely use Mega Venusaur as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Toxapex</strong>: While not being able to touch it directly outside of burning it with Scald, Toxapex completely walls Mega Venusaur and has access to Regenerator, coming out of their exchange ahead quite comfortably.</p> ",

        "name": "Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Leech Seed allows Mega Venusaur to keep itself healthy throughout the game without relying on Synthesis's small number of PP. It works great on forced switches, allowing Mega Venusaur to beat Mega Mawile and Magearna with a lot more ease, gradually chip its checks, and avoid being entirely passive while healing, helping its teammates in the process. Mega Venusaur is also able to deter the Grass-types that would be able to absorb it otherwise thanks to Sludge Bomb and Hidden Power Fire. Sludge Bomb is its strongest option against the Fairy-types it checks so well like Clefable and the Island Guardians. Its 30% chance of poisoning also disrupts checks like Tornadus-T and Tyranitar. Hidden Power Fire is required in order to beat Steel-types like Mega Mawile, Magearna, Celesteela, Kartana, and Mega Scizor and prevent Ferrothorn from getting free turns to set up Spikes against Mega Venusaur.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Chlorophyll is chosen as the pre-Mega ability for the rare case of sun being present, as Overgrow is entirely useless; this set does not carry a Grass-type move. The EV spread listed allows Venusaur to survive two Dark Pulses from Choice Specs Greninja after Stealth Rock while outspeeding maximum Speed Mega Mawile. The rest is dumped into Defense to make Mega Venusaur a worthwhile Mega Mawile, Kartana, and Tapu Bulu check.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Venusaur appreciates being brought in safely through doubles and U-turn or Volt Switch in order to threaten the opposition with Leech Seed and Sludge Bomb. Despite this, it's very capable of switching into a large number of attacks and shrugging them off, such as Mega Mawile's Play Rough, Tapu Bulu's Horn Leech, Kartana's Leaf Blade, and Magearna's Fleur Cannon. However, Mega Venusaur is much more limited in recovery compared to defensive walls like Toxapex due to Synthesis's low PP; it should not be brought in on powerful attacks repeatedly, as it can be overwhelmed. For this reason, Mega Venusaur should be wary of switching into entry hazards, and accordingly, try to limit or remove them as much as possible. Mega Venusaur should attempt to use Leech Seed and Sludge Bomb as often as possible, as those moves provide the greatest results, both immediately and long-term. Using Leech Seed often will help both Mega Venusaur itself and its teammates, as it will allow Mega Venusaur to prolong its life without relying on Synthesis but also alleviate pressure for a teammate switching into Heatran or Tornadus-T, and Sludge Bomb poisoning Tornadus-T makes Mega Venusaur's life much easier. Hidden Power Fire should be used on Mega Mawile, Magearna, and Celesteela after they have already been hit by Leech Seed as well as on Ferrothorn and Kartana. Synthesis should only be used when Mega Venusaur absolutely requires the instant healing burst, as it kills momentum for the user and has very limited use due to its low PP.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Celesteela is arguably Mega Venusaur's most effective partner; it can switch into Pokemon Mega Venusaur cannot deal with, such as Tornadus-T, Mega Alakazam, and Tapu Lele while Venusaur itself deals with Pokemon Celesteela hates facing, such as Tangrowth and Zapdos. It also helps pressure their mutual checks, like Heatran, and alleviate pressure off Mega Venusaur for checking Kartana and Tapu Bulu. Tapu Fini is an excellent entry hazard remover and Heatran check and provides another Ash-Greninja check. Conversely, Mega Venusaur checks Grass-types like Kartana and Electric-types like Tapu Koko for it. Tornadus-T is another great entry hazard remover for Mega Venusaur. It can also get Mega Venusaur in for free on Celesteela, Mega Mawile, Tapu Koko, and Magearna, while both Tornadus-T and Mega Venusaur pressure Heatran. Rotom-W can use Defog for Mega Venusaur, switch into Heatran and Tornadus-T, and pressure common checks like Toxapex. It also provides a secondary Water-type answer, albeit not an Ash-Greninja check. Defensive Magearna variants like Assault Vest and Heart Swap can switch into and check Tornadus-T, Tapu Lele, Mega Alakazam, and Ash-Greninja, helping Mega Venusaur perform its role more easily. They also pressure Heatran and can bring Mega Venusaur in safely through Volt Switch. Swords Dance Garchomp is a strong Heatran check and a good Fire-type answer and can take advantage of Toxapex, Tapu Lele, and Tornadus-T while providing Stealth Rock utility to the team.</p> "

    "overview": "<h1>Mega Charizard X</h1> <p>Mega Charizard X is an extremely strong wallbreaker and setup sweeper that can offensively pressure key Steel- and Grass-types such as Magearna, Ferrothorn, and Tangrowth. Its great offensive typing after Mega Evolving and strong STAB options boosted by Tough Claws allow it to break past most of the metagame with near-unresisted STAB and coverage options. Mega Charizard X's good Speed tier enables it to outpace fast foes such as Tapu Lele, Kyurem-B, and Gliscor, giving it the edge over other slower wallbreakers. Access to Dragon Dance makes Mega Charizard X extremely threatening after a boost, outspeeding even some Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T. However, it is extremely susceptible to entry hazards; before Charizard Mega Evolves, it is 4x weak to Stealth Rock and struggles to effectively switch in, and after Mega Evolving it becomes vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards. Furthermore, it is also chipped down by residual damage like Rocky Helmet from Tornadus-T and Iron Barbs from Ferrothorn as well as taking substantial Flare Blitz recoil to deal with these foes, which limits its ability to break these Pokemon without being worn down into range of faster attackers or priority itself.</p> <h1>Mega Charizard Y</h1> <p>Mega Charizard Y is able to use Drought and its high Special Attack stat to become a fierce wallbreaker. Access to Solar Beam allows it to muscle through bulky Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Rotom-Wash, while Focus Blast hits Heatran and Tyranitar for a ton of damage. Unfortunately, Mega Charizard Y has no way of breaking through Toxapex, one of the most commonly used Pokemon on balance, as well as Chansey. Its massive Stealth Rock weakness limits its opportunities to switch in, and its average Speed stat leaves it prone to being revenge killed by common offensive Pokemon such as Garchomp, Tapu Koko, and Mega Diancie.</p> ",

Substitute can be used to help ensure safe setup against status users and eliminate 50-50s around Landorus-T's Intimidate. Outrage can be run instead of Dragon Claw to 2HKO stall staples such as Quagsire and Pyukumuku, but having to lock itself into it to hit Pokemon like Garchomp is often undesirable for Mega Charizard X. Will-O-Wisp can be run to cripple potential switch-ins such as Tyranitar and Landorus-T. Toxic can also be run to ease Mega Charizard X's matchup against stall and to be able to break through bulky Water-types like Quagsire and Pyukumuku without having to lock itself into Outrage in the long run. Swords Dance and Flame Charge can be used alongside Dragon Claw and Earthquake. Swords Dance allows Mega Charizard X to overcome Toxapex and Tapu Fini more easily with Earthquake, while Flame Charge still offers a Speed boost with modest enough power to help Mega Charizard X from being walled by Celesteela and Skarmory.</p> <h1>Mega Charizard Y</h1> <p>If Mega Charizard Y's team has solid answers to Tyranitar and Heatran, Hidden Power Ice can be used instead of Focus Blast to surprise common answers such as Landorus-T and Garchomp.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Mega Charizard X</h1> <p><strong>Rock-types and Stealth Rock: Prior to Mega Evolving, Charizard is 4x weak to Stealth Rock and is heavily crippled by switching in; after Mega Evolving, it is still weakened by the entry hazard.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Mega Charizard X's best way to hit Heatran and Toxapex, and it can significantly damage Rock-types like Mega Diancie and Tyranitar. It also provides a way to hit Ground-weak Steel-types such as Magearna and Magnezone without suffering from recoil damage. Roost is run over a third coverage option to allow Mega Charizard X to recover HP that it loses from Flare Blitz recoil or switching into Stealth Rock. This allows Mega Charizard X to more consistently check Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu, Kartana, and Serperior. However, on more offensively geared teams, Roost can be foregone for Dragon Claw; Dragon Claw still 2HKOes specially defensive Toxapex and hits important targets like Rotom-W, Garchomp, and Mega Latias. It also has better neutral coverage in general. Neither Dragon Claw nor Outrage should be run if Tapu Fini is on Mega Charizard X's team.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Jolly nature enables Mega Charizard X to outspeed Tapu Lele, Kyurem-B, and Hydreigon. Running Blaze as Charizard's pre-Mega ability prevents it from being damaged by Solar Power if it is brought in when sun is up.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Charizard X should avoid switching in directly on neutral attacks, especially when Stealth Rock is up. It is optimal to bring it in either on weaker moves, through pivot support, or after a teammate has fainted. Mega Evolving as soon as possible is optimal to grant Mega Charizard X a new resistance to Electric as well as a neutrality to Water. This also removes Charizard's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock; however, it becomes susceptible to Spikes and Toxic Spikes as a result. However, if Charizard has the opportunity to set up on Landorus-T lacking Stone Edge, it can hold off on Mega Evolving to avoid Ground-type attacks. Despite its ability to check a variety of Grass-types, Mega Charizard X's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock prior to Mega Evolving and vulnerability to all forms of entry hazards after mean it cannot consistently pivot into them. It can, however, use weak Grass-type attacks such as Tangrowth's Giga Drain as an opportunity to switch in and gain setup turns. It is best to use Mega Charizard X and set up mid- or late-game after its checks in bulky Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Gastrodon have been weakened or eliminated. Priority users such as Ash-Greninja and Mega Mawile should also be removed if Mega Charizard X is not able to heal itself with Roost, as these Pokemon can revenge kill it after some chip damage. Mega Charizard X should be cautious of using its STAB moves; Flare Blitz forces it to take heavy recoil damage, which can be used to weaken Mega Charizard X into range of priority, so when it KOes a Fire-weak foe, it should be wary of its HP. Outrage, on the other hand, locks Mega Charizard X in, meaning that if it KOes a foe, a powerful Fairy-type such as Mega Mawile, Magearna, or Tapu Lele can be brought in for free to KO it. While Mega Charizard X is an effective sweeper late-game, it can also wallbreak earlier in the match to soften its own checks like Toxapex and Tapu Fini. Mega Charizard X should proactively use Roost when its HP is getting low; it can take advantage of free turns where it forces opposing Pokemon out in order to switch to a counter to regain its HP. Toxic poison and paralysis heavily cripple Mega Charizard X, so it should avoid directly switching into foes such as Toxapex, Heatran, and Clefable. Mega Charizard X is also heavily reliant on its Attack stat to break through and sweep teams, so it struggles against Intimidate from Landorus-T and struggles to find setup opportunities when it pivots in; make sure it is weakened before setting up so it cannot pivot around Mega Charizard X and weaken its offensive presence.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Charizard X fits best on offensive or bulky offense teams that appreciate a setup sweeper that can punish common Steel- and Grass-types. Due to Mega Charizard X's vulnerability to entry hazards due to its 4x weakness to Stealth Rock prior to Mega Evolving, it appreciates partners that can clear those hazards, such as Tornadus-T, Gliscor, and Tapu Fini; the latter also protects it from status after Mega Evolving due to Misty Terrain. It also appreciates secondary forms of hazard removal such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Choice Scarf Serperior. Mega Charizard X also appreciates entry hazard support from its own teammates to chip its switch-ins such as Tapu Fini. Thus, Ferrothorn, Garchomp, and Clefable pair well with Mega Charizard X. Pivot support such as U-turn from Tornadus-T and Landorus-T helps to bring Mega Charizard X in on a free switch so it avoids taking extra damage and allows it to complete its role more easily. Bulky Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Toxapex are difficult for Mega Charizard X to break through, especially when it's unboosted. Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Tapu Lele that can take advantage of these foes benefit Mega Charizard X, with the latter appreciating Mega Charizard X removing Steel-types for it. Due to Mega Charizard X's susceptibility to Ground-type moves from Landorus-T and Garchomp after Mega Evolving, reliable switch-ins and checks to these foes like Celesteela and Tapu Bulu are good teammates. In return, Mega Charizard X can break through Steel-types for them. As Mega Charizard X can effectively sweep weakened teams at +1, wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele and Kartana can help to weaken the opposing team and break through some of its checks.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Flamethrower is Mega Charizard Y's best STAB option due to its consistent Base Power, accuracy, and PP. Flamethrower sacrifices raw power in exchange for pressuring stall teams once Chansey and Toxapex are eliminated from the field. Fire Blast is another option that can be run on teams that prefer the chance to OHKO Tapu Lele and Landorus-T with Fire Blast to the consistency of Flamethrower. Additionally, it 2HKOes offensive Garchomp. Focus Blast hits Tyranitar, which overrides Charizard's sun and halves the power of Solar Beam, as well as Heatran, which otherwise walls Charizard. Solar Beam becomes a one-turn move in the sun, letting Charizard beat the Water- and Rock-types that resist its Fire-type STAB moves. Alternatively, Defog can be run, as Mega Charizard Y is an effective entry hazard remover against Pokemon like Ferrothorn. Mega Charizard Y should be run alongside another Defogger, though, because of its crippling weakness to Stealth Rock. Roost gives Charizard longevity, letting it recover off Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature lets Charizard outspeed Tapu Lele and Kyurem-B and ensures it Speed ties with other base 100s such as Mega Medicham. Blaze is used as Charizard's pre-Mega ability to avoid taking damage from opposing sun.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Charizard to wallbreak early-game. By softening opposing walls, Charizard will give its teammates more opportunities to sweep late-game. Very few Pokemon are able to safely switch into Mega Charizard Y. Make efforts to safely bring Charizard in against Pokemon it can force out or otherwise KO to put pressure on the opposing team. If possible, remove Stealth Rock or prevent it from being set up before bringing in Charizard to avoid having it lose half of its health.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard removal is important to keep Charizard healthy. Landorus, Kartana, and Tapu Koko can use Defog, while Excadrill can use Rapid Spin. Pursuit support from the likes of Weavile and Choice Band Tyranitar is nice to pick off Latios and Mega Latias. These Pokemon can also pressure Chansey. Heatran is also an excellent partner for Charizard, as it is able to trap and eliminate both Toxapex and Chansey. Adding onto Heatran as a teammate, Choice Scarf Victini is a great teammate as it can bypass some of Mega Charizard Y's checks and counters such as Mega Latias with Final Gambit or work with Drought to unleash a devastating STAB V-Create. Since many offensive Pokemon, such as Tapu Koko and Greninja, are able to revenge kill Mega Charizard Y, switch-ins to these Pokemon are required. Pivots like Assault Vest Tangrowth can make good answers. Volt Switch and U-turn users can bring Charizard in safely. Tapu Koko and Greninja fill these roles well, as they tend to force in defensive Grass-types that Charizard can take advantage of. Late-game sweepers appreciate Mega Charizard Y's ability to wallbreak. Shift Gear Magearna and Ash-Greninja make good partners in this regard.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Outrage allows Mega Charizard X to break through common Fire-resistant Pokemon such as Toxapex and Garchomp. It does lock Mega Charizard X in and prevents it from switching out of problematic Fairy-types such as Mega Mawile, however. Dragon Claw can be run instead of Outrage to circumvent Mega Charizard X being trapped and confused by the move, but it is a lot weaker than Outrage and fails to pressure common Fire-resistant Pokemon like Toxapex and does not OHKO bulky variants of Garchomp. Unlike Outrage, it also does not 2HKO Pyukumuku and Quagsire. Earthquake enables Mega Charizard X to hit Heatran super effectively, and it can also be used to damage some other Ground-weak Steel-types like Magearna and Magnezone without Mega Charizard X having to take recoil damage. Roost maintains Mega Charizard X's HP due to it being whittled down easily by Stealth Rock, Flare Blitz recoil, and passive damage such as Iron Barbs from Ferrothorn and Rocky Helmet from Tornadus-T.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Jolly nature enables Mega Charizard X to outspeed Tapu Lele, Kyurem-B, and Gliscor. As a wallbreaker, it doesn't need to invest in bulk. Running Blaze as Charizard's pre-Mega ability prevents it from being damaged by Solar Power if it is brought in when sun is up.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Charizard X can act as a powerful wallbreaker early- or mid-game able to weaken several key metagame staples such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, Magearna, and Tangrowth. Safely bringing Mega Charizard X in on a free turn either from pivot support or after a teammate has fainted is optimal; however, it can be brought in on weak resisted attacks such as Tapu Bulu's Horn Leech to give it free turns to Mega Evolve. Mega Evolving early-game is preferred to mitigate Mega Charizard X's 4x Stealth Rock weakness; however, it does become susceptible to every other form of entry hazard while preserving a Stealth Rock weakness. If entry hazards aren't present and after Charizard has Mega Evolved, it can switch into Pokemon it checks more proactively. Mega Charizard X's STAB moves are easy to punish, so it should be cautious when using them, as Flare Blitz's recoil can be used to weaken Mega Charizard X into range of priority. When it KOes a Pokemon weak to Fire such as Tangrowth or Ferrothorn, it should be wary of its HP. Outrage traps Mega Charizard X, so if it KOes a foe, a Fairy-type such as Tapu Lele or Mega Mawile can come in for free and KO Mega Charizard X. Thus, it should only use the move if Fairy-types are all eliminated or it is required for it to KO a threat to itself and its teammates. Mega Charizard X should actively predict foes to switch in; if a Fire-resistant or -immune foe such as Toxapex or Heatran is predicted to switch in, using Outrage or Earthquake can severely weaken or KO one is Mega Charizard X's checks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard removal is crucial when running Mega Charizard X due to its need to switch in often to wallbreak; before it Mega Evolves, Stealth Rock removes half of its HP, and it is vulnerable to Spikes and Toxic Spikes after it does. Partners such as Tornadus-T and Gliscor, as well as secondary forms of hazard removal such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Kartana, provide this removal. Tapu Fini also provides reliable hazard removal as well as Misty Terrain to block status once Charizard has Mega Evolved. Mega Charizard X's weakness to common Ground-type attackers like Garchomp and Landorus-T warrants checks for these; the aforementioned Defoggers as well as other checks like Tangrowth provide this for Mega Charizard X. Due to Mega Charizard X's lack of a setup move, it struggles to break through bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Tapu Fini. As a result, checks to those like Tapu Bulu and Tapu Koko benefit Mega Charizard X. Mega Charizard X's wallbreaking ability can be further aided by teammates that can set up entry hazards for it such as Garchomp, Ferrothorn, and Clefable. It can also wallbreak more effectively when brought in via pivot support; Tornadus-T and Rotom-W can bring Mega Charizard X in safely with U-turn or Volt Switch. Since Mega Charizard X is unable to boost its only average Speed stat and as a result struggles with faster Pokemon, teammates that can check these faster foes such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Ash-Greninja are good partners for Mega Charizard X. In return, Mega Charizard X can break through their checks such as Tangrowth.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Nidoking's access to a great pool of Sheer Force-boosted coverage options such as Ice Beam, Flamethrower, and Thunderbolt allows it to deal heavy damage to defensive Pokemon like Zapdos, Toxapex, Tapu Fini, Landorus-T, and Tangrowth. Its great typing combination grants it immunities to Electric-type attacks, Thunder Wave, and Toxic and lets it absorb Toxic Spikes, something most wallbreakers in the tier cannot do, thus giving it a defensive niche. However, it must compete with stronger or faster wallbreakers in the metagame like Kyurem-B, Hoopa-U, and Mega Charizard Y, and its mediocre bulk and Speed tier make it vulnerable to fast offensive threats like Greninja, Garchomp, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Lele, which doesn't help much in that regard.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>In general, Nidoking is better off running a special set than a physical one, since most of its Sheer Force-boosted moves are special. Superpower can deal heavy damage to Chansey but unfortunately requires a good amount of EVs invested in Attack. Thunderbolt can be run in the last slot, as it allows Nidoking to OHKO Mantine and Gyarados while also being an alternate way of hitting Celesteela and Tornadus-T for good damage. Stealth Rock is also usable over one of Nidoking's coverage moves to provide hazard support in emergency cases, as Nidoking is able to force out common Defog users like Mega Scizor and Tapu Fini. Sucker Punch with the help of 16 EVs invested into Attack, Nidoking can outspeed and KO Gengar and Mega Alakazam, but other than that, it's not that worthwhile to run the move over Ice Beam or Flamethrower.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Threats: Faster threats such as Keldeo, Garchomp, Landorus-T, Excadrill, and Mega Alakazam can easily revenge kill Nidoking.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Thanks to Chansey's tremendously high special bulk, it is able to switch into any of Nidoking's attacks and can proceed to whittle it down with Seismic Toss or set up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Latios can easily check Nidoking; however, none of them can switch into Nidoking for free.</p> <p><strong>Assault Vest Tornadus-T: While Tornadus-T cannot switch in safely on Nidoking, it can beat it one-on-one by removing its item with Knock Off and then proceeding to KO with Hurricane after taking damage from Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Celesteela</strong>: Specially defensive Celesteela avoids a 2HKO from Flamethrower from Nidoking and can retaliate back with Heavy Slam, annoy it with Leech Seed, and then stall with Protect.</p> <p><strong>Strong Water-types</strong>: Offensive Water-types such as Greninja and Manaphy are able to outspeed Nidoking and OHKO it with their Water-type STAB moves, while Azumarill is able to deal heavy damage with Aqua Jet.</p> ",

Sludge Wave lets Nidoking break through defensive threats such as Tangrowth, Tapu Fini, and Clefable as well as slower offensive threats like Tapu Bulu. Ice Beam's coverage enables Nidoking to deal heavy damage to bulkier Pokemon like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Zapdos, and Amoonguss. Substitute provides room for Nidoking and eases predicting switches, making a huge difference when playing against offensive teams. It also prevents Nidoking from getting easily revenge killed, which is a great attribute because it has very few checks, but Flamethrower can also be run to break through defensive Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor. Fire Blast over Flamethrower is also an alternate option that can 2HKO specially defensive Celesteela in exchange for the accuracy drop.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Special Attack maximizes Nidoking's power. Life Orb boosts its power even more and also pairs well with Sheer Force, as it negates the recoil received. Full investment in Speed allows Nidoking to outspeed everything up to Adamant Mimikyu.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use pivots and Volt Switch and U-turn users against offensive teams to switch in Nidoking unscratched, which will allow it to apply immense offensive pressure on its foe. Take advantage of the switches Nidoking can force by going for Substitute. This allows it to apply a lot of offensive pressure while also forcing the opponent to go for certain moves that one can further take advantage of. Nidoking can also be switched into weakened, bulkier Pokemon like Skarmory or a predicted Moonblast from Tapu Fini and proceed to use its two main STAB moves and coverage moves to break through the team, helping faster teammates potentially clean late-game. In order to utilize Nidoking to its fullest, the player is required to predict switches and use its coverage moves accordingly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Tapu Koko, Landorus-T, and Mega Scizor make for good partners with Nidoking, as they are able to pivot around and switch in Nidoking safely. A faster threat like Mega Alakazam is able to outspeed and check offensive teams that Nidoking usually struggles against. Setup sweepers such as Magearna, Double Dance Landorus-T, and Mega Pinsir can sweep late-game after Nidoking has weakened the opposing team. Strong physical attackers like Garchomp, Hoopa-U, Mega Heracross, and Tapu Bulu make great teammates for Nidoking, as they are able to break through Chansey, which Nidoking struggles against. Switch-ins to Psychic-type attacks like Celesteela and Jirachi can be paired with Nidoking on bulkier teams, while the latter can also provide entry hazard support. Switch-ins to strong Water-type attacks like Tapu Fini, Tapu Bulu, Tangrowth, and Keldeo are greatly appreciated as well.</p> "

  "Clefable": {
    "overview": "<p>Clefable's decent bulk, reliable recovery, and fantastic defensive typing allow it to act as a solid check to Pokemon like Garchomp, Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Hawlucha, making it a valuable defensive Pokemon in the tier. It also has access to two fantastic abilities in Magic Guard and Unaware, sprouting into several different sets. Defensive Magic Guard Clefable provides wonderful utility to bulky offensive and balanced teams thanks to its ability to act as a status absorber and use moves like Stealth Rock, Calm Mind, and Thunder Wave. Magic Guard can also be run on an offensive set utilizing Life Orb and Clefable's fantastic coverage, trading most of its defensive capabilities to turn it into a terrifying wallbreaker with very few switch-ins. Unaware Clefable, on the other hand, is a great asset to stall teams thanks to its ability to stop setup sweepers in their tracks with the ability to ignore their boosts. Furthermore, with Calm Mind, it can beat setup sweepers that it wouldn't be able to otherwise such as Swords Dance Gliscor, Calm Mind Reuniclus, and Calm Mind Blacephalon, all of which are big threats to the stall archetype. These boons and the fact that it can also heal status with Heal Bell and pass Wish to its teammates make Unaware Clefable a stall team mainstay. However, Clefable does have its own shortcomings. Its rather lackluster offensive presence if not running Life Orb means it invites a plethora of dangerous wallbreakers such as Heatran, Magearna, Mega Mawile, Tapu Bulu, and Volcarona, although Clefable's expansive moveset means these Pokemon can be surprised by moves like Thunder Wave and Fire Blast. Additionally, its bulk is quite mediocre for a defensive Pokemon, making it prone to losing to the Pokemon it is supposed to check if it is chipped even slightly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Clefable has other useful moves like Toxic and Healing Wish but their applications tend to be more limited than moves already listed on the sets, meaning they're hard to fit. Stored Power alongside Calm Mind is an interesting option that allows Clefable to break through some stall teams, as Stored Power means Clefable can break through Unaware walls. However, the set is unable to break through stall teams utilizing Mega Aggron and is forced to drop all of its utility moves in order to fit Calm Mind, Moonblast, Stored Power, and Soft-Boiled, meaning the set can oftentimes be deadweight.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types like Magearna, Mega Mawile, and Mega Scizor can safely come in on and force out defensive Clefable due to it only having Moonblast as an attacking move. They must be wary of Fire Blast, however, bar Heatran.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Heatran, Volcarona, and Victini fear very little from Clefable and can threaten it. Heatran can trap Clefable with Taunt and Magma Storm or OHKO it with Corkscrew Crash, Volcarona can set up on Clefable, and Victini can blow it up with a powerful V-create. They all need be wary of Thunder Wave, however.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers: Though defensive Clefable is quite bulky, it cannot handle strong wallbreakers like Ash-Greninja, Mega Medicham, Tapu Lele, and Mega Tyranitar, all of which can take advantage of Clefable's middling bulk with their raw power.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Toxapex and Mega Venusaur aren't fazed by anything defensive Clefable can do to them—Toxapex can Haze away any Calm Mind boosts, Mega Venusaur is faster, takes reduced damage from Fire Blast thanks to Thick Fat, and deals heavy damage to Clefable with Sludge Bomb even after a Calm Mind boost, and neither is particularly fast, meaning they don't mind Thunder Wave.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind bolsters Clefable's Special Attack and Special Defense, making it easier to keep Stealth Rock up against Defoggers like Tornadus-T and Zapdos. It also helps Clefable against special attackers like Mega Alakazam, Mega Latios, and Kyurem. Thunder Wave is an alternative that cripples Pokemon like Heatran, Magearna, Volcarona, and Choice Scarf Jirachi that would otherwise fear nothing from Clefable. If Clefable's team already has a reliable Stealth Rock setter, both Calm Mind and Thunder Wave can be run on the same set. Wish alongside Soft-Boiled may seem unconventional, but it can be a good option to heal Clefable's teammates, especially if Clefable is paired with a Pokemon that lacks reliable recovery, such as Heatran, Celesteela, or Garchomp. Knock Off is also a decent option in the last slot to remove held items from Pokemon like Heatran, Magearna, and Celesteela that rely on Leftovers recovery.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in HP and Defense allows Clefable to handle the myriad of physical attackers in the tier such as Garchomp, Hawlucha, and Mega Lopunny and set up Stealth Rock consistently throughout the match while healing with Soft-Boiled. Alternatively, a specially defensive spread of 252 HP / 164 Def / 92 SpD with a Calm nature can be used to enable Clefable to avoid the 2HKO from Mega Alakazam's Psychic at full HP, even if its Leftovers has been removed. This can be used if Clefable's team would prefer it to have a better matchup against specially offensive threats like Mega Alakazam, Life Orb Kyurem-B, and Mega Latios.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Clefable is quite straightforward to use: it should mainly be used to check Pokemon like Landorus-T, Mega Lopunny, and Hawlucha and set up Stealth Rock. Make sure to use Soft-Boiled regularly to keep Clefable healthy enough to check the listed threats. Because Clefable sets up Stealth Rock, Defoggers like Tornadus-T, Tapu Fini, and Zapdos will often come in and try to remove it. Take advantage of this by setting up a Calm Mind to force them out. Thunder Wave should be used often early-game to cripple common switch-ins such as Heatran and Magearna. Don't use Stealth Rock immediately if Clefable leads against a Mega Sableye, as it is highly likely they will use Protect first turn so they can safely Mega Evolve and gain Magic Bounce. Instead, use Calm Mind to threaten it out, or if not running Calm Mind, simply throw out a Moonblast. Avoid taking a Knock Off, as Clefable's Leftovers is instrumental to its ability to check the aforementioned Pokemon and remain healthy throughout the match.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set fits best on bulky offensive and balanced teams because they value Clefable's defensive niche and its ability to set Stealth Rock. Clefable synergizes well with bulky Grass-types like Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Mega Venusaur, as it is a sturdy Dark-resistant Pokemon, meaning it can relieve them of some pressure from Ash-Greninja. In return, they help Clefable with specially offensive Pokemon it can't deal with such as Magearna and Tapu Koko. Ferrothorn, in particular, is noteworthy, as it can help to wear down Heatran with entry hazards, Leech Seed, and potentially Knock Off. Steel-types like Magearna, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor and Fire-types like Heatran and Volcarona can quite easily take advantage of Clefable, especially if it lacks Thunder Wave, so answers to them like Toxapex, Rotom-W, and your own Heatran should be used. Similarly, Clefable has a hard time with Poison-types like Toxapex and Mega Venusaur, so Pokemon like Mega Alakazam, Tapu Lele, and Reuniclus that can deal with them are necessary. If opting to run Thunder Wave, slow wallbreakers that benefit from paralysis being spread are nice teammates. In a similar vein, if Clefable has Wish, it pairs very well with offensive wallbreakers lacking recovery such as Z-Move Heatran, Mega Mawile, and Garchomp.</p> "

Flamethrower is a fine alternative, boasting perfect accuracy, but it is noticeably weaker. Soft-Boiled allows Clefable to stay healthy enough to take Greninja's Dark Pulse numerous times and continue taking advantage of passive Pokemon.

Though this set forfeits the vast majority of defensive prowess other Clefable sets possess, it can be used to switch into some Dark-type moves like Ash-Greninja's and Hydreigon's Dark Pulse if you are confident they will go for it. Additionally, Clefable can take advantage of some more passive Pokemon in the tier like Toxapex and Zapdos. Soft-Boiled should be used somewhat regularly to keep Clefable healthy enough to take advantage of these Pokemon while also allowing it to keep taking Dark Pulses.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Life Orb Clefable fits best on bulky offensive teams as a frightening wallbreaker. Ferrothorn is a fantastic teammate, as it appreciates Clefable's resistance to Greninja's Dark Pulse and does a fantastic job at wearing down Heatran, which is one of the few switch-ins to Life Orb Clefable, with Leech Seed and entry hazard damage. Other entry hazard setters like Ash-Greninja, Heatran, and Garchomp are good partners to wear down Pokemon like Heatran and Toxapex for Clefable. Pokemon that resist Water-type moves like Toxapex, Amoonguss, and the aforementioned Ferrothorn pair well with Clefable to give a team resistances to both of Ash-Greninja's STAB moves.

Maximum investment in its HP and Defense ensures it can continue to take hits from these Pokemon, recover damage, and continue setting up.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Clefable should be used to check setup sweepers like Landorus-T, Garchomp, Gliscor, and Mega Heracross. Calm Mind should be set up on Pokemon like Calm Mind Mega Latias, Swords Dance Gliscor, Calm Mind Reuniclus, and Calm Mind Blacephalon in order for Clefable to beat them one-on-one. Make sure to use Wish followed by Protect regularly to keep Clefable healthy enough to check these Pokemon. Try to catch Z-Moves from the likes of Kyurem, Gyarados, and Calm Mind Blacephalon with Protect, as otherwise they can break through Clefable. Wish can also be used to heal Clefable's teammates or bring them in safely on a Pokemon that threatens Clefable out. For example, if you expect Tapu Lele to come in on Clefable, you can use Wish predicting the switch to it and pass the Wish to Mega Aggron to bring it in safely.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set only fits on stall, as it's the only archetype that doesn't mind Clefable giving up all momentum and can appropriately make up for its defensive shortcomings. Chansey is a stall staple and covers nearly every specially offensive threat in the tier for Clefable and can free it up to run Calm Mind by running Heal Bell. In return, Clefable covers a majority of physically offensive wallbreakers that Chansey can't handle. Mega Aggron covers Pokemon like Magearna, Mega Mawile, and Tapu Lele that Chansey can't deal with, and in return Clefable provides it with recovery in Wish and covers Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor and Fighting-types like Mega Lopunny and Hawlucha. Zapdos switches into wallbreakers like Kartana and Tapu Bulu for Clefable while also removing entry hazards with Defog. Mew can switch into Heatran and Tapu Lele for Clefable while also running Defog to remove troublesome entry hazards.</p> "

  "Ninetales-Alola": {
    "overview": "<p>As the only Pokemon with access to both Aurora Veil and Snow Warning, Alolan Ninetales carves itself a niche in OU as the only viable user of the former. Between its good Speed stat and its access to both Hypnosis and Encore, Alolan Ninetales is able to set up Aurora Veil against a large portion of the tier without fearing setup sweepers taking advantage of it as it does so, and it forces out a number of Pokemon in the important base 90 to 108 Speed bracket such as Landorus-T, Mega Medicham, Garchomp, and Keldeo. Furthermore, its access to Freeze-Dry allows it to shut down large portions of rain teams when combined with Snow Warning, and Alolan Ninetales's good Special Defense stat allows it to take a decently strong neutral special hit in order to set up Aurora Veil if it absolutely needs to. That said, it is both grounded and weak to Stealth Rock, which makes it very vulnerable to entry hazards, and while Fairy is nice for shutting down Pokemon like Garchomp and Latios locked into their respective Dragon-type STAB moves, its secondary Ice typing does very little in the way of providing defensive synergy with teammates while compounding its weakness to the omnipresent Steel type. Furthermore, Alolan Ninetales's decent Special Defense is contrasted by its abysmal physical bulk, which leaves it very vulnerable to physical attackers before setting up Aurora Veil, and its low Special Attack leaves it unable to pose as a threat to Mega Charizard Y that block its setup attempts by overwriting hail with Drought. It is also an easy target for Volcarona to set up on if something is already put to sleep by Hypnosis.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Steel-type such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn much harder. Hidden Power Ground can be used to 2HKO maximum HP Heatran after Stealth Rock as well as Assault Vest Magnezone after one layer of Spikes. Disable is an option to shut down certain attacks and is useful versus Choice item users by forcing them to either switch or use Struggle, but this leaves Alolan Ninetales vulnerable to setup sweepers. Toxic is an option to alleviate Alolan Ninetales's passiveness and is useful for wearing down bulky Pokemon for teammates, whereas Nasty Plot achieves the same goal by boosting Alolan Ninetales's Special Attack stat sharply, which is useful for reducing its reliance on teammates to break through the opposing team.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Mega Charizard Y: Mega Charizard Y blocks attempts to set up Aurora Veil by overwriting hail with Drought, takes very little damage from any of Alolan Ninetales's attacks barring the inaccurate Blizzard, which fails to 2HKO it, and returns the favor by dealing heavy damage to Ninetales or one of its teammates with a sun-boosted Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Mega Scizor takes very little damage from anything other than the rare Hidden Power Fire and gets close to OHKOing Alolan Ninetales through Aurora Veil with Bullet Punch. Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Jirachi take very little damage from Freeze Dry and can hit it back with their respective Steel-type moves. Any of these can also use Alolan Ninetales as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards: Alolan Ninetales is both grounded and weak to Stealth Rock, making it easy to wear down between Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes. Furthermore, its vulnerability to Sticky Web means that it will lose its potent Speed tier when pitted against teams that carry it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Alolan Marowak and Heatran take very little from Alolan Ninetales's STAB moves, and they both threaten it heavily with STAB moves of their own. Volcarona is slower than Alolan Ninetales, takes very little from any of its attacks, and outpaces it after one boost, meaning that it is not threatened by Encore and concequently uses non-Hypnosis Alolan Ninetales for setup fodder. Mega Charizard X is in the same boat, although it needs to be wary of a potential Blizzard.</p> <p><strong>Sand Stream Users: Hippowdon and Tyranitar are capable of acting as a roadblock to Alolan Ninetales's attempts to use Aurora Veil, although Hippowdon needs to watch out for Freeze Dry.</p> ",

        "name": "Aurora Veil",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Aurora Veil lets Alolan Ninetales support its teammates by temporarily halving the damage taken from the opposing team's attacks, which opens up more opportunities to dish out hits and set up. Freeze-Dry allows Alolan Ninetales to have an excellent matchup versus rain—a playstyle that commonly gives offensive teams a headache—by hitting Pelipper, Mega Swampert, and Kingdra 4x super effectively, and it also means Gyarados can't use Alolan Ninetales as setup fodder. Hypnosis shuts down Pokemon that attempt to set up in front of Alolan Ninetales like Volcarona and Mega Tyranitar while also creating free turns for teammates. Hail is used to help improve the matchup versus Mega Charizard Y that attempt to block Aurora Veil with Drought by undoing the weather change to sun on the turn it switches in, as well as Tyranitar. Encore is an option that shuts down slower, non-Speed-boosting setup sweepers without requiring the preservation of Sleep Clause while pressuring defensive Pokemon like Toxapex more consistently than Hypnosis.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature is important to best take advantage of Alolan Ninetales's good Speed stat, allowing it to use Aurora Veil with as much consistency as possible and outpacing the base 95 to 108 Speed bracket; its HP is also maximized to allow it to set up Aurora Veil as much as possible throughout the match. Snow Warning allows Alolan Ninetales to set up hail on the turn that it is sent out, which is necessary to ensure maximum consistency when setting up Aurora Veil. Light Clay maximizes the duration of said move, which is important to maximize the amount of utility that Alolan Ninetales brings to the table.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Avoid switching Alolan Ninetales into attacks directly if possible and instead aim to bring it in on a slow Volt Switch or U-turn, after a teammate is KOed, or on a well-predicted double switch; similarly, aim to bring Alolan Ninetales in against Pokemon that it forces out to ensure that Aurora Veil can be set up safely. If you see Volcarona or Mega Charizard X on the opposing team, don't put a different foe to sleep in order to prevent them using Alolan Ninetales for setup fodder. If Ninetales carries Encore, use it against Pokemon that are slower than Ninetales after they set up, and don't be afraid to shut down certain defensive Pokemon like Toxapex and Ice Beam Mew if the situation requires you to do so. Avoid taking Knock Off if possible to maximize the duration of Aurora Veil on consecutive uses, but don't be afraid to take one hit with Alolan Ninetales if it is necessary. If Alolan Ninetales is about to faint and Aurora Veil isn't active, use the opportunity to set it up and let Alolan Ninetales faint to grab momentum late-game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Setup attackers like Magearna, Mega Tyranitar, Volcarona, Gyarados, Suicune, and Bisharp all massively appreciate Aurora Veil due to its ability to make setting up easier; Bisharp is also nice for discouraging attempts to clear Aurora Veil with Defog, whereas Volcarona takes advantage of Aurora Veil to circumvent Rock-type moves from Choice Scarf users, which are used to revenge kill it after a boost, such as Keldeo's Stone Edge. Breakers such as Mega Mawile appreciate Aurora Veil's ability to give them more breathing room when spamming their absurdly strong attacks, allowing them to deal significantly more damage to the opposing team. Bulky attackers such as Shift Gear Magearna are helpful for reducing the team's reliance on Aurora Veil while becoming extremely hard to break when the effect is on the field. Other strong set up Pokemon such as Waterium Z Tail Glow Manaphy and Landorus-T are effective because they are able to set up on a plethora of attacks as well as being much more difficult to revenge kill.</p> "

  "Alakazam": {
    "overview": "<p>Alakazam is a notable threat in the OU metagame due to the valuable offensive niche it holds. Mega Alakazam is a fantastic special wallbreaker and sweeper, as its great Speed means it is outsped only by some Choice Scarf users. It also possesses the highest Special Attack stat in the tier as well as a useful ability in Trace, which lets it copy a plethora of useful abilities. It can copy Flash Fire and Levitate, letting it wall Heatran and Mega Latios lacking Draco Meteor, respectively. Regenerator can be copied from the likes of Toxapex, Tangrowth, and Tornadus-T to keep Mega Alakazam healthy. And even other situational abilities like Swift Swim, Beast Boost, and Soul-Heart can be occasionally copied. However, Mega Alakazam to some extent struggles to hurt some bulkier teams due to the presence of Magearna, Celesteela, and Ferrothorn. Regular Alakazam's niche lies in its access to Magic Guard, which allows it to run a Life Orb set that, just like Mega Alakazam, can switch into threats like Heatran reliably and force them out. Unfortunately, Alakazam is extremely frail and is thus extremely vulnerable to Choice Scarf users and priority, which are both quite common. They also are susceptible to common attacks in Pursuit, U-turn, and Knock Off.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A set with Focus Sash and Counter can be used to catch physically offensive Pokemon off guard and can check dangerous threats thanks to Magic Guard ignoring entry hazards and Toxic Spikes's residual damage. Signal Beam is an option for either set to hit Hoopa-U. However, it is overshadowed by the coverage options listed on the main sets, which adequately cover Hoopa-U already. Mega Alakazam can run a lot of different moves for the last slot. Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Ferrothorn more reliably while hitting the likes of Mega Scizor and Celesteela, which otherwise wall Mega Alakazam, for super effective damage. Substitute prevents Mega Alakazam from being hit by status attacks and eases prediction against Sucker Punch users and switches. Taunt can be used in the fourth slot as well; it prevents foes from recovering, setting up, or inflicting status and allows Mega Alakazam to shut down several Pokemon seen on stall teams. Dazzling Gleam is also an option to more reliably hit Dark-types and hit Mega Sableye and Hoopa-U super effectively, but it isn't preferred due to Focus Blast's much greater power and the loss of the utility provided by other moves. Energy Ball can be used as well to hit Gastrodon and Mega Swampert, which Mega Alakazam can adequately revenge kill after acquiring Swift Swim with Trace.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Priority: Powerful priority attacks, such as Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch, Mega Medicham's Fake Out, and Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch are extremely threatening to Mega Alakazam, as its poor bulk and lack of its own priority prevents it from tanking these attacks or retaliating. It can, however, potentially avoid priority attacks under Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Although some Steel-types fear Focus Blast, many have ways around Alakazam. Mega Scizor can use either Pursuit or U-turn to dent Alakazam, while Magearna and Celesteela can both reliably tank its attacks and wear it down with their own. Jirachi can cripple Alakazam with paralysis and proceed to revenge kill it with Iron Head, while Ferrothorn can always tank at least one Focus Blast and, in return, set up entry hazards or OHKO either forme with one of its STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types: Bulky Psychic-types such as Mew, Jirachi, and Reuniclus can tank even a Shadow Ball or two and, in return, cripple Alakazam with status or threaten it with powerful attacks.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Dark-types such as Hoopa-U and Mega Sableye can more often than not tank a hit and OHKO Mega Alakazam or non-Focus Sash variants of its base forme with super effective STAB attacks. Alolan Muk is particularly troublesome to Mega Alakazam, as Alolan Muk threatens it with Pursuit and can reliably tank any of its attacks with an Assault Vest.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit: Pursuit from the likes of Weavile, Tyranitar, and particularly Alolan Muk, which despite being uncommon can tank all of Mega Alakazam's hits, can surprise Mega Alakazam by trapping and KOing it as it tries switching out, which can prove quite troublesome.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey's phenomenal special bulk prevents it from taking much damage from any of Alakazam's commonly seen attacks, while in return it can threaten to wear Alakazam down with Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Common wielders of Choice Scarf such as Landorus-T, Kartana, and Greninja can all outspeed and threaten Alakazam, though all should be wary of switching in.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Focus Blast offers excellent coverage alongside Psychic, allowing Mega Alakazam to hit Steel-types such as Excadrill, Heatran, and Magnezone and Dark-types like Ash-Greninja and Tyranitar super effectively. Recover enables Mega Alakazam to much better handle the likes of Heatran, Mega Latios lacking Draco Meteor, and Toxapex. Tracing Flash Fire and Levitate is part of what enables Alakazam to wall Heatran and Mega Latios, respectively, but that can't be done consistently without Recover. As for the last slot, Shadow Ball hits Psychic-types that otherwise wall Mega Alakazam, such as Tapu Lele, Jirachi, Mew, and Reuniclus. Calm Mind is also another solid option, which boosts Mega Alakazam's Special Attack and Special Defense, allowing for it to pose a massive threat as a sweeper late-game. Knock Off allows Mega Alakazam to cripple traditional switch-ins like Celesteela as well as Assault Vest Tangrowth and Magearna. Hidden Power Ice is an option to OHKO Gliscor and Landorus-T while still picking up a 2HKO on Mega Latios.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Timid nature is preferred to outspeed Mega Lopunny, Ash-Greninja, and Modest Mega Alakazam. A Modest nature can be run if it isn't necessary to guarantee outspeeding Mega Lopunny and Ash-Greninja as well as Speed tying with Timid Mega Alakazam. Magic Guard is the best ability to give Alakazam prior to Mega Evolving, allowing it to take zero damage from entry hazards upon switching in.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Due to its high Special Attack and Speed, Mega Alakazam's best use is as a late-game sweeper on balanced and offensive teams that can also wallbreak earlier on in a match. If it's attempting a sweep, it is important for opposing Pokemon to be weakened by teammates or residual damage to ensure that Mega Alakazam can clean properly. Priority users like Mega Mawile, Mega Scizor, and Mega Pinsir should be removed before sweeping is attempted due to Mega Alakazam's frailty; Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T, Kartana, and Victini should be scouted out and removed as well for similar reasons. Pokemon that are capable of adequately checking Mega Alakazam, such as Magearna, Celesteela, and Assault Vest Tangrowth, should also be removed so that it can sweep successfully.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Fairy-types like Tapu Fini, Clefable, and Magearna can help dispose of Dark-types, and Tapu Lele in particular can summon Psychic Terrain for Mega Alakazam to help boost the power of its STAB attacks and nullify priority attacks despite sharing a Ghost-type weakness. Steel-type checks are also appreciated as teammates due to the presence of Steel-type Pokemon that take neutral damage from Focus Blast, like Magearna and Celesteela. Magnezone is notable for its ability to trap and KO these Steel-types, while Heatran and Volcarona are also reliable means of removing the aforementioned threats, though the former should be wary of directly switching in. Dark-type Pokemon such as Ash-Greninja, Tyranitar, and Weavile make useful teammates due to their ability to pressure the bulky Psychic-types that Mega Alakazam can struggle to break through. Wallbreakers like Garchomp, Tapu Bulu, and Life Orb Clefable can weaken the opposing team for Mega Alakazam early-game. Spikes support from the likes of Greninja and Ferrothorn also softens up the opposition for Mega Alakazam. Pivots such as Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Zapdos are appreciated by Mega Alakazam for their ability to safely bring it into play and prevent it from taking any hits. Heatran is able to trap some of Mega Alakazam's checks, including Chansey, and is able to reliably remove Steel-type Pokemon such as Celesteela, Magearna, and Mawile, while also being able to break past bulky Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth, which could otherwise wall Alakazam.</p> "

Focus Blast is the ideal coverage move on this set, being able to beat Steel- and Dark-types that switch into Psychic like Heatran and Tyranitar. Shadow Ball nails Psychic-types like Mega Latios and Reuniclus while simultaneously being a solid neutral attacking move. Hidden Power Fire is preferred to beat Mega Scizor and to reliably hit Ferrothorn without having to risk missing Focus Blast. Alternatively, Hidden Power Ice can be run to OHKO Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Magic Guard in tandem with Life Orb allows Alakazam to fire off powerful, boosted attacks without having to suffer Life Orb damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>First and foremost, Alakazam is very frail, so make sure that it's pivoted in via VoltTurn or free switches for the most part. However, Alakazam can be pivoted into special attackers like Toxapex. Make sure to scout for Choice Scarf users like Kartana that Alakazam normally beats before trying to take them on to prevent unnecessarily losing Alakazam early on in the match. Finally, it's usually best to prioritize attacking the foe over healing Alakazam unless there is a threat on the opposing team like Heatran that Alakazam needs to consistently pivot into throughout the match.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Defensive pivots like Toxapex and Ferrothorn should be used alongside Alakazam to make up for its mediocre defensive capabilities as well as for their ability to provide Alakazam with a defensive Pokemon to fall back to if they lose momentum. Offensive Pokemon like Heatran and Garchomp that can break through bulky Steel-types like Magearna that give Alakazam trouble make great teammates for Alakazam due to their excellent offensive synergy with it.

  "Golem-Alola": {
    "overview": "<p>At face value, Alolan Golem seems to be completely outclassed by Magnezone in terms of trapping Steel-types, but it finds its niche because it has several distinct advantages over Magnezone. Alolan Golem's access to Earthquake gives it the ability to trap Steel-types Magnezone can't, such as Magearna, Excadrill, other Magnezone, and most notably Heatran. Alolan Golem can also trap nearly everything Magnezone can as well, with the unfortunate exception of Kartana. With Alolan Golem being a physical attacker and having a unique Rock / Electric typing, it can check Pokemon Magnezone can't such as Zapdos. Unfortunately, Alolan Golem is still heavily overshadowed by Magnezone; Magnezone's ability to trap Kartana and check Tapu Lele, Toxapex, and Mega Pinsir are generally more useful than Alolan Golem's unique qualities. Alolan Golem is also largely useless after trapping Steel-types unlike Magnezone because it does not bring any other utility to the table. In fact, Alolan Golem can prove to be a liability after it has done its job, as many teams can easily take advantage of it with Pokemon like Landorus-T, Kartana, and Garchomp due to its poor defensive typing. Alolan Golem's Speed tier is rock bottom; it fails to outspeed anything faster than Jolly Landorus-T. Finally, while Alolan Golem's physical bulk is solid, it crumbles to most powerful special attacks due to its low Special Defense. This prevents it from switching into most of the Steel-types it needs to trap and nearly mandates Eject Button or VoltTurn support.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Volt Switch seems appealing to gain momentum, but it tends to fall flat in practice due to the fact that most teams have Ground-types and Alolan Golem isn't particularly threatening to many Pokemon. Toxic can be used to cripple Ground-types that try to switch into Alolan Golem.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Due to Alolan Golem's shallow movepool and typing, practically every Ground-type causes it problems in some way. Gastrodon, defensive Landorus-T, Quagsire, Mega Swampert, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Mega Garchomp all hard counter Alolan Golem due to their typings and bulk and can all easily OHKO it with their Ground-type STAB attacks. Offensive Landorus-T, Nidoking, Mega Camerupt, and Mamoswine all can take a hit and OHKO back.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Due to Alolan Golem's poor Speed, Pokemon like Kartana, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Medicham easily outrun Alolan Golem and OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Tangrowth all can easily switch into Alolan Golem and retaliate with Giga Drain. Kartana easily outspeeds Alolan Golem and OHKOes it with Leaf Blade. Tapu Bulu can also take a hit with ease and OHKO Alolan Golem with Horn Leech.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon: Pokemon like Clefable, Chansey, Mew, and Mega Sableye wall Alolan Golem with ease and simply stall it out.</p> ",

Earthquake is used to trap Heatran, weakened Assault Vest Magearna, Magnezone, Jirachi, and Excadrill. Fire Punch allows Alolan Golem to trap Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn. The last moveslot is mostly filler. Explosion can be used to deal a high amount of damage and gain momentum; losing Alolan Golem isn't a big deal due to its lack of utility after trapping Steel-types. Stealth Rock can be used for role compression and to give Alolan Golem utility after trapping Steel-types. Stone Edge can also be used to allow Alolan Golem to check Zapdos.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Alolan Golem's power and gives it enough Speed to outrun Jolly Landorus-T thanks to Alolan Golem's Choice Scarf. Choice Scarf is used to allow Alolan Golem to outspeed Heatran, defensive Jirachi, and non-Choice Scarf Excadrill. Magnet Pull is mandatory to trap Steel-types.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Unless it is absolutely needed, do not directly switch Alolan Golem into the Steel-types it needs to trap, as it can not switch into most of them. Try to come in after a sacrifice or from a teammate's U-turn or Volt Switch. The best case scenario is to try to use Eject Button users like Toxapex and Alomomola to bring Alolan Golem in safely. Do not try to trap Magearna until it is sufficiently weakened; the same goes for Excadrill and Ferrothorn. After trapping Steel-types, feel free to sacrifice Alolan Golem, as letting in Ground-types such as Landorus-T can make Alolan Golem a liability to its team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>In order for Alolan Golem to not be outclassed by Magnezone, pair Alolan Golem with Pokemon that appreciate having Magnezone, Jirachi, Heatran, and Magearna removed. Pokemon such as Tapu Lele, Kartana, Serperior, and Volcarona are excellent partners for this reason. Defensive Steel-types such as Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn appreciate Alolan Golem trapping Magnezone and Heatran. Alolan Golem appreciates VoltTurn support to get in safely against the Steel-types it needs to trap. Tornadus-T, Assault Vest Magearna, and Landorus-T make great choices for this role. Eject Button users like Toxapex and Alomomola can also help to bring Alolan Golem in safely. Due to Alolan Golem's inability to trap Kartana, an answer to Kartana such as Amoonguss, Tornadus-T, or Zapdos is appreciated. Finally, since Alolan Golem invites in practically every Ground-type in the tier for free, make sure to have solid counterplay to them. Clefable, Tapu Bulu, and Landorus-T are all good examples.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Slowbro is capable of checking or countering a large number of common, highly dangerous Pokemon including Hawlucha, Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, Keldeo, and non-Dark Pulse Greninja. Combined with its access to Regenerator and its access to a good utility move in STAB Scald, Slowbro functions as a solid pivot for bulky offensive and balanced teams. That said, Slowbro faces difficulty against a number of metagame trends, namely Ash-Greninja and Tapu Koko's prevalence, and is particularly susceptible to status. This is compounded by its cripplingly low Speed stat, which means that it will often find itself taking a hit before it can move, and its low Special Defense. Consequently, it is hard to justify using Slowbro as a bulky Water-type over options like Toxapex and Alomomola, which fare better versus Pokemon such as Ash-Greninja and have better mixed bulk.</p> ",

Magnezone is also faster and OHKOes Slowbro with Thunderbolt, but it needs to be careful of switching into Fire Blast. Mega Venusaur and Tangrowth both hit Slowbro super effectively on its lower Special Defense with STAB Giga Drain, although the latter needs to be careful of Fire Blast and neither can break through after a Calm Mind. Tapu Bulu deals heavy damage with Horn Leech or Wood Hammer, but it doesn't enjoy being burned by Scald and needs to be careful of Fire Blast. Ferrothorn pressures non-Fire Blast Slowbro with Leech Seed and Power Whip and can set up Spikes on it, although Slowbro can shrug it off decently after burning it and potentially Mega Evolving.</p> <p><strong>Ghost- and Dark-types: Gengar threatens to OHKO unboosted Slowbro with Shadow Ball, but it can't switch into Psychic or Psyshock and still takes a lot of damage from Scald.

Manaphy sets up in Slowbro's face and breaks through it with Energy Ball. Volcarona doesn't appreciate Scald before setting up Quiver Dances, but it can hit Slowbro hard with Bug Buzz. Mega Charizard Y summons sun and nails Slowbro with Solar Beam. Heatran traps Slowbro with Magma Storm and can OHKO it with Bloom Doom. Mamoswine can deal heavy damage with Freeze-Dry.</p> <p><strong>Status: Slowbro is very susceptible to status because it forces it to use Slack Off more than it wants to, preventing it from setting up Calm Minds to sweep. This means that it can't afford to take moves like Toxic and can be very easily pressured if poisoned by Gunk Shot or Sludge Bomb. Toxic Spikes also put pressure onto Slowbro's team because they need to be cleared before Slowbro can come in safely.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is used for its secondary burn chance, which potentially cripples switch-ins like Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth. Ice Beam allows Slowbro to beat Garchomp and Hawlucha, two Pokemon that this set is supposed to beat, and hit Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth super effectively. Flamethrower is another alternative that allows Slowbro to hit opposing Steel-types, primarily Ferrothorn, Kartana, and Mega Scizor, for a big chunk of damage. Toxic is valuable for hitting Pokemon that don't take much damage from Scald or Ice Beam, such as Tangrowth, Greninja, and Mega Alakazam, on an expected switch. Thunder Wave can be used over Toxic if the team prefers the additional speed control, hindering fast Pokemon like Mega Alakazam, Serperior, and Greninja. Protect can be used in the last slot to scout against opposing Pokemon like Greninja, Ash-Greninja, and Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar and gain additional recovery from Leftovers.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>96 Defense EVs with a Bold nature hit a jump point. The rest is dumped into Special Defense to pivot in on special attackers like Mega Alakazam and Protean Greninja, and it ensures Dark Pulse from Choice Specs Greninja never KOes from full HP. Regenerator allows Slowbro to function as an effective pivot, allowing it to repeatedly switch into strong physical attackers like Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham without losing momentum to recover via Slack Off every time. Slowbronite is an option that improves Slowbro's stats if its team doesn't already have another Mega Stone user.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Avoid Toxic from Pokemon such as Heatran, Gliscor, and Toxapex, as this will severely hinder Slowbro's longevity throughout the match. Toxapex can also cripple Slowbro with Toxic Spikes, so make sure that they're removed from the field before bringing Slowbro in. Slowbro doesn't appreciate taking a Knock Off, as losing its Leftovers cripples its longetivity. Don't hesitate to click Scald even on predicted switches, as its 30% burn chance can cripple opposing Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Kartana, two Pokemon that can beat Slowbro easily if not burned. Use Toxic or Thunder Wave when the opponent has a Pokemon that would be more crippled by Toxic poison or paralysis than a burn, such as Mega Alakazam, Ash-Greninja, Tangrowth, and Tornadus-T. Use Protect against Pokemon that tend to be Choice locked and threaten Slowbro out, such as Ash-Greninja, Magnezone, and Tapu Lele, as them locking into the wrong move can give Slowbro the opportunity to fire off a free attack. It also alleviates prediction against Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar and Weavile. If running Slowbronite, you should not Mega Evolve with Slowbro early into the game, because it needs Regenerator to properly function as a defensive pivot; instead, Slowbro should Mega Evolve once its pivoting capabilities are no longer needed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Slowbro's defensive utility is beneficial for bulky offense and balance builds that tend to struggle switching into Pokemon like Heatran, Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Hawlucha. Ash-Greninja hard counters this set outside of a possible status move, so having a reliable answer for it is vital. Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth possess good defensive synergy with Slowbro and can usually handle Ash-Greninja outside of the rare Ice Beam or Gunk Shot, as well as Tapu Koko; Tangrowth also forms a Regenerator core with Slowbro. Heatran possesses good defensive synergy with Slowbro and can help against opposing Grass-types, such as Tapu Bulu, Tangrowth, Ferrothorn, and Serperior, that scare out Slowbro. Heatran also helps with Mega Scizor and Magearna, two Pokemon that could potentially use Slowbro as setup fodder. Toxapex hard walls this set and can badly poison Slowbro with Toxic or set up Toxic Spikes. Having teammates that can pressure Toxapex, primarily Psychic- and Electric- types like Mega Alakazam and Tapu Koko, is important for this set. Entry hazard removers are very helpful for Slowbro to ensure that it recovers as much HP as possible while pivoting and doesn't get poisoned or badly poisoned from Toxic Spikes. Tornadus-T deserves a special mention, as it can remove entry hazards, pressure Grass-types with Hurricane, and form a Regenerator core with Slowbro.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Alolan Muk acts as a decent special pivot with its high HP and Special Defense, allowing it to check threats such as Volcarona, Greninja, and Hoopa-U. This is compounded by its access to a STAB Pursuit, which allows Alolan Muk to effectively trap Pokemon such as Tapu Lele, Latios, and Mega Alakazam. Even when Alolan Muk is not using Pursuit, Poison Touch allows it to easily spread poison and cripple switch-ins. Also, Alolan Muk's Poison-typing is great for absorbing Toxic Spikes. However, Alolan Muk's passivity and weakness to physical attacks invites in powerful wallbreakers such as Mega Mawile, Landorus-T, and Tyranitar. Alolan Muk is also outsped by the majority of the tier, meaning it will almost always have to take a hit before moving.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Shadow Sneak seems like a viable option to fish for a last effort poison chance, but moves such as Fire Punch and Rock Slide are more useful overall. A RestTalk set with Curse and Knock Off can be used to sweep since it poisons some of its checks in Landorus-T and Mega Tyranitar early on, and it defeats Pokemon Alolan Muk's Assault Vest usually loses to such as Mega Venusaur and Mew. The prevalence of Toxapex makes it hard to fit on teams however.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor threaten Alolan Muk with their Ground-type STAB moves, take little damage from any of Alolan Muk's attacks, and can use Alolan Muk as setup fodder. They must be wary of Poison Touch, however.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Pokemon such as Toxapex, Mega Venusaur, Mega Tyranitar, Mega Sableye, and the aforementioned Landorus-T can switch in with little to no fear.</p> <p><strong>Magearna: Z-Move Magearna variants cannot have their item removed with Knock Off and easily set up on or KO Alolan Muk with a bit of prior damage or Z-Move use.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Knock Off is a powerful, spammable attack that carries the benefits of removing items and potentially poisoning targets. It also has the benefit of scouting Z-Crystals on Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Magearna. Pursuit traps and removes powerful Psychic- and Ghost-types such as Mega Alakazam, Latios, Tapu Lele, and Gengar. Poison Jab is a reliable STAB move and has a nice 51% poison chance when combined with Poison Touch. Rock Slide allows Alolan Muk to better check Volcarona and Mega Charizard Y and is preferred over Stone Edge for its higher accuracy. Fire Punch provides very valuable coverage against Steel-types that can use Alolan Muk as setup fodder, such as Mega Scizor, Magearna, and Kartana.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>28 Defense EVs allow Alolan Muk to avoid the 2HKO from Choice Band Hoopa-U's Hyperspace Fury. 248 HP investment in tandem with 192 Special Defense investment alongside a Careful nature allow Alolan Muk to avoid getting 2HKOed by Choice Specs Blacephalon's Fire Blast after Stealth Rock damage, as well as Mega Charizard Y's Flamethrower. Additionally, it also allows Alolan Muk to avoid being OHKOed by Savage Spin-Out from offensive Volcarona at +2. 4 Speed EVs enable it to outspeed Chansey. The rest of Alolan Muk's EVs are placed into Attack. Assault Vest increases Alolan Muk's special bulk even further while having little drawback due to Alolan Muk's poor support movepool. Poison Touch is the preferred ability, as the other two options are completely useless on this set.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Optimally, Alolan Muk should come in on a Psychic- or Ghost-type and proceed to trap and possibly KO it with Pursuit. While Alolan Muk does not take large amounts of damage from neutral special attacks, it is generally not recommended to switch Alolan Muk into them, as it has no form of recovery, and this wears it down quickly. Try to switch Alolan Muk in on attacks it resists or is immune to, such as Tapu Lele's Psychic and Gengar's Sludge Wave. In addition, Alolan Muk should generally avoid physical attackers due to its low Defense stat. If there is no reason to use any of Alolan Muk's other moves, Knock Off should be spammed due to its utility and lack of immunities.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Offensive Pokemon weak to Psychic and Ghost such as Keldeo and Nihilego enjoy Alolan Muk's ability to easily trap and eliminate Pokemon of these types. Fighting-type Pokemon in particular, such as Keldeo and Terrakion, can easily dispose of Steel-types while additionally acting as lures for Alolan Muk's Pursuit targets. Tapu Bulu is a great teammate for Alolan Muk, as it easily deals with Ground-type Pokemon while setting Grassy Terrain, which weakens Earthquake and provides Alolan Muk with a small amount of passive recovery. Magnezone can be utilized to help remove Steel-types, such as Mega Scizor and Celesteela. Magnezone should not be run just to help Alolan Muk, however, as its pivoting role does not require its checks and counters to be completely removed. Pokemon immune to Ground-type attacks such as Rotom-W and Landorus-T can use Alolan Muk's weakness to the type as a free switch in opportunity. Lastly, Wish users such as Alomomola, Clefable, and specially defensive Jirachi can pass Wishes to Alolan Muk to keep it healthy throughout the match.</p> "

  "Gengar": {
    "overview": "<p>By virtue of its high Special Attack and Speed stats, Gengar is an exceptional wallbreaker in the OU metagame. It can take advantage of the tier's general lack of Ghost-resistant Pokemon to fire off powerful STAB Shadow Balls while also pressuring the tier's myriad of Fairy-types thanks to its Poison typing. Gengar also has a decent amount of coverage and utility options at its disposal, including useful moves in Focus Blast, Thunderbolt, and Taunt. Unfortunately, Gengar is horribly frail and thus easily folds to faster Pokemon, Choice Scarf users, and priority, which are all quite common in OU. It also has trouble taking strong neutral hits because of this, and at times it over relies on KOing its foes as a result. Gengar's fragility can also limit its opportunities to switch in, which can prevent it from consistently wallbreaking. Lastly, Gengar is quite weak to Pursuit from the likes of Weavile and Tyranitar, which requires that it is played carefully in order to prevent it from being trapped and KOed.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Reflect Type is an option on the utility set for allowing Gengar to safely pivot out of Pursuit trappers. However, this is more often than not situational and won't be as consistently useful as Taunt or Focus Blast. Substitute is also an option for taking advantage of the switches Gengar forces and allowing it to more reliably fire off attacks, but it is also less useful than either Taunt or Focus Blast most of the time. A Choice Scarf set allows Gengar to function as a revenge killer and potential late-game cleaner, though the lack of power is quite noticeable and leaves it even more susceptible to bulky offensive threats that can stomach hits and smack it back with powerful moves. A Hex + Will-O-Wisp set heavily damages most foes after burning them, though it requires said foes to be burnt or at least statused in order for Gengar to do any notable damage with its Ghost-type STAB attacks and is usually not as useful as the main sets listed. Gengar has access to plenty of coverage moves that are potentially useful for surprising specific threats, such as Psychic, Dazzling Gleam, and Energy Ball. Unfortunately, it usually doesn't have room for these attacks due to the more valuable coverage or utility provided by moves like Taunt, Focus Blast, and Thunderbolt. Lastly, Gengar can make use of a plethora of different utility moves it has access to, such as Disable, Knock Off, Haze, and Icy Wind. However, all of these moves are generally too hard to find room for and are too situationally useful to justify being placed on sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Due to Gengar's extreme frailty, faster Pokemon in Mega Alakazam, Mega Lopunny, and Greninja can heavily threaten it with powerful STAB attacks. Choice Scarf users like Excadrill and Tapu Lele are also quite troublesome due to their ability to outrun and KO Gengar by virtue of their held items.</p> <p><strong>Strong Priority: Gengar's pitiful defenses make it fold to strong priority attacks like Mimikyu's Shadow Sneak, Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch, and Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Trappers: The likes of Weavile, Tyranitar, and Mega Scizor can easily take advantage of either outspeeding Gengar or resisting the attacks it's locked into to trap and remove it from play with Pursuit. Alolan Muk, while not particularly common, is especially troublesome, as it can tank any of Gengar's attacks and guarantee its removal as a result.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pokemon That Can Take a Hit: Offensive Pokemon that can stomach at least one of Gengar's attacks, like Mega Charizard X, Keldeo, and Garchomp, can all heavily threaten it due to their ability to OHKO it with STAB moves after taking a hit.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive Utility",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shadow Ball is a strong STAB attack that hits the majority of the tier for super effective or neutral damage. When Ghostium Z is activated, Shadow Ball turns into an immensely powerful Never-Ending Nightmare that Gengar can use to deliver a powerful blow to nearly any Pokemon in the tier. It notably OHKOes offensive variants of Landorus-T and Garchomp with just some prior damage. Sludge Wave is a good secondary STAB attack that hits foes neutral to Ghost, like Manaphy and Pelipper, harder than any of Gengar's other moves while also greatly damaging the likes of Tangrowth, Clefable, and Serperior. Taunt denies defensive Pokemon like Chansey, Amoonguss, and Toxapex of their status moves, which forces them to either switch out or be slowly worn down by Gengar's attacks. Focus Blast catches Tyranitar and Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Bisharp, Magnezone, and Heatran on the switch, OHKOing or 2HKOing them all. Will-O-Wisp can be used in the place of either Taunt or Focus Blast to shut down physical attackers slower than Gengar, such as Tyranitar, while also punishing foes that may try using Sucker Punch to KO Gengar, like Mega Mawile and Bisharp.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Full investment in Special Attack puts a considerable amount of power behind Gengar's attacks, while a Life Orb allows it to secure a few OHKOs that it otherwise wouldn't, such as the OHKO on Latios and Mew after Stealth Rock with Shadow Ball. Ghostium Z can be used over Life Orb if none of Gengar's teammates are utilizing Z-Crystals due to its massive damage output against a large portion of the metagame. As Shadow Ball has very few resists and immunities Metronome is an option to steadily boost its power for each consecutive use. Full investment in Speed with a Timid nature makes Gengar as fast as possible and gives it crucial Speed advantages over the likes of Keldeo, Kartana, and Mega Medicham. Cursed Body is Gengar's only possible ability, but it can come in handy against Choice-locked Pokemon that will be forced into either using Struggle or switching out.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Gengar should be brought in early-game in order to spam its STAB attacks and wear down the other team. This will often pave the way for a teammate's sweep due to the lack of Pokemon capable of easily stomaching Gengar's hits. In matchups against defensive or balanced teams, Gengar should look to come in on threats like Chansey and Toxapex. From there, it can cripple them with Taunt and proceed to wear them down without taking notable damage from any of their attacks. This set should be wary of staying in on threats that it can't OHKO from full health, such as Volcarona and Gyarados, as Gengar is incredibly frail. Because of said frailty, Gengar should also be wary about coming in on any attacks, which makes being brought in after a teammate has fainted or with support from a pivot optimal. Double switches and coming in on resisted attacks are also options, though these are both notably riskier.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Setup sweepers like Gyarados, Mega Tyranitar, and Landorus-T are appreciative of Gengar's ability to wear down opposing teams for them to clean up. They also enjoy Gengar's ability to prevent phazing and status moves with Taunt, as this allows for easier setup against most defensive Pokemon. Entry hazard support from teammates like Landorus-T, Jirachi, and Ferrothorn can allow Gengar to increase its damage output while also punishing switches. Pivot support from the likes of Assault Vest Magearna, Landorus-T, and Magnezone is also useful for safely bringing Gengar into play. Dark-type checks like Magearna, Keldeo, and Mega Lopunny can take on big threats to Gengar in Weavile, Bisharp, and Tyranitar, and in return, it can wear down opposing teams and adequately pressure Fairy-types for the latter two. Gengar also enjoys having powerful physical attackers like Mamoswine, Kyurem-B, and Mega Pinsir on its team due to their ability to adequately pressure specially defensive Pokemon that it often can't break on its own without using up a lot of PP.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shadow Ball is a powerful STAB attack that Gengar can spam quite well due to the tier's general lack of Ghost-resistant Pokemon. Sludge Wave hits Assault Vest Tangrowth, which otherwise walls Gengar, while also heavily damaging Fairy-types like Clefable and hitting Pokemon like Keldeo and Zapdos for more damage than any of Gengar's other moves. Focus Blast offers excellent coverage, nailing Pokemon that otherwise scoff at Gengar's STAB attacks, like Tyranitar, Bisharp, and Ferrothorn. Trick cripples defensive Pokemon that may attempt to come in on Gengar's attacks, such as Chansey, Gastrodon, and Amoonguss. Thunderbolt is Gengar's best way of damaging defensive Celesteela, which can otherwise come in on its attacks, and also damages other potential switch-ins in Toxapex, Mantine, and Assault Vest Tornadus-T. Hidden Power Ice is an option for the fourth moveslot as well for OHKOing Landorus-T and Garchomp.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Full investment in Speed with a Timid nature makes Gengar as fast as possible, allowing it to outrun the likes of Keldeo, Kartana, and Garchomp. Maximum investment in Special Attack with Choice Specs maximizes Gengar's damage output, thus turning it into a potent wallbreaker. Cursed Body is Gengar's only ability. However, if it activates, it can be useful in forcing Choice-locked foes to either use Struggle or switch out.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set functions as a wallbreaker that looks to pave the way for a teammate's sweep. However, Gengar can try using its high Speed to clean up late-game if the opposing team is weakened well enough. Because of its frailty, Gengar should be careful about switching in. It can usually get in on predicted double switches and attacks that it either is immune to or 4x resists, though it is often safer to bring Gengar into play with pivot support or after a teammate has fainted. Gengar's frailty should also prevent it from staying in on various threats, such as Garchomp and unboosted Volcarona, unless they've been weakened a bit, since these Pokemon are all capable of taking a hit and OHKOing Gengar or setting up in retaliation. Because Choice Specs locks Gengar into one move, it is important that this set is utilized with careful prediction. For example, if a foe like Tyranitar or Bisharp is predicted to switch in, Gengar should use Focus Blast to prevent them from either trapping it or receiving an opportunity to set up the next turn. Trick is especially important to use with careful prediction, as Gengar only has one opportunity to force a foe to hold Choice Specs. Chansey and Mantine are two examples of Pokemon that are often going to switch into Gengar, so if they are on the opposing team and are predicted to come into play, Trick should be used to cripple them by locking them into one move and, in Chansey's case, removing Eviolite.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Stealth Rock support from Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Garchomp, and Mega Diancie can punish Gengar's switches and allow it to secure KOs, such as the possible OHKO on Mega Latias with Shadow Ball and the 2HKO on Mantine with Sludge Wave. Spikes support from the likes of Greninja and Ferrothorn can also be useful for punishing typical switch-ins like Assault Vest Magearna. Pivots like Mega Scizor, Tapu Koko, and Magnezone are capable of safely bringing Gengar into play, which is quite useful due to its low defenses. Setup sweepers like Volcarona, Celesteela, and Magearna are greatly appreciative of Gengar's wallbreaking capabilities, as it can weaken opposing teams enough for them to sufficiently sweep. Physical attackers can aid Gengar in breaking past the special walls it struggles to deal with on its own. Examples include Tapu Koko, which is particularly useful for breaking past both Mantine and Chansey with its Z-Wild Charge set, and Bisharp, which can use Knock Off to remove Chansey's Eviolite. Fighting-types like Mega Medicham and Keldeo can also take on Chansey while pressuring the Dark-types that Gengar often fails to beat, and in return, Gengar can remove opposing Psychic- and Ghost-types for them. Fairy-types like Magearna and Tapu Lele can also check Dark-types for Gengar and enjoy its ability to lure in and remove the Steel-types that they can struggle against, like Heatran and Celesteela.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Alolan Marowak's offensive typing in conjunction with Thick Club gives it a strong niche on Trick Room teams as a wallbreaker. It is decently bulky, and its ability Rock Head allows it to fire off an incredibly strong Flare Blitz without repercussion. That said, the fact that Alolan Marowak is both grounded and weak to Stealth Rock means that it gets worn down quickly if it repeatedly switches in and out. This issue is further exacerbated by its low Speed, which means that Alolan Marowak usually must take a hit before dishing out damage outside of Trick Room, and its reliance on Thick Club means that it's very vulnerable to Knock Off. Furthermore, its Speed compounds its weaknesses to extremely common and dangerous types in Water, Dark, Ghost, Ground, and Rock.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Substitute eases prediction and allows Alolan Marowak to take advantage of passive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Chansey, and Clefable. It also prevents Alolan Marowak from potentially being revenge killed or Pursuit trapped. Low Kick is capable of OHKOing Tyranitar without a boost, is Alolan Marowak's best option to hit Hydreigon, and is also capable of OHKOing Heatran. That being said, it is mostly overshadowed by Bonemerang due to its ability to OHKO Toxapex at +2 (preventing potential unnecessary Scald damage) and Tyranitar unboosted, only really hitting the rare Hydreigon. Knock Off is capable of removing items, which can prove helpful in the long run versus Pokemon like Tapu Fini that are heavily dependent on their items to function. However, the coverage the move provides is completely redundant alongside Shadow Bone and Flare Blitz, restricting it to a utility option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Quagsire: Quagsire is not 2HKOed by Shadow Bone, resists Flare Blitz, and has Unaware, leaving Alolan Marowak unable to break through it with Swords Dance boosts. Quagsire threatens Alolan Marowak back with Earthquake or Scald, although Quagsire does need to be wary of switching in on Will-O-Wisp and can't switch into Alolan Marowak directly if even slightly weakened.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Landorus-T can fall back on Intimidate to soften up Alolan Marowak's attacks, and it OHKOes Alolan Marowak in return with Earthquake. Garchomp resists Flare Blitz, outpaces Alolan Marowak outside of Trick Room, and deals heavy damage with Earthquake. Hippowdon escapes the 2HKO from Shadow Bone and KOes Alolan Marowak with Earthquake after Stealth Rock damage; however, it must be wary of Flare Blitz, which almost always 2HKOes it after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Greninja is faster than Alolan Marowak and OHKOes it with Hydro Pump; in a similar vein, Ash-Greninja can OHKO Alolan Marowak with priority Water Shuriken even if Trick Room is up. Keldeo is also faster, and it OHKOes Alolan Marowak with Hydro Pump, Scald, or Surf. Tapu Fini threatens Alolan Marowak with Scald, Gyarados OHKOes it with Waterfall, and Mega Gyarados resists both of its STAB moves. Keep in mind that in Trick Room, Alolan Marowak outspeeds all of these things.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Tyranitar resists both of Alolan Marowak's STAB moves but must be wary of Bonemerang. It can either trap Alolan Marowak with Pursuit or OHKO it with Crunch or Stone Edge. Weavile also outpaces and can trap Alolan Marowak with Pursuit while also threatening it with STAB Knock Off; that said, it can't switch in on Alolan Marowak. Hoopa-U outpaces and nukes Alolan Marowak or a teammate with Hyperspace Fury or Dark Pulse, although it can't switch in. While extremely niche, Hydreigon resists or is immune to everything Alolan Marowak can throw at it barring the extremely rare Low Kick, and it OHKOes Alolan Marowak in return with Dark Pulse.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards: Alolan Marowak is weak to Stealth Rock and is grounded, meaning entry hazards wear it down very quickly.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shadow Bone is the move that Alolan Marowak will use the most, taking good advantage of the lack of bulky Pokemon that resist Ghost in the tier to OHKO or 2HKO the vast majority of the metagame. Flare Blitz 2HKOes nearly everything that doesn't resist it if Stealth Rock is on the field, including physically defensive Landorus-T. This also improves Alolan Marowak's stall matchup in a few ways, allowing it to beat physically defensive Clefable without draining a large amount of Shadow Bone PP in the process, guaranteeing an OHKO versus Mega Sableye after a Swords Dance, and OHKOing Chansey at +2, preventing it from putting Alolan Marowak on a timer with Toxic. Swords Dance makes tearing through bulkier teams a piece of cake, allowing Alolan Marowak to beat Toxapex if Swords Dance is used as Toxapex switches into it. Bonemerang is a solid coverage option for Alolan Marowak, OHKOing Heatran and Tyranitar, and allowing it to beat Toxapex one-on-one. Because Bonemerang hits twice, it has the added bonus of being able to punish Heatran behind a Substitute.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in Attack along with a Brave nature allows Alolan Marowak to hit as hard as possible and minimizes its Speed for when it is under Trick Room. Maximum HP investment allows it to take as many hits as possible before going down. Thick Club doubles Alolan Marowak's Attack stat, which allows it to hit 568 Attack before a Swords Dance. Rock Head allows Alolan Marowak to use Flare Blitz without the nasty recoil that it would otherwise entail.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Ensure that Stealth Rock and Spikes are off of the field whenever possible to avoid wearing Alolan Marowak down and use its resistances to offensively check Pokemon such as Mega Medicham and Magearna. Avoid switching in directly unless it is absolutely necessary or you know that Alolan Marowak is immune to what its foe is about to use. If you expect a U-turn, don't use Alolan Marowak to absorb it because that is only conducive to wearing it down. Flare Blitz should be used most of the time unless facing a team with solid Fire-type switch-ins, where Shadow Bone should be used instead. Swords Dance should typically be used on predicted switch-ins, but make sure whatever you predict to come in will be OHKOed by Alolan Marowak after a Swords Dance. All in all, just take advantage of any free switch-ins Alolan Marowak is able to get because it will almost invariably result in an opposing Pokemon being severely dented or KOed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Alolan Marowak should rarely be used outside of dedicated Trick Room teams because otherwise it faces heavy competition from other wallbreakers. With Trick Room support, however, Alolan Marowak is able to outspeed most of the metagame and is much harder to revenge kill. Trick Room setters such as Uxie and Cresselia are mandatory; Uxie supports Alolan Marowak with Memento and Stealth Rock, while Cresselia can use Lunar Dance to heal Alolan Marowak back up to full health later on in the match. It also pairs well with other offensive Trick Room Pokemon such as Crawdaunt, Magearna, and Mega Mawile, all of which can break down each other's checks and counters and pave the way for a sweep.</p> "

  "Chansey": {
    "overview": "<p>Chansey's monstrous HP and high Special Defense stats make it the bulkiest special wall in the tier, boasting the ability to reliably handle the majority of the special attackers that the OU tier has to offer. To further accentuate its defensive prowess, Chansey has access to a plethora of viable utility moves such as Stealth Rock, Toxic, Thunder Wave, and Heal Bell, which makes it a must on almost all stall teams. On the flipside, while Chansey's measly Defense stat is covered for by its gargantuan HP stat combined with heavy EV investment, Chansey is still overwhelmed by physical attackers with setup moves such as Swords Dance Landorus-T and Kartana. Chansey's defensive typing is also interesting; while a Normal typing grants it only a single weakness, it also means Chansey has no resistances and only a single immunity. Furthermore, as is the case for many defensive Pokemon, Chansey is relatively slow and somewhat passive, relying heavily on Seismic Toss or status moves in order to inflict damage, meaning it can be relatively easily exploited by a number of offensive Pokemon. Lastly, Chansey is heavily reliant on Eviolite, as without it, Chansey is significantly less bulky and greatly struggles to check some of the more powerful offensive threats that it is usually tasked to handle.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>An EV spread of 4 HP / 252 Def / 252 SpD can be used to maximize Chansey's mixed bulk, enabling it to better handle special attacking threats such as Nasty Plot Thundurus and Calm Mind Tapu Koko. Confide can be run if Chansey's team desires the ability to handle Calm Mind sweepers like Blacephalon, Magearna, and Mega Latias.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Gliscor: Gliscor can switch in for free on Chansey and use it as setup fodder or as an opportunity to set up or remove Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Physical Fighting-types such as Mega Medicham, Mega Gallade, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Heracross all threaten to OHKO Chansey or do massive amount of damage with their respective Fighting-type STAB moves. Keldeo is also worth mentioning because Secret Sword targets Chansey's physical defense stat.</p> <p><strong>Physical Wallbreakers: While Chansey's poor defense stat is remedied with heavy investment and Eviolite, strong physical breakers can still muscle through it quite effectively. Some examples include Landorus-T, Mega Mawile, Tapu Bulu, Choice Band Tyranitar, Swords Dance Garchomp, and Kyurem-B.</p> <p><strong>Losing Eviolite: The removal of Eviolite is a big problem for Chansey, severely diminishing its bulk, which makes it far tougher for it to handle many of the offensive threats that it would usually be able to deal with. Knock Off users such as Clefable, Tornadus-T, and Alomomola can lure Chansey in and remove its Eviolite. Trick users such as Latios, Gengar, and Hoopa-U can be even more devastating, as not only do they remove Chansey's Eviolite, but they also lock it into a single move, which heavily limits its effectiveness.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users: Seismic Toss is Chansey's only attacking move, meaning that most of its moveset is useless if it gets Taunted, making it near impossible for Chansey to perform its role effectively.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Toxic cripples and wears down Pokemon that try to use Chansey as setup fodder or can outlast its Seismic Toss. Stealth Rock chips away at all Pokemon without Magic Guard and is a staple for every team. Chansey is an especially effective Stealth Rock user, as its ability to reliably handle almost every special attacker gives it ample opportunities throughout a game to set up the entry hazard. If Stealth Rock has already been accounted for, Chansey can opt to run Heal Bell instead, providing cleric support to its teammates. This option is most commonly found on stall teams without Heal Bell Clefable. Alternatively, moves like Wish or Thunder Wave can be run to provide different kinds of team support.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Near Maximum HP and Defense investment allows Chansey to best handle mixed attackers such as Greninja and Kyurem-B and Psyshock users such as Tapu Lele, Hoopa-U, and Latios. Natural Cure rids Chansey of any status ailment it may be suffering from when it switches out, ensuring that Chansey isn't worn down by Scald burns or Toxic damage. If Chansey runs Thunder Wave, it'll want to run 16 Speed EVs to outspeed paralyzed Heatran.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Chansey requires near full health in order to reliably deal with powerful special attackers such as Mega Charizard Y, so make sure Chansey is recovering often in order to remain healthy throughout the duration of the match. Be wary of Knock Off, as Eviolite is what allows it to be the powerful defensive threat that it is. There are a wide number of Pokemon such as Clefable, Mega Venusaur, Tangrowth, Tornadus-T, and Alomomola that utilize Knock Off for defensive utility. Try not to switch to Chansey in situations such as these until you are confident that it is safe to do so.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Sableye is one of the best partners for Chansey, as it is able to bounce back entry hazards and Taunt while also providing a switch-in to Knock Off. Mega Sableye also checks some of the bigger threats to Chansey such as Mega Medicham and Gengar. Unaware walls such as Clefable and Quagsire ensure that Chansey's team will not be overwhelmed by boosted threats such as Swords Dance Landorus-T and Gliscor. Hazard removal from Pokemon such as Skarmory, Zapdos, and Mantine is highly useful when supporting Chansey, making up for Chansey's lack of passive recovery by ensuring that it does not take much in the way of hazard damage.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its naturally high Attack, access to Swords Dance, and great ability in Aerilate, Mega Pinsir can act as a dangerous wallbreaker in the metagame. Aerilate-boosted priority in Quick Attack lets Mega Pinsir function as a pretty effective revenge killer that is able to pick off threats like Volcarona and weakened Serperior. Also, Mega Pinsir's Speed tier gives it an edge over other, slower wallbreakers like Mega Medicham, Mega Mawile, and Mega Heracross. Unfortunately, Mega Pinsir's defensive typing is terrible, giving it a 4x weakness to Stealth Rock. The omnipresence of Zapdos, Rotom-W, Tapu Koko, and Celesteela makes Mega Pinsir further struggle in the metagame not only because they take advantage of Mega Pinsir's typing but also because Mega Pinsir can't run all the coverage moves necessary to hit them super effectively. Additionally, while Mega Pinsir's Speed tier isn't bad, it leaves Mega Pinsir outpaced by common threats like Tornadus-T and Greninja. Because of these factors, Mega Pinsir requires a lot of support to function properly and is heavily outclassed by other wallbreakers like Mega Mawile, Garchomp, and Mega Medicham.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Earthquake can be used over Close Combat to hit Steel-types like Magearna and Jirachi harder as well as KO Tapu Koko on the switch. However, being unable to hit Rotom-W and Celesteela is undesirable. Feint has merit over Quick Attack in outprioritizing Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken, but Feint's damage output is worse, making Mega Pinsir a less effective revenge killer.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Pokemon like Rotom-W and Tapu Koko are capable of eating Mega Pinsir's STAB moves and scare it off with their super effective STAB moves. However, the former can be chipped down by repeated Close Combats, while the latter must be wary of Earthquake on the switch. Zapdos is an especially notable counter to Mega Pinsir because it threatens Mega Pinsir with a possible paralysis from Static and fears only the rare Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: The likes of Celesteela, Magearna, and Jirachi resist Mega Pinsir's STAB moves but don't enjoy taking a Close Combat or, if not named Celesteela, Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats</strong>: Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Greninja outpace Mega Pinsir and can deal heavy damage to it, though they can't switch into Mega Pinsir directly. Also, Mega Pinsir inflicts much damage on them with a boosted Quick Attack.</p> <p><strong>Psychic Terrain: Offensive teams featuring Tapu Lele are very troublesome for Mega Pinsir, as Psychic Terrain prevents it from using Quick Attack against grounded targets.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance enables Mega Pinsir to pose a threat to opposing defensive backbones and clean up weakened slower teams. Quick Attack lets Mega Pinsir be a revenge killer and eases its matchup against faster teams, dealing with threats like Mega Alakazam and Mega Lopunny at +2. Close Combat means that Steel- and Rock-types like Celesteela, Heatran, Magearna, and Tyranitar as well as Rotom-W aren't untouchable for Mega Pinsir.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Hyper Cutter is the pre-Mega ability of choice because it allows Mega Pinsir to bypass Intimidate on the turn it Mega Evolves. A Jolly nature is preferred to Adamant because outpacing the likes of Garchomp and Tapu Lele is more valuable than additional firepower.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Pinsir's primary task is to soften up opposing defensive backbones early- to mid-game. Early-game, just attacking with Mega Pinsir without setting up may be useful to chip down its defensive answers like Rotom-W and Celesteela into range of Mega Pinsir's boosted attacks. If Pokemon that are faster than Mega Pinsir are weakened enough to be in range of boosted Quick Attack, be mindful of scenarios where Mega Pinsir can pick up a Swords Dance boost and clean up the opposing team. Don't set up with Mega Pinsir if there are Pokemon on the opposing team that pose an immediate threat to it, such as Zapdos and Tapu Koko. You should play aggressively against opposing Stealth Rock setters in order to keep said entry hazard off your side of the field for Mega Pinsir. Note that Mega Pinsir is very vulnerable to getting chipped down because of its horrible defensive typing, so try to bring it in through aggressive double switches, via Volt Switch and U-turn, or on Pokemon that are easy to take advantage of, such as Tangrowth and Kartana locked on Leaf Blade.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Due to its nature, Mega Pinsir fits best on fast offensive teams that enjoy its wallbreaking capabilities and can give it proper support. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Tapu Fini, and Landorus-T is mandatory alongside Mega Pinsir due to its weakness to Stealth Rock. Moreover, two Defog users are frequently seen on Mega Pinsir builds. Mega Pinsir appreciates teammates such as Rockium Z Garchomp and Rockium Z Landorus-T that can break its answers like Zapdos and Celesteela down. Landorus-T can also run Defog to further help Mega Pinsir. Magnezone is a great partner to Mega Pinsir because it traps and eliminates Celesteela and Ferrothorn, getting off some pressure from Mega Pinsir. Additionally, Magnezone can draw in bulky Grass-types, which Mega Pinsir easily takes advantage of. Other Pokemon that tend to invite in bulky Grass-types, such as the aforementioned Rotom-W and Tapu Fini as well as Ash-Greninja, make for good partners to Mega Pinsir too. Mega Pinsir can also fit on hyper offensive teams, especially Sticky Web-based ones. As such, suicide leads like Excadrill, Greninja, Ribombee, and Araquanid are good teammates for Mega Pinsir on this archetype, as they set up hazards that help Mega Pinsir do its job more effectively. Excadrill is an especially notable suicide lead to pair with Mega Pinsir because it provides hazard control in the form of Rapid Spin.</p> "

It also has two extremely useful abilities in Moxie and Intimidate, which can allow it to snowball and aid it in setting up, respectively. Gyarados's decent bulk and good defensive typing provide it multiple setup opportunities and let it take hits from premier Pokemon in the tier such as Protean Greninja as well as Mega Swampert. However, Gyarados is hurt by its lackluster Speed tier, with Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Kyurem-B outspeeding it before a boost and most common Choice Scarf users and ultra-fast Pokemon like Mega Alakazam outspeeding it after a boost. Gyarados can also run a Mega set, which is notably trickier for some Choice Scarf users such as Garchomp to revenge kill, but it struggles with the prevalence of checks like Tangrowth and Toxapex.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A bulky Dragon Dance set with Leftovers and Substitute and Bounce is an option to set up more easily and avoid being revenge killed by Choice Scarf users, as well as giving it some form of recovery. Stone Edge is another option on regular Gyarados to give it coverage to hit Zapdos. Other Z-Crystals like Waterium Z and Groundium Z are also usable on Gyarados. Groundium Z Gyarados can OHKO Toxapex and take out Steel-types like Magearna without a boost. However, both are reliant on a multi-turn attack to bypass Grass-types in Bounce, and Waterium Z sets also compound Gyarados's issue with Water-types.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types, such as Zapdos, Tapu Koko, and Rotom-W are among Gyarados's most solid answers due to their ability to take on both Supersonic Skystrike and Mega variants. However, if running Earthquake, Mega Gyarados can hit Rotom-W through Levitate.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types like Tapu Fini, Toxapex, Keldeo, and Azumarill can beat Mega Gyarados comfortably, except for Earthquake sets for Rotom-W and Toxapex, and can threaten to KO it with their secondary STAB attack, remove Dragon Dance boosts with Haze, or burn Gyarados. While Supersonic Skystrike sets can punish Tapu Fini, non-Choice Scarf Keldeo, and Azumarill, these targets can often scout for it too.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Faster Pokemon like Mega Alakazam and Choice Scarf Keldeo, Garchomp, Greninja, Latios and Terrakion can outspeed Flyinium Z Gyarados even after a Dragon Dance and can do massive damage to or OHKO it. Choice Scarf Terrakion, Choice Scarf Keldeo, and Focus Blast Mega Alakazam can revenge kill Mega sets.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types like Tangrowth, Ferrothorn, Tapu Bulu, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss can all take on Mega Gyarados and threaten it with super effective STAB attacks, but all of them do have to be careful around Supersonic Skystrike and scout for it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Bulky Steel-types like Magearna, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Mega Mawile, and Magnezone can be annoying if Gyarados does not carry Earthquake for Magearna, Mega Mawile, and Magnezone or Taunt for Skarmory.

Bounce works in tandem with Flyinium Z to give Gyarados access to a 160-Base Power STAB attack in Supersonic Skystrike to hit Tangrowth, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss, as well as doing massive damage to bulky Water-types. Waterfall hits popular physically defensive Pokemon like Landorus-T for super effective damage and gives Gyarados good neutral coverage. Earthquake is a solid option on Gyarados, as it gives it the capability to hit Toxapex, Magnezone, Mega Mawile, and Magearna for super effective damage. Taunt helps Gyarados deal with Celesteela, Mew, Unaware Clefable, Skarmory, and Toxapex by blocking Leech Seed, Will-O-Wisp, recovery moves, and phazing; however, Gyarados still has to be wary of Scald burns from Toxapex. Gyarados can also use Substitute to avoid being statused by moves like Lava Plume and Scald while still being protected from Will-O-Wisp and Leech Seed, as well as making it harder for Choice Scarf users to revenge kill it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Gyarados's power and speed, and a Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed offensive Adamant Landorus-T before a boost and Tapu Koko after a boost. Moxie allows Gyarados to snowball after a KO, and it works well with Supersonic Skystrike, which can easily get a KO due to its great power. Flyinium Z allows Gyarados to use a 160-Base Power move in Supersonic Skystrike for one turn, which gives it coverage on Grass-types like Tangrowth and helps it do massive damage to opposing Pokemon. Waterium Z Gyarados can OHKO defensive Zapdos after Stealth Rock with +1 Hydro Vortex, OHKO fast Zapdos without Stealth Rock, and break past Steel-types like Magearna, Mega Mawile, and Magnezone without having to run Earthquake, although this leaves it unable to reliably break through Grass-types.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set can be used either to soften up walls early-game or to clean late-game. If Gyarados's main role is as an early-game breaker, it can afford to take some damage early on and also can use Supersonic Skystrike aggressively to soften down Pokemon for a teammate. Gyarados can also bluff a Mega set and lure in Grass-types like Tangrowth and take them out for a teammate. If Gyarados is being used as a late-game cleaner, try to avoid letting it taking chip damage, especially from Stealth Rock, as it can decrease its setup opportunities or leave it susceptible to a revenge killer. Gyarados should set up on Pokemon that cannot threaten it, such as defensive Landorus-T lacking Stone Edge, Mega Scizor, and Choice-locked Pokemon like Choice Specs Keldeo locked into Secret Sword. You should also be wary of Choice Scarf users and try to remove them before setting up, since they could interfere with a Gyarados sweep.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Gyarados struggles against defensive Electric-types like Zapdos, so it fits well with Pokemon that can wear them down, such as Mega Pinsir, and Pokemon that can pressure them, such as Tyranitar and Latios. Latios also provides entry hazard control, as do Mega Scizor and Mew, which is appreciated because Stealth Rock can wear Gyarados down. Mega Scizor can also pivot Gyarados into Pokemon like Heatran, which it can set up on, while Mew can spread burns to ease setting up for Gyarados. Latias can also be used instead of Latios to offer Gyarados Healing Wish support.</p> <p>Stealth Rock and Spikes support can help Gyarados, as the residual damage can often wear down common checks like Toxapex, Choice Scarf users, and Tapu Koko into the KO range of a +1 hit. Taunt Gyarados can also help the hazard setters by preventing most Defoggers bar Zapdos from removing the hazards. Ferrothorn and Spikes Greninja can both fit well with Gyarados, as Ferrothorn can check most Electric-types bar Magnezone, while Spikes Greninja can work with Gyarados to weaken Steel-types. Stealth Rock setters like Landorus-T, Mew, and Clefable are also good options.</p> "

Crunch is a strong primary STAB move that gives Gyarados good neutral coverage and hits Psychic-types such as Mew, Latios, and Slowbro super effectively. Earthquake hits Magearna, Toxapex, Mega Mawile, Tapu Koko, Magnezone, and Rotom-W harder than anything else without a boost, while hitting Keldeo and Tapu Fini for neutral damage. Substitute lets Mega Gyarados dodge Leech Seed and Will-O-Wisp and further allows Mega Gyarados to avoid status from moves like Lava Plume and Scald, making it easier for it to set up, and helps it avoid being revenge killed. Taunt is an alternative that allows Gyarados to avoid Haze and phazing from Toxapex and Skarmory, prevents Celesteela from getting residual damage through Leech Seed, and works with Mold Breaker to avoid Will-O-Wisp from Mega Sableye. Waterfall is an option that hits Ground-types like Landorus-T for super effective damage and hits certain Dark-resistant Pokemon like Clefable for neutral damage. Ice Fang is another option that does more damage than Crunch to bulky Grass-types like Tapu Bulu, Amoonguss, and Mega Venusaur, while also hitting Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor harder, so it can be used alongside Earthquake over Waterfall to improve coverage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment allows Gyarados to hit as hard as possible, while maximum Speed investment and a Jolly nature allow it to outspeed Tapu Koko after a Dragon Dance. Intimidate allows Gyarados to check Pokemon like Weavile and generates setup opportunities. Gyaradosite allows Gyarados to Mega Evolve into Mega Gyarados.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Gyarados should set up only after its checks like Toxapex, Zapdos, Tangrowth, and Tapu Fini have been removed or weakened into the range of its attacks at +1, and it should aim to set up on Pokemon that cannot threaten it, such as defensive Landorus-T, Garchomp Choice-locked into Earthquake, Battle Bond Greninja, Heatran if carrying Substitute, and specially defensive Celesteela if carrying Taunt or Substitute. It is best to avoid taking chip damage early on, as doing so can reduce Gyarados's setup opportunities late-game; keeping Stealth Rock off the field helps in that respect. Being careful about the timing of Mega Evolving with Gyarados can also help, as holding off on doing so allows Gyarados to set up on Pokemon like Garchomp locked into Earthquake and Keldeo locked into Secret Sword. On the other hand, Mega Evolving allows Gyarados to take neutral damage from Stealth Rock and gives it a Psychic immunity and Dark resistance, which is useful for taking on Choice-locked Psychic-types like Tapu Lele and Latios and Battle Bond Greninja.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Gyarados fits well with Pokemon that can lure common checks to it like Tangrowth, Toxapex, and Zapdos. Protean Greninja with Extrasensory works extremely well, as it can lure in Toxapex and nail Tangrowth on the switch by bluffing Battle Bond. Pokemon that can pressure the aforementioned checks are also good partners. Three attacks defensive Zapdos can pressure Toxapex and Tangrowth, as well as Steel-types like Mega Scizor, and it can help with Tapu Fini. Mega Gyarados is aided by Pokemon that heavily pressure offensive teams, which it sometimes struggles to deal with, such as offensive Shift Gear Magearna, which can punish checks to Gyarados with Thunderbolt, especially with an Electrium Z.</p> "

Ditto also provides team support by scouting movesets.</p> <p>In OU, Ditto is best suited for bulky teams as an anti-setup, anti-offense, and anti-stall option. However, because Ditto is forced to run Choice Scarf to avoid Speed ties, it has trouble with defensive setup Pokemon like Calm Mind Clefable and Reuniclus. Ditto can also be difficult to bring in safely against offensive teams due to its low HP stat and the likely low bulk and high offensive stats of the Pokemon it seeks to revenge kill. Additionally, Imposter and Transform are blocked by Substitute, leaving Ditto and its team vulnerable against setup sweepers that utilize said move, such as Serperior and Mega Gyarados.</p> ",

It will likely not see use—Imposter will usually transform Ditto immediately upon switch in, and an otherwise untransformed Ditto is extremely frail and can be easily OHKOed—but it is required for a valid set.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Imposter lets Ditto immediately transform into its foe upon switch in and is what gives Ditto its viability. Without Imposter, Ditto would be extremely slow and vulnerable while it wastes a turn to use Transform. Choice Scarf is used to avoid Speed ties. Unless the foe is also holding a Choice Scarf, Ditto will outspeed it and be able to act as a revenge killer. Ditto copies all of its foe's stats except for HP; thus, 252 HP EVs are used to maximize Ditto's bulk. Since Ditto copies the majority of its foe's stats, its IVs are only relevant in three cases: determining its HP stat, determining its Hidden Power type, and in the rare mirror matchup. In a mirror matchup between two Ditto, the faster Ditto will Transform first and be left with 5 PP. A Pokemon cannot Transform into an already Transformed Pokemon, so the slower Ditto will retain all of its PP and will Struggle last. 0 Speed IVs with a Relaxed nature aim to create the slowest untransformed Ditto. 252 Defense EVs are used with the Relaxed nature to minimize the amount of damage taken from opposing Struggle, while 4 Attack EVs give a slight boost to the damage output of Struggle. 0 Speed IVs and 31 IVs in every other stat give Ditto Hidden Power Ice, allowing it to significantly damage defensive Landorus-T. 30 Special Attack, 30 Special Defense, and 1 Speed IV can be used for Hidden Power Ground, which allows Ditto to countertrap Magnezone.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Ditto to revenge kill offensive threats. Ditto can apply heavy pressure on opponents by copying their wallbreakers. Copying powerful Mega Evolutions, such as Mega Medicham and Mega Charizard Y, can be especially devastating, as the typical counterplay of revenge killing is made difficult by Ditto's Choice Scarf. Early-game, Ditto can be sent in or lead off with to scout movesets. Against stall teams, attempt to switch Ditto into Knock Off to have its Choice Scarf removed. Without Choice Scarf, Ditto has the freedom to switch moves and has its effective PP increased from 5 to 20, allowing it to PP stall when paired with teammates with Regenerator. Ditto can then proceed to counter Mega Sableye and copy cleric support and entry hazard removal.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>In OU, Ditto is best suited for bulky teams that need support versus offensive setup, offense, and stall teams. Since Ditto punishes setup, extremely bulky Pokemon like Chansey, which typically require setup to break through, can make very effective partners. Teammates with Regenerator such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss allow Ditto to PP stall defensive Pokemon. Entry hazard removal from Mew, Tapu Fini, Skarmory, or Zapdos keeps Ditto healthy throughout the course of a match. Pivots able to use U-turn and Volt Switch, such as Landorus-T, Magearna, and Rotom-W, are able to bring in Ditto safely. Pokemon able to handle Calm Mind users are appreciated; physical wallbreakers such as Hoopa-U are nice in this regard. Hoopa-U is also able to punish Substitute users with Hyperspace Fury. Entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Landorus-T can break opposing Focus Sash and potentially put defensive Pokemon in range of Ditto's attacks.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Good base stats and a nice defensive typing let Zapdos check many prominent threats like Kartana, Tornadus-T, and Sand Rush Excadrill. Two useful abilities in Static and Pressure further increase Zapdos's utility by either crippling contact attackers like Mega Medicham, Kartana, and Mega Lopunny or stalling out entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn and Clefable. In addition, great coverage options in Hidden Power Ice and Heat Wave prevent Zapdos from being fodder for common threats like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Ferrothorn. Unfortunately, the weakness to Stealth Rock cripples Zapdos's defensive capabilities and forces it to waste a turn on using Roost more often. Also, many common Pokemon have their ways to reliably beat Zapdos, like Garchomp with Continental Crush and Kartana with Swords Dance-boosted Breakneck Blitz.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>An Electrium Z set with Thunderbolt, Heat Wave, Hidden Power Ice, and Roost can be used, but it loses out on the defensive utility of Zapdos. Toxic can be used to cripple defensive Pokemon like Tangrowth, Mega Latias, and Gastrodon. However, Zapdos struggles to fit this move on its set. Chilan Berry enables Zapdos to beat Normalium Z Kartana but is useless outside of this matchup and is thus inferior to Leftovers and Rocky Helmet. In addition, Kartana's teammates like Tornadus-T can easily shut down this strategy with Knock Off.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-type Pokemon and Coverage: The likes of Tyranitar, Mega Diancie, Rockium Z Garchomp, and Rockium Z Landorus-T overwhelm Zapdos quickly with their super effective Rock-type moves. Tyranitar and Mega Diancie dislike paralysis, however, and Zapdos can potentially stall out Tyranitar's Stone Edge with Roost and Pressure, while Garchomp and Landorus-T are heavily threatened by Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Iсe-types: Kyurem-B and Weavile are capable of inflicting great damage on Zapdos with their Ice-type STAB options. However, these Pokemon hate being paralyzed, and Weavile also drops to Heat Wave.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Pokémon like Mega Latias, Mega Latios, Mega Charizard X, and Hydreigon take little from Zapdos's attacks and threaten it with super effective moves like Ice Beam or with naturally strong attacks. None of these Pokemon enjoy being paralyzed, however.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types are immune to Zapdos's Electric-type STAB moves and thus can switch in on it more freely. Gastrodon and Hippowdon are especially notable counters to Zapdos, since they can ignore any attack Zapdos throws out and cripple it with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attacks: Moves like Heatran's Inferno Overdrive and boosted Kartana's Breakneck Blitz heavily dent or even completely eliminate Zapdos.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey walls Zapdos because of its amazing special bulk and easily stalls it out.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Discharge is preferred to Thunderbolt thanks to the former's higher paralysis chance, which can potentially cripple Zapdos's common checks like Heatran and Tyranitar. Volt Switch is also a plausible option in this slot because it lets Zapdos pivot out from unfavorable matchups; however, it makes Zapdos unable to consistently beat threats like Hawlucha. Heat Wave hits Grass- and Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Kartana, Magearna, and Mega Scizor that take on Discharge rather comfortably. Defog can be used on more defensive teams alongside Pressure or if you can't fit any other Defog user on the team, but it forces Zapdos to give up its precious coverage. Hidden Power Ice complements Zapdos's other coverage moves, hitting Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, all of which otherwise set up Stealth Rock for free. Roost is mandatory to keep Zapdos healthy throughout the battle so it can consistently check threats like Tornadus-T and Kartana.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>72 Speed EVs ensure that Zapdos always outpaces Modest Heatran. A Timid nature could be used over Bold to outspeed the rare Timid Heatran, though. Leftovers improves Zapdos's survivability by slightly healing all the chip damage it receives. Rocky Helmet, on the other hand, chips down contact attackers like the aforementioned Kartana and Mega Medicham but makes Zapdos easier to wear down. Static threatens Pokemon that use contact moves, like Tornadus-T, Kartana, and Mega Medicham, with a possible paralysis, making them easier to deal with. Pressure, on the other hand, is used mainly on stall teams and helps stall out the opposing team. Pressure also synergizes well with Defog and lets Zapdos stall out entry hazards from Ferrothorn and the likes.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Zapdos's main task is to switch in on Pokemon it checks like Tornadus-T, Kartana, and Mega Scizor. Keep Zapdos healthy throughout the game by using Roost frequently so it can consistently check Pokemon Zapdos is supposed to. This is especially important if you run Rocky Helmet instead of Leftovers. Be wary of possible strong attacks and coverage options like Breakneck Blitz from Kartana that can heavily damage Zapdos. Discharge is usually a go-to move thanks to its chance of causing paralysis. Don't be afraid to predict if you're playing against Pokemon like Garchomp and Landorus-T that dislike taking Zapdos's coverage moves, though.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Zapdos fits on a lot of archetypes ranging from bulky offense to stall thanks to its ability to check many notable threats and general lack of passivity. Bulky Water- and Grass-types can form fairly sturdy defensive cores with Zapdos that can cover most prominent threats: Water-types like Tapu Fini and Gastrodon can deal with Heatran and appreciate Zapdos checking Grass-types like Kartana and Tapu Bulu, while Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu can act as a secondary checks to Ground-types and enjoy Tornadus-T being checked. Pokemon with a somewhat mediocre Speed tier such as Mega Medicham, Mega Mawile, and Tapu Lele appreciate foes being paralyzed by Zapdos. Zapdos also can potentially bring these Pokemon on the field via Volt Switch. Bulky Steel-types like Magearna and Mega Scizor can pivot into the likes of Tyranitar and Kyurem-B, which can easily beat Zapdos. Magearna also enjoys Zapdos's immunity to Ground.</p> "

An outstanding ability in Pressure in tandem with Substitute enables it to stall out would-be threats such as Tyranitar locked into Stone Edge and win the PP war most of the time. Its typing also lets it tackle a few other threats, namely Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Scizor. Nonetheless, Moltres's bulk is somewhat lackluster, especially since it can't afford to invest enough EVs into its defenses, which means it will often crumble to strong wallbreakers. Furthermore, if a skillful opponent manages to get up Stealth Rock against Moltres's team, its typing gets turned against it, putting huge pressure on Moltres.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>While Toxic, Will-O-Wisp, and Protect may seem tempting, Moltres really can't afford to forfeit any of the four moves on its main set, as all of them are imperative for its success on stall teams.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: While most Moltres teams have plenty of ways around Stealth Rock, if it goes up, it's extremely damaging for Moltres. Setters such as Mega Diancie and Mega Tyranitar can also force both Moltres and common partners responsible for entry hazard removal out.</p> <p><strong>Miscellaneous Wallbreakers: Wallbreakers with both enough power to take down Moltres and enough bulk to constantly switch into its Flamethrowers, most notably Tapu Lele, Hoopa-U, and Substitute + Calm Mind Blacephalon, can be immense threats not only to Moltres but usually to all of its team.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers: The likes of Volcarona, Garchomp, and Mega Latias can take advantage of Moltres's passiveness to get some boosts and pose somewhat of a threat to Moltres's teammates under the right conditions.</p> <p><strong>Status Ailments: Toxic poison completely cripples Moltres, and even regular poison can already be a nuisance. Thunder Wave from Clefable is also a pain for Moltres to deal with. Pokemon that can inflict said status and pressure Heal Bell users on Moltres's team can really cripple it.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Flamethrower is Moltres's most reliable attacking move, notably striking Mega Mawile, Tapu Bulu, and Excadrill. Substitute lets Moltres stall out foes such as Heatran, Tyranitar, Volcanion, and Kyurem-B while letting it dodge status moves like Thunder Wave and Toxic from Clefable and Heatran. Defog enables it to remove entry hazards against several setters that force Mega Sableye out, notably Excadrill, Clefable, and Heatran. Lastly, Roost keeps Moltres healthy, enabling it to consistently check the likes of Heatran and Clefable. Hidden Power Ground over Substitute is a potential option, but more often than not, the utility of Substitute is far preferred over Hidden Power Ground's quicker method of beating down Heatran.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The Speed EVs alongside a Timid nature let Moltres outrun Excadrill and Heatran, and the combination of HP and Defense EVs let it take a Thunder Punch from Mega Mawile at full health. Pressure is the optimal ability choice, enabling Moltres to PP stall foes effectively. Finally, Leftovers is key to provide passive healing and enable Moltres to use Substitute with less of a drawback.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Always switch Moltres into Stealth Rock setters it walls. Attempt to Defog after scouting for moves that could threaten it like Thunder Wave from Clefable, Toxic from Heatran, and Rock Tomb from Excadrill. If your opponent manages to get up Stealth Rock against Moltres's team, it's advisable to remove said entry hazard via a secondary Defogger before recklessly sending it in. Keep track of the PP of opposing Pokémon to know when Moltres will be able to fully PP stall them. For instance, if Calm Mind Clefable still has all of its Moonblast PP, it can beat Moltres one-on-one. Be careful of status ailments; Toxic Heatran or Thunder Wave Clefable could be annoying if your opponent can put enough pressure on your Heal Bell user. Try to pivot Moltres in when threats to stall such as Mega Mawile and Mega Heracross come in, as it can force them out with Flamethrower; however, scout for Thunder Punch on Mega Mawile, and be careful of the aforementioned move as well as Rock Blast from Mega Heracross. Likewise, pulling double switches not to let these two come in is a risky but also quite rewarding play.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Moltres mostly fits on stall due to the nature of its type and utility. Further entry hazard control is imperative alongside Moltres; secondary Defog users such as Zapdos and Gliscor are notable picks. The former also makes a deadly Pressure core that is very effective at PP stalling wallbreakers that can threaten stall otherwise. In a similar manner, Mega Sableye is also an outstanding pick, as it heavily appreciates Moltres taking on Clefable, Heatran, and Excadrill, thus creating a strong backbone of hazard prevention. Pyukumuku is a solid Unaware user that can ignore boosts from most setup sweepers as well as help Moltres out when it comes to PP stalling with Spite. Chansey is a solid pick for any stall team for its ability to blanket check nearly all special attackers in the tier. Lastly, physical walls like Hippowdon, Tangrowth, and Unaware Clefable can also help with physical attackers such as Tyranitar that can overcome Moltres. The aforementioned Clefable and Chansey can also provide Heal Bell support, which is important to rid Moltres of status aliments commonly run by Pokemon it’s supposed to check.</p> "

  "Dragonite": {
    "overview": "<p>Dragonite is a devastating sweeper with Supersonic Skystrike, capable of breaking through defensive staples like Clefable, Tapu Fini, Ferrothorn, and Gliscor after a Dragon Dance. It can select from great priority, additional coverage, and recovery to best fit its team. Dragonite's ability Multiscale gives it an easy time setting up, but Stealth Rock takes away both Multiscale's effect and a chunk of Dragonite's health, so Dragonite requires good support against entry hazards to function well, either through exerting intense offensive pressure or with an emergency spinner or Defogger. A subpar Speed tier leaves Dragonite easily revenge killed, especially if it's chipped while setting up or if its team is unable to damage revenge killers into the range of Extreme Speed. Additionally, once Supersonic Skystrike is burned, Fly can be played around, leaving Dragonite reliant on non-STAB coverage. Finally, Dragonite faces serious competition from Mega Charizard X and even Gyarados, with both being more consistent options. As a result, Dragonite finds itself relegated to hyper offensive teams, where even there it struggles to find a place by nearly mandating anti-hazard support, constraining its team's builds.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>An Adamant nature is an option to provide better rolls against bulky Magearna and guarantee OHKOs on Pokemon like Magic Guard Clefable with a boosted Supersonic Skystrike. It's also notable for requiring less chip damage to take out would-be revenge killers with Extreme Speed, but outspeeding the previously mentioned metagame-relevant threats is too important to give up, and the slight boost in damage output often isn't enough to make up for the drop in Speed. Fire Punch can be used to break through Celesteela as well as Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor without requiring the use of Supersonic Skystrike. Losing the additional power of Earthquake and Earthquake's ability to hit Heatran, Tyranitar, Tapu Koko, and Mega Diancie is too detrimental, so Fire Punch should be used over Extreme Speed. However, this leaves Dragonite helpless against Weavile and weakens its matchup against Choice Scarf Greninja, so it should only be used with partners that appreciate Celesteela being weakened like Tapu Lele and with solid answers to the revenge killers that Dragonite becomes weaker against. A set of Substitute, Roost, Dragon Dance, and Fly can be used with Leftovers. It can be effective if teammates spread Toxic around and is able to take advantage of Dragonite's usual weakness to status by setting Substitute, though it has limited PP and can struggle against common walls like Zapdos and Celesteela. Finally, because of Multiscale, a Weakness Policy set is an option, but even at +3 Attack, Dragonite misses OHKOs against many bulky Pokemon like Tapu Fini, Ferrothorn, and Clefable, since it lacks Supersonic Skystrike. This Dragonite set mandates a strong hazard game, both to protect Multiscale and to ensure that Dragonite's attacks will pick up their KOs. While it has potential, relying on your opponent's attacks to set up your sweeper or breaker means that Weakness Policy Dragonite will oftentimes find itself outclassed by more consistent options.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Stealth Rock takes a quarter of Dragonite's HP away and halves its bulk by breaking Multiscale. While a full health Dragonite can set up against nearly any Pokemon in the OU tier, a Dragonite after Stealth Rock damage can barely set up on anything.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos and Rotom-W</strong>: Both of these Pokemon can take a boosted Supersonic Skystrike, heal, and retaliate with detrimental status or a Hidden Power Ice in Zapdos's case.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: All status conditions are crippling to Dragonite. Along with annoying full paralysis chances, Dragonite's subpar Speed causes a wide range of Pokemon to outspeed it after paralysis. A +1 paralyzed Dragonite is outsped by defensive Landorus-T, Tyranitar, Tapu Fini, Magearna, and Zapdos, for instance. Burn breaks Multiscale and halves Dragonite's attack, leaving it relatively worthless as a breaker and making it difficult to try to accumulate multiple boosts. Toxic is probably the least detrimental status for Dragonite, but it still leaves it unable to sweep in many cases, relegating it to a purely wallbreaking role.</p> <p><strong>Landorus-T: Without Roost, Landorus-T can be extremely annoying for Dragonite. Landorus-T can negate its Attack boosts while breaking Multiscale with U-turn chip or threatening it with Hidden Power Ice. Additionally, many sets can set up Stealth Rock, and Choice Scarf sets can revenge kill it with Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Celesteela and Skarmory</strong>: Unless Dragonite is running Fire Punch, both Celesteela and the rarer Skarmory wall it hard and can chip it down. Dragonite can attempt to take advantage of Celesteela's poor damage output with Roost, but a mistimed Supersonic Skystrike will leave Dragonite essentially useless against Protect.</p> <p><strong>Unaware</strong>: Most Unaware walls are capable of inflicting status on Dragonite or severely damaging it, and none are OHKOed by Supersonic Skystrike, leaving Dragonite nearly helpless against them if they prioritize staying healthy.</p> <p><strong>Healthy Revenge Killers</strong>: Without enough chip damage, Dragonite will be unable to KO faster Pokemon with Extreme Speed, leaving it susceptible to Pokemon like Weavile and Protean Greninja depending on how much it's boosted.</p> ",

        "name": "Flyinium Z Breaker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragon Dance lets Dragonite present itself as a threat, demanding an immediate answer from the opponent to avoid letting it get to +2 Speed and roll through any possible revenge killing options. Fly paired with Flyinium Z lets Dragonite nuke any opposition that's hit neutrally, dropping Pokemon like Tapu Fini, Clefable, and Garchomp after a Dragon Dance. Once Flyinium Z is burned, Fly can still be used as a decently strong STAB attack to threaten Grass-types and force awkward plays, though it does become much easier to play around. Earthquake provides great coverage when paired with Fly, taking on a good number of the Rock-, Electric-, and Steel-types that could try to absorb a Supersonic Skystrike like Tyranitar, Heatran, Magearna, and Jirachi. It also allows Dragonite to hit Toxapex hard without using Supersonic Skystrike, preventing a chipped one from using Scald or Haze without burning Dragonite's Z-Move. Extreme Speed is useful to revenge kill weakened threats and enable Dragonite to sweep should opposing revenge killers like Weavile and Mega Alakazam be sufficiently weakened. Roost is an option to let Dragonite play around Choice Scarf Landorus-T once it has boosted its Speed using Dragon Dance, letting it absorb and burn the PP of Stone Edge or restore Multiscale to ease additional setup to negate Intimidate. It also lets Dragonite boost multiple times against Tapu Koko and threaten Pokemon like Tapu Bulu early-game even in the presence of Stealth Rock, restoring Multiscale and the ability to set up and break or sweep mid- or late-game.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed Tapu Koko, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Lopunny at +1, Choice Scarf Kartana at +2, and Heatran and neutral-natured Mega Garchomp when unboosted. Multiscale lets Dragonite easily set up on neutral attacks and weaker super effective attacks, and it allows Dragonite to even take strong super effective hits like Mega Latias's Ice Beam and Choice Specs Tapu Lele's Moonblast if need be.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As soon as Team Preview, identify what will let you win the game. Will Dragonite's partners be able to win the game if it's able to punch a hole in an opposing defensive core, or is a +1 or +2 Dragonite devastating enough to do so with a little support? What Pokemon on the opposing team can Dragonite set up on? Keep that target or those targets alive, and don't be afraid to make sacrificial plays or double switches if need be late-game to get Dragonite in against a foe it can exploit to boost and win. If at all possible, scout for status moves before trying to set up against Pokemon like Ferrothorn—paralysis cripples Dragonite and makes it much easier to play around and revenge kill, even with Extreme Speed. Dragonite only gets one shot with Supersonic Skystrike, and since Fly can be played around by strong Flying-resistant Pokemon, Dragonite has to be really careful with using its Z-Move. When against a target that Dragonite needs Supersonic Skystrike to break through, analyze whether you could grab an additional Dragon Dance boost or fire off an Earthquake instead without much risk to punish a switch or double switch from the opponent if they're trying to bait out Supersonic Skystrike early or sacrifice one of their less important Pokemon. Set entry hazards early to get the chip damage Dragonite needs to function and prevent opposing entry hazards either through aggressive removal or Taunt combined with constant offensive pressure. Once Dragonite has weakened a defensive core, do not let up the pressure and allow a defensive Pokemon to heal, undoing the work that Dragonite did.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Dragonite naturally pairs with dedicated leads that can both set entry hazards to accumulate chip damage and prevent Stealth Rock from the foe. Excadrill is one option to provide both Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, while Greninja can set Spikes and prevent Stealth Rock with Taunt. Since Dragonite pairs so well with dedicated leads, it becomes a natural fit for hyper offense. Other hyper offense staples thus make good partners. Mega Gyarados and Magearna are two such Pokemon, but because Dragonite requires a Z-Crystal to be effective, it can result in a less effective Magearna set being run. Offensive hazard removal is really nice for maintaining Multiscale. This can come from a number of offensive Pokemon, such as Rapid Spin Excadrill, Defog Kartana, or Defog Landorus-T, but you'll notice that a majority of these Pokemon stack weaknesses or are generally considered subpar options for hazard removal, which definitely contributes to holding Dragonite back in the tier. Another option is to essentially go all-in with offensive type spam. Since most Pokemon that resist Flying lack reliable recovery, one Flying-type Pokemon can break for the other to sweep. Mega Pinsir is an option here, as is Hawlucha, since Dragonite can take down annoyances to it like Clefable or take out chunks of health from Landorus-T or Zapdos.</p> "

It can also be used in Will-O-Wisp's or even Defog and Stealth Rock's moveslot if Mew's team really needs a way to deal sufficient damage to Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor, especially if Mew's team already has a Stealth Rock setter and Defogger. Psychic can also be used if Mew's team doesn't need it to check the aforementioned Pokemon and would instead like it to be able to efficiently check Hawlucha. Will-O-Wisp allows Mew to cripple physical attackers such as Mega Mawile, Mega Medicham, and Kyurem-B and is useful to chip down Magearna, as it lacks reliable recovery. Soft-Boiled allows Mew to stay healthy and lets it switch into physical attackers such as Landorus-T, Mega Medicham, and Mega Lopunny multiple times throughout the match.

If opting to run Ice Beam over Earthquake, a Timid nature should be used.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Mew to switch into physical attackers such as Mega Medicham, Garchomp, and Mega Lopunny, and try to cripple them with Will-O-Wisp. Consistently use Soft-Boiled to keep Mew healthy, as it will fail to switch into the Pokemon it is supposed to check if it's not near full health. For similar reasons, you should try to avoid getting Mew afflicted with burn or poison, as this will cripple its longevity and ability to check Mega Medicham, Garchomp, and Mega Lopunny. Look for opportunities to remove or set entry hazards on passive Pokemon that Mew can force out, such as Zapdos and Hippowdon. Try to be wary of Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar, as they can easily trap Mew and sufficiently weaken it, which makes it significantly harder to get Mew back on the field.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mew tends to give free switches to Dark- and Ghost-types such as Ash-Greninja, Blacephalon, and Gengar, so having switch-ins to these Pokemon, such as Tapu Bulu, Tyranitar, and Toxapex, is mandatory.

Earth Power can be used to hit Tyranitar and Steel-types for super effective damage, but it should be noted that once again most Steel-types only take neutral damage from it due to their secondary typing and it's too weak to OHKO Tyranitar even after a Nasty Plot. Rock Polish effectively lets Mew sweep late-game; however, this option is generally preferred with a Modest nature and is best used on hyper offensive archetypes. Soft-Boiled can be used instead to secure more setup opportunities, but this option is generally preferred with a Timid nature and generally fits better on other archetypes.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Modest nature is preferred with Rock Polish, as Mew will not need the Speed from a Timid nature if it's already set up a boost. A Timid nature is generally better with Soft-Boiled, as it is important to be able to outspeed Pokemon such as Kyurem-B, Tapu Lele, and Jolly Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>When facing offensive teams, Mew will often want to use Rock Polish to outspeed faster Pokemon, and when facing defensively oriented teams, it will want to set up a Nasty Plot to break through walls. Try to weaken the opposing team with other Pokemon such as Magearna and Mega Charizard X first before attempting to sweep with Mew; however, Mew can also be used to weaken the opposing team for the aforementioned Pokemon to sweep. Use Genesis Supernova after a Nasty Plot to heavily damage or KO Pokemon such as Heatran. Use Soft-Boiled against Pokemon like Kyurem-B and Landorus-T to stay healthy and have multiple shots at sweeping.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mew fits the best on typical dual screens hyper offense teams if it is running Rock Polish, where it appreciates the presence of leads such as Landorus-T and Greninja that can guarantee entry hazards being set up so Mew can nab KOs. Other sweepers that can pave the way for Mew to sweep such as Magearna and Mega Charizard X are also appreciated, as they can heavily dent the opposing team. Mega Gyarados is also notable for its ability to deal with Mega Latias, a Pokemon that uses Mew as setup bait. Mew can also fit on bulky offensive builds if it is running Soft-Boiled. Here, too, it appreciates hazards on the opposing field, specifically Spikes and Stealth Rock, as they can wear down whatever is going to switch into Mew; Ferrothorn, Greninja, Clefable, and Heatran can reliably set them up. Tyranitar can trap and remove Mega Latias, which may use Mew as setup bait. It also discourages Choice-locked Dark-types such as Ash-Greninja from using their Dark-type STAB move.</p> "

  "Azumarill": {
    "overview": "<p>Azumarill is a niche option on hyper offense and rain teams due to the combined potency of Belly Drum and Huge Power, granting it a monstrous Attack stat after it boosts up. At +6, Azumarill obliterates Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, and Toxapex with its coverage moves, which can be essential on rain teams due to these three walls specifically being annoying to break. Azumarill's typing also makes it a usable offensive check against Ash-Greninja, which is also appreciated by offensive teams that often contain a lack of reliable defensive answers to top wallbreakers. However, Azumarill's major lack of Speed forces it to rely on priority Aqua Jet. This leaves it shut down by Tapu Lele’s Psychic Terrain and by various faster Pokemon such as Kartana and Rotom-W that can take a hit and retaliate. Additionally, Azumarill usually only gets one opportunity to set up Belly Drum, which forces it to be preserved for late-game to sweep once its checks have been chipped downed enough or removed. However, Z-Belly Drum can offer Azumarill a second opportunity of setting up in some rare instances.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Sitrus Berry can be used over Normalium Z if there is already another Pokemon wielding a Z-Move. However, this item is a massive downgrade from Normalium Z and prevents Azumarill from checking Ash-Greninja and Heatran, as it cannot freely check the opposing team as much without the Z-Move to heal itself up afterwards. A trapping set consisting of Whirlpool, Perish Song, Protect, and Toxic with Sap Sipper as the ability allows Azumarill to defensively check Kartana while also trapping and removing Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Toxapex, but this set mainly relies on surprise factor to catch the opponent off guard and is terribly easy to play around once the opponent knows what the set is. A Choice Band grants Azumarill immediate power, but Azumarill would be widely outclassed by other offensive Water-types such as Ash-Greninja and Mega Swampert. Its STAB moves are also pretty ineffective once it's locked into a move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Tapu Lele: Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain prevents Azumarill from outprioritizing anything that outspeeds it with Aqua Jet. This leaves it massively vulnerable under the effects of the terrain, and Tapu Lele can revenge kill it smoothly.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Azumarill's pitiful Speed leaves it outsped by the majority of the metagame. Magearna, Rotom-W, and Kyurem-B all outpace Azumarill and can finish it off with their coverage. The latter two also resist Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types like Kartana, Tapu Bulu, Serperior, and Mega Venusaur all outspeed Azumarill and knock it out with their main attacks.</p> ",

        "name": "Belly Drum",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Aqua Jet gives Azumarill priority and allows it to bypass Pokemon that would otherwise be able to revenge kill it before boosts, such as Tapu Koko, Tornadus-T, and Mega Medicham. Play Rough is Azumarill's main attack to remove Tapu Fini, Clefable, Mega Heracross, Mega Sableye, and physically defensive Tangrowth with little effort. Knock Off breaks straight through and OHKOes Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Tangrowth smoothly.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Normalium Z gives Azumarill access to Z-Belly Drum, which restores its health back up to full before it cuts its health in half and gives it easier setup opportunities. This is the preferred item, as it allows Azumarill to use its decent defensive typing to check Ash-Greninja and Heatran.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Realistically, Belly Drum can only be set up once in a match, so Azumarill should only set up late-game once its checks have been chipped or removed. Azumarill should not accumulate too much chip damage, as it lessens its opportunities to set up Belly Drum because its low Speed stat usually makes Azumarill take damage before it can set up. Azumarill should be brought in through a pivot or revenge kill before sweeping to prevent it from taking any major damage. Azumarill can also revenge kill Landorus-T, Volcarona, and Excadrill itself, and it can check Ash-Greninja before sweeping due to Z-Belly Drum restoring its health.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pelipper provides rain, which allows a +6 Aqua Jet to hit even harder. Ash-Greninja can use Azumarill to remove its biggest annoyances in Toxapex and Tangrowth to let it freely rain terror on the opponent's team. Mega Swampert also has issues with Grass-type walls like Ferrothorn and physically defensive Tangrowth, and Azumarill can break through these Pokemon for it. Entry hazard setters such as Excadrill, Landorus-T, and Greninja set down Stealth Rock or Spikes for Azumarill to score chip damage on Azumarill's checks. Excadrill can also break through Rotom-W with Earthquake thanks to Mold Breaker. Magearna and Tornadus-T are able to bring Azumarill onto the field while protecting it from any possible damage from the opponent. Tapu Koko provides dual screens for Azumarill to let it set up Belly Drum a lot safer and can pivot Azumarill in safely.</p> "

  "Quagsire": {
    "overview": "<p>With its decent physical bulk when invested, an amazing ability in Unaware, and access to reliable recovery, Quagsire can help stop some of the most dangerous setup sweepers in the tier that could otherwise threaten stall. Its physical bulk also allows it to naturally handle even more threats such as Tyranitar, Mega Charizard X, Landorus-T. Furthermore, it has a useful defensive typing that can help it take on threats, namely most Electric-types lacking Grass-type coverage such as Mega Manectric and non-Grass Knot Tapu Koko. However, Quagsire has very poor special bulk and is therefore left completely vulnerable to almost every somewhat threatening special attacker in the tier such as Tapu Lele, both Greninja formes, and Keldeo. Also, its general passivity and predictability force it to rely on equally passive teammates that can support and benefit from it. While it boasts good physical bulk, relatively powerful physical attackers can simply break through Quagsire. Mega Mawile, Mega Medicham, and Hoopa-U all possess the immediate power to 2HKO Quagsire though its defenses.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Using Waterfall alongside Curse sounds like a good idea at first, but lacking any means of statusing Pokemon that can easily come in on Quagsire makes them more difficult to beat.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types and Grass-type Moves</strong>: Because Quagsire has a 4x weakness to Grass-type moves, it is easily OHKOed by basically any Pokemon with the appropriate move. Tangrowth and Amoonguss both completely wall and threaten to OHKO Quagsire and, even if statused, are hard to wear down due to their Regenerator abilities. The opponent often loses nothing by simply threatening Quagsire and double switching out, putting your team behind in momentum. Mega Venusaur, Serperior, and Tapu Bulu all greatly threaten Quagsire, though it can wear all of them down with burns or poison should they choose to switch in. Serperior and Tapu Bulu in particular pose as potentially dangerous stallbreakers if left unchecked and free to set up. Lures such as Bloom Doom Heatran and Grass Knot Tapu Koko can also catch Quagsire off guard and OHKO it; scouting for such moves is key to not letting Quagsire be unnecessarily KOed.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Almost every special attacker in the tier threatens to 2HKO Quagsire due to its poor special bulk. Most non-Electric-types such as Greninja, Tapu Lele, Mega Charizard Y, Gengar, Keldeo, and Hoopa-U are able to do huge amounts of damage to Quagsire despite not necessarily having super effective coverage moves to hit it with. Quagsire is also unable to status or damage these threats in a one-on-one situation due to its very low Speed tier and is nearly always forced out by them.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Physical Wallbreakers: Very strong physical attackers such as Mega Medicham, Mega Pinsir, Mega Mawile, and Hoopa-U can easily 2HKO Quagsire despite its physical bulk and is thus not able to check these threats.</p> ",

        "name": "Unaware Wall",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>While weak, Scald has a useful 30% burn chance, which helps to wear down checks and further wall physical attackers. Earthquake is used for a decently powerful and consistent STAB move. Toxic lets Quagsire outlast both Pokemon it is supposed to be checking and Pokemon that check it. Toxic is particularly important for beating Roost Mega Charizard X and is helpful for beating and wearing down Landorus-T. Other Pokemon that threaten Quagsire such as Tangrowth can be poisoned upon switching in, which helps beat them in the long term. Recover is crucial and is what allows Quagsire to stay healthy and consistently wall and check what it needs to. Curse can be used over Toxic, as it helps Quagsire take on a select few physical attackers that it could potentially struggle with such as Alolan Marowak and Earth Plate Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A straightforward EV spread of maximum HP and Defense investment with a Relaxed nature allows Quagsire to properly wall the physical attackers it needs to while retaining what power Scald has, as Quagsire's Speed is negligible anyways. Unaware is the only viable ability on Quagsire, as it is what allows Quagsire to wall most physical setup sweepers. Leftovers further helps with longevity and allows Quagsire to avoid important 2HKOs from Pokemon such as Adamant Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Keeping Quagsire healthy with Recover or Wish passing is the most important aspect of using Quagsire. Allowing it to get weakened, get statused, have its item removed, or switch into more than one layer of entry hazards will severely hinder its ability to check threats such as Adamant Landorus-T. Generally, bring Quagsire in on something it walls and use Scald or Toxic to cripple or weaken the foe or potential switch-ins. Be cautious of double switches, as Quagsire alone cannot retaliate against powerful wallbreakers if caught off guard. Quagsire's passivity and predictability make it relatively easy to play around, so pay attention to how your opponent reacts to Quagsire and the rest of the team early-game. Be cautious of Z-Moves, which can either take Quagsire out or weaken it enough for other sweepers on the opponent's team. Proactively using Recover on common Z-Move users potentially wastes the opponent's Z-Move early. Use Curse to more reliably beat Pokemon such as offensive Z-Move Landorus-T and check Magic Guard Clefable and Swords Dance Alolan Marowak, which are very large nuisances to the passive teams on which Quagsire is found. Simply use Curse when Quagsire is healthy enough to take a subsequent attack after it has boosted, then recover off any damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Chansey is a very good teammate for Quagsire, as it walls every special attacker in the tier bar some Tapu Lele variants, Choice Specs Hoopa-U, and other special setup sweepers with access to Psyshock. Additionally, with access to Natural Cure and Heal Bell, Chansey can act as a status absorber for Quagsire. Skarmory keeps entry hazards off the field for Quagsire, can take Grass-type attacks directed at Quagsire, and further walls physical attackers in general. It notably takes on Mega Pinsir and Tapu Bulu, which Quagsire alone cannot handle. Mega Sableye bounces back hazards and generally annoys the opposing team by crippling it with Will-O-Wisp and removing items. Tangrowth holding an Assault Vest can stomach many attacks in general and checks potential stallbreakers such as Serperior and certain Tapu Bulu sets. Tangrowth also serves as a countermeasure to situational lures such as Grass Knot Tapu Koko and shrugs off damage it takes with Regenerator.</p> "

  "Scizor": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Scizor possesses an outstanding defensive typing in Bug / Steel, great defensive stats, and Roost to keep itself healthy, which let it handle titans like Landorus-T, Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and Mamoswine. Mega Scizor holds excellent utility thanks to its access to moves like Bullet Punch and Knock Off. Access to a STAB priority move in Bullet Punch, which is also boosted by Technician, lets Mega Scizor threaten a variety of Pokemon like Tapu Bulu, Kyurem-B, and Mega Diancie. Mega Scizor also has access to Swords Dance, which can let it sweep or clean up late-game. Although Mega Scizor may be capable of beating Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and Mamoswine on their own, they're often paired with Magnezone, which can trap and remove Mega Scizor from the match if not played around cautiously. While Mega Scizor's typing is very strong defensively, it also comes with a downside: it is very susceptible to the decently common Fire-types, and Pokemon that Mega Scizor is supposed to check, such as Kyurem-B and Mega Diancie, often run Fire-type coverage to beat it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Curse boosts Mega Scizor's Defense alongside its Attack, which can be useful against certain Pokemon like Tapu Bulu and Gliscor. A utility set consisting of Bullet Punch, Roost, U-turn, and Defog, Pursuit, or Hidden Power Ice in the last slot can be used if Mega Scizor is needed on a team and not for its sweeping capabilities. It should, however, be noted that it's a poor Defogger, as it doesn't match up well against a majority of entry hazard setters and other Defoggers. Pursuit can let Mega Scizor trap Mega Alakazam and Mega Latios, as well as Choice-locked Tapu Lele and Hoopa-U, but there's very little reason to use Pursuit outside of that. Hidden Power Ice can be used to hit Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor for 4x super effective damage because this Mega Scizor set is very weak. Alternatively, Hidden Power Fire can be used against Kartana and opposing Mega Scizor. You can try to outspeed opposing Mega Scizor with this set to potentially 2HKO it before it can recover back its health with Roost. Toxic may be used on Mega Scizor's utility set to cripple common switch-ins like Zapdos and Landorus-T, but Mega Scizor usually lacks the moveslot to fit it in.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Toxapex is by far the best switch-in to Mega Scizor due to its typing, bulk, and access to Haze. Rotom-W and Keldeo can switch into Mega Scizor, as they fear very little from it and can burn it; they are prone to getting worn down, however. Other Water-types such as Greninja, Mega Swampert, and Gyarados can put Mega Scizor in unfavorable positions. Gyarados can easily take any of Mega Scizor's attacks and use it as bait to set up with Dragon Dance, though Mega Gyarados has to be wary of Curse and U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Magnezone: Magnezone can easily trap and eliminate non-U-turn Mega Scizor thanks to Magnet Pull. Thanks to Magnezone's typing, Bullet Punch also won't do much damage to it. Non-Choice Scarf variants should, however, be wary of faster Mega Scizor with Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types and Coverage</strong>: Using Heatran is one of the best ways to beat Mega Scizor, courtesy of its typing and bulk, but it should watch out for Superpower. Volcarona and both Mega Charizard are also good switch-ins, as they can OHKO Mega Scizor with their respective STAB moves. Mega Charizard X and Volcarona can also use Mega Scizor as setup bait. Magearna, Mega Latias, Kyurem-B, and Mega Diancie—Pokemon that Mega Scizor is supposed to check—often run Fire-type coverage moves to defeat it. Tapu Lele deserves a special mention, as it not only occasionally runs Fire-type coverage but also cancels out Bullet Punch by setting up Psychic Terrain.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types: Celesteela and Skarmory fear very little from Mega Scizor, except for Knock Off. Celesteela can easily beat Mega Scizor with Flamethrower, while Skarmory takes very little damage from anything Mega Scizor might want to attack it with and can phaze it with Whirlwind.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Zapdos and Thundurus resist Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch and can retaliate with Heat Wave or a boosted All-Out Pummeling. Thundurus is prone to being worn down and Zapdos doesn't want to get hit by Knock Off, which makes it undesirable to consistently switch them into Mega Scizor, however.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Special attackers such as Tapu Koko and Tornadus-T can pressure Mega Scizor due to its rather lacking Special Defense stat. Tapu Koko can deal heavy damage to Mega Scizor with STAB Thunderbolt and can even OHKO it with a special Gigavolt Havoc. Tornadus-T can deal heavy amounts of damage with Supersonic Skystrike to Mega Scizor, and even Hurricane 2HKOes it after Stealth Rock damage. It should, however, be noted that they are prone to getting overwhelmed by Swords Dance Mega Scizor due to their lack of bulk and resistance.</p> ",

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Bullet Punch is Mega Scizor's main STAB move and lets it hit Pokemon like Tapu Bulu, Kyurem-B, and Mega Diancie for super effective damage. It's also boosted by Technician and is a priority move, which makes up for Mega Scizor's lack of Speed. Roost lets Mega Scizor stay healthy throughout the match, allowing it to switch in multiple times. Knock Off lets Mega Scizor remove items from, and potentially break past, defensive stops to it such as Celesteela, Toxapex, and Zapdos. Superpower, on the other hand, throttles would-be-checks such as Magnezone and Heatran. Lastly, U-turn may be used to generate momentum for Mega Scizor's team but doesn't hit many notable foes.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP, 16 Defense EVs, and an Impish nature allows Mega Scizor to avoid getting 2HKOed by Sacred Sword from Choice Band Kartana after Stealth Rock damage. The rest of the EVs are put into Special Defense to more comfortable take on Magearna, Mega Alakazam, and Tapu Lele. Do note that Superpower variants should run 136 Speed EVs to outrun Modest Magnezone, though the lack of Special Defense investment will make it harder for Mega Scizor to check the aforementioned Pokemon. Scizor should immediately Mega Evolve, so forgoing Technician is completely fine because Light Metal has its situational use against Trace users like Mega Alakazam and the rare Low Kick Weavile and Greninja.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Scizor should aim to weaken the opposing team before sweeping by forcing switches and using Knock Off or U-turn. It should be used to pivot into threats like Landorus-T, Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and Mamoswine. Don't use Swords Dance purely to sweep, as Mega Scizor can also be used to defeat Pokemon like Magearna and Ferrothorn. Mega Scizor can lay pressure on the opponent's team by using Swords Dance to force a switch so that it can freely use Knock Off or U-turn to weaken the team. Always scout for Fire-type coverage on Pokemon that Mega Scizor is supposed to check, such as Kyurem-B and Mega Diancie. If the opponent has Magnezone, Mega Scizor should be wary of using Swords Dance and should instead always use U-turn or double switch out. You should also be cautious when knocking out Pokemon, as this can give Magnezone a free switch in and will result in a knocked out Mega Scizor. Superpower variants should, instead, scout the Magnezone set and be careful around Choice Scarf variants of Magnezone. The team's matchup against Kartana can usually help telling the Magnezone set, though, because teams that are weak to Kartana are inclined to run Choice Scarf Magnezone.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Garchomp can pressure Fire-, Steel-, and Electric-types like Heatran, Celesteela, and Zapdos, all of which Mega Scizor tends to struggle against. Mega Scizor can heavily pressure Fairy-, Ice-, and Grass-types for Garchomp in return. It's also capable of getting Garchomp a free switch in with U-turn. Toxapex and Gastrodon can take on Fire-, Water-, and Steel-types for Mega Scizor. Gastrodon also takes on a majority of Electric-types very well. In return, Mega Scizor lays pressure on Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu and Kartana, which can try to take advantage of Toxapex and Gastrodon. Heatran is an excellent teammate because it has an immunity to Fire and appreciates Mega Scizor's ability to take on Ground-types like Gliscor and Mamoswine. Defoggers such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos are great because Mega Scizor may experience trouble checking Landorus-T, Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and Mamoswine if entry hazards are on the field. In contrast, Mega Scizor appreciates entry hazards on the opposing side of the field to consistently wear down switch-ins such as Toxapex and Heatran, allowing it to sweep more easily. Entry hazard setters such as Clefable, Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Greninja are notable partners.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Mega Heracross is one of the most powerful wallbreakers in the tier, being able to dismantle defensive teams with Swords Dance along with its high Attack stat. Having a unique defensive typing along with respectable bulk allows Mega Heracross to check many top-tier offensive threats such as Swords Dance Tapu Bulu and Gliscor as well as act as a solid Dark-type check. On the other hand, Mega Heracross's typing also leaves it weak to common types in Fairy, Flying, and Fire, and both of its STAB moves share common resistances, oftentimes being redundant in terms of coverage. In addition to its common weaknesses, Mega Heracross's poor Speed tier makes it easy to revenge kill for Pokemon like Tapu Lele, Mega Alakazam, and Mega Pinsir. Due to its tendency to fall against faster offensive threats, Mega Heracross tends to struggle against highly offensive teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mega Heracross can also utilize an all-out attacking set with Earthquake over Swords Dance to threaten bulkier teams without having to set up, but it fails to break through many of its normal checks, mainly Clefable, and it's very reliant on prediction to be successful.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Flying-types: Flying-type Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Mega Pinsir resist Mega Heracross's STAB moves and threaten to OHKO it with super effective STAB attacks, but they have to be wary of switching into a potential Rock Blast. Supersonic Skystrike Landorus-T is especially troublesome due to its neutrality to Rock Blast.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-type Attacks: Offensive Psychic-types such as Mega Latios, Tapu Lele, and Mega Alakazam all switch into Mega Heracross's Close Combat with varying degrees of ease and threaten it out with super effective STAB attacks, but they all have to be careful switching into Mega Heracross, as they must avoid Pin Missile. Additionally, Pokemon that carry Psychic-type attacks, such as Psychium Z Greninja, can catch Mega Heracross off guard and OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-type Pokemon such as Heatran and Volcarona threaten to OHKO Mega Heracross with their STAB attacks as well, but they oftentimes cannot pivot directly into Mega Heracross due to being OHKOed by Close Combat and Rock Blast respectively.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Offensive Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele can threaten to OHKO Mega Heracross. However, Unaware Clefable is arguably the best Mega Heracross counter in the tier, being able to switch into it and avoid being 2HKOed by any attack, though it has to be wary of being whittled down by entry hazards and the rare Grassy Terrain-boosted Bullet Seed. Magic Guard Clefable is similarly annoying, being difficult to whittle down and taking any attack from full at +2 besides Bullet Seed in Grassy Terrain.</p> ",

The last slot is a toss-up based on a combination of team structure and personal preference. The most common option is Pin Missile for its ability to pressure bulky Psychic-types such as Reuniclus and Mega Latias. Alternatively, Substitute can be used to allow Mega Heracross to more freely set up against Pokemon like Toxapex and Amoonguss as well as easing prediction against more offensive teams. Mega Heracross can also opt to go for Bullet Seed when paired with Tapu Bulu to have a pseudo-STAB move that can 2HKO many would-be checks, such as Clefable and defensive Flyinium Z Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>An Adamant nature is preferred, because regular Heracross still outspeeds Modest Heatran with it, and the added power is extremely important against the likes of Toxapex and Unaware Clefable. Moxie allows Mega Heracross to gain boosts upon KOing Pokemon such as Heatran and Tyranitar prior to Mega Evolution so that it can garner some boosts early on without having to set up. On the other hand, Guts can be used over Moxie to allow Heracross to fare better against bulkier teams that rely on status conditions, such as burn, to cripple wallbreakers.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Pivot Mega Heracross into Pokemon that don't pose a threat to it, such as Gliscor, Tapu Bulu, and Chansey, early-game so that it can break the opposing team. If running Jolly Heracross, consider not Mega Evolving it prior to KOing Pokemon base-forme Heracross outspeeds that Mega Heracross cannot such as Heatran and Mamoswine. Attempt to chip checks such as Clefable and Toxapex into range of Rock Blast by pressuring them with Pokemon that share them as mutual checks such as Garchomp and Greninja respectively. Avoid using Swords Dance against slower Pokemon that threaten to KO Mega Heracross, such as Z-Move Reuniclus and Magearna, early on, seeing as Mega Heracross's absurd Attack stat means that it will likely put a dent into whatever switches into it anyway.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Seeing that Mega Heracross is a wallbreaker, it appreciates pivots such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Assault Vest Magearna that can bring it in and allow it to break down the opposing team without taking unnecessary damage. Additionally, entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Greninja and Ferrothorn is very useful due to the sheer number of switches that Mega Heracross forces, resulting in damage building up on opposing teams if entry hazards are up. Clefable in particular is a useful teammate because it can provide Wish support to Mega Heracross, allowing it to consistently check Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu and Gliscor while also functioning as a durable wallbreaker that can rip through an opposing team on top of being able to wear down the opposing team with Stealth Rock. Late-game cleaners such as Shift Gear Magearna appreciate Mega Heracross's ability to punch holes in teams and make it much easier to set up and sweep late-game. If Mega Heracross is using Bullet Seed, Tapu Bulu is an important teammate due to Grassy Terrain giving Bullet Seed a sizable boost, allowing it to 2HKO Clefable and hit a slew of other targets. Should Mega Heracross choose to forego Pin Missile in favor of other coverage or Substitute, Pursuit trapping from the likes of Weavile or Tyranitar is appreciated, as they can KO threats such as Mega Latios that would otherwise wall it. Mega Heracross's inability to check Heatran from the Mega Slot position oftentimes leaves its teams liable to Heatran, so teammates such as Gliscor that can check Heatran are invaluable assets when constructing a Mega Heracross team. Finally, Pokemon that resist Flying such as Tapu Koko and Heatran function well alongside Mega Heracross to cover up for its defensive weaknesses. Tapu Koko in particular is an effective teammate because it also functions as a pivot that allows Mega Heracross to break opposing teams.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Mantine is a great special wall in OU and is capable of walling a significant portion of the metagame. Because of its typing, it's able to be one of the best answers to Volcarona in the tier while also being able to switch into threats such as Ash-Greninja and Mega Charizard Y. Mantine is also a good Defogger, being able to deter Pokemon such as Bisharp and Landorus-T from switching in to take advantage of it with a Scald burn. However, Mantine is very passive and can drain momentum from your team, and its weakness to Stealth Rock is suboptimal for a defensive Pokemon. The prevalence of Electric-types such as Mega Manectric and Tapu Koko also hinders Mantine, as it can't do much against them. Finally, it has relatively low Defense, even when invested, so Pokemon such as Mega Medicham and Landorus-T can easily do massive damage to it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mantine has no other viable options in the OU tier, as it cannot properly perform its role without the moves or defensive investment on the listed set.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-type Coverage</strong>: Tapu Koko, Magnezone, and Mega Manectric can all easily take a Scald and threaten Mantine out with a STAB Thunderbolt. Magearna and Rotom-W can also do massive damage to Mantine with Volt Switch. Mega Medicham and Mega Mawile can both OHKO Mantine with Thunder Punch; however, they must be wary of Scald burns.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage: Stealth Rock chips a quarter of Mantine's health away each time it switches in, making it more difficult for Mantine to switch into attacks. Similarly, Toxic from Pokemon such as Heatran can wear Mantine down quickly, making it less effective as a wall.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt users such as Heatran and Tornadus prevent Mantine from healing, removing entry hazards, or spreading poison.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Coverage: Although none of them want to take a Scald, Tyranitar, Mega Diancie, and Landorus-T can all OHKO Mantine with their respective Rock-type move.</p> <p><strong>Strong Attacks: Wallbreakers such as Choice Specs Tapu Lele and Mega Charizard X can easily 2HKO Mantine with their strong STAB attacks.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Roost is mandatory, as it allows Mantine to repeatedly come in on Pokemon it is supposed to counter such as Greninja and Volcarona. Scald gives Mantine a little offensive presence and prevents it from being Taunt bait while also having a 30% chance to burn. Defog is a great option on Mantine as it clears hazards for Mantine's teammates while also removing Stealth Rock to help Mantine switch in. Toxic allows Mantine to cripple Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Latios, and Tangrowth on the switch and deal damage to Pokemon such as Keldeo. Finally, Haze gets rid of boosts from setup sweepers such as non-Thunderbolt Magearna, Volcarona, and Manaphy and prevents them from taking advantage of Mantine.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP EVs maximize Mantine's overall bulk. The given Special Defense investment allows Mantine to take two Dark Pulses from Ash-Greninja if Stealth Rock is up, survive two Shadow Balls from Choice Specs Blacephalon, and avoid the 2HKO from Pelipper's Choice Specs Hurricane. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Defense to take on physical threats such as Mega Scizor more efficiently. Leftovers gives Mantine passive recovery, allowing it to sponge hits better. Water Absorb is the best ability, as it gives Mantine an immunity to Water-type attacks, allowing it to pivot into Scalds without fearing a burn.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mantine should be used as a defensive pivot to switch into Pokemon such as Ash-Greninja and Mega Scizor. Prioritize keeping Mantine healthy with Roost, as it tends to get worn down a lot between Stealth Rock damage and taking hits. Be careful of Hidden Power Electric from Pokemon that might carry it such as Greninja and Keldeo. Use Haze on Pokemon that are able to set up on Mantine such as Manaphy and Volcarona. If Defog is being run, try to use it on Pokemon Mantine can force out such as Keldeo. Try not to let Mantine get badly poisoned by Toxic, as it severely limits its ability to take hits.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mantine fits best on bulkier teams that need a switch-in for threats such as Volcarona, Heatran and Mega Latios. Thus, other bulky Pokemon make good teammates. Ferrothorn is a very good defensive partner for Mantine, as it can switch into Electric- and Rock-type moves aimed at Mantine, while Mantine can switch into Fighting- and Fire-type moves for Ferrothorn. Other Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss are also good for switching into Electric-types such as Tapu Koko. Heatran is also a good defensive partner for Mantine, as it appreciates Mantine's ability to switch into Ground-types, while Heatran can force out bulky Grass-types that Mantine can't touch. If Defog isn't being run on Mantine, another entry hazard remover such as Landorus or Tornadus is recommended, as Stealth Rock severely hampers Mantine's longevity.</p> "

  "Skarmory": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to a high Defense stat and great defensive typing, Skarmory is a good check to several physical attackers including Garchomp, Kartana, Tapu Bulu, Landorus-T, and Mega Scizor due to its access to Whirlwind and Toxic. Skarmory also has access to Spikes, which it can set up mutiple times throughout a battle. For these reasons, Skarmory is a decent pick on stall and balance teams. However, Skarmory's low HP and Special Defense stats mean it struggles to take even resisted hits from special attackers like Tapu Lele and Mega Alakazam, leaving it outclassed by Celesteela in this regard. Skarmory is also very passive, relying on Toxic to deal damage unless it is running Counter or Brave Bird. This leaves it completely useless against Taunt users like Tornadus-T and Tapu Fini. Despite its high Defense stat, physical attackers such as Swords Dance Kartana and Garchomp can potentially overwhelm Skarmory with Z-Moves if they have already set up.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Defog can be used if Skarmory's team needs a form of hazard removal. Although Skarmory has a favorable matchup against entry hazard setters like Garchomp and Ferrothorn, it fails to force them out and keep hazards off reliably. Poor matchups against other hazard setters like Heatran and Greninja also make it an unreliable Defogger. Iron Defense can be used alongside 96 Speed EVs in order to outspeed and beat Swords Dance Mega Mawile one-on-one while also easing prediction against the likes of Swords Dance Garchomp. However, it has no other use and is hard to fit onto Skarmory's set. Stealth Rock is an alternative if Skarmory's team is lacking it. However, one of the main reasons for using Skarmory is for its access to Spikes, and there are also better Stealth Rock setters that can fit on stall and balance teams.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Tapu Koko, Rotom-W, and Zapdos all force out Skarmory with their super effective STAB attacks. They can also use Defog to remove Spikes that Skarmory sets. Magnezone is especially problematic, as it can trap Skarmory if it isn't holding a Shed Shell.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Heatran, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard X can all take advantage of Skarmory. The former can set up Stealth Rock or throw out a powerful Magma Storm, while the latter two can use it as setup fodder. However, Volcarona must be wary when setting up against variants with Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Special attackers such as Greninja, Magearna, Kyurem, and Hydreigon have little trouble getting past Skarmory due to its low special bulk. Pokemon like Mega Alakazam and Tapu Lele also overwhelm Skarmory with very strong STAB attacks or neutral coverage moves like Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Tornadus-T and Tapu Fini can shut down Skarmory with Taunt, leaving it unable to set up Spikes, use Roost to stay healthy, or use Whirlwind to phaze them.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Spikes is used to wear down the opposing team, especially in combination with Whirlwind. This is useful on the stall and balance teams that Skarmory is found on. Whirlwind allows Skarmory to phaze setup sweepers like Garchomp, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Scizor. Similarly, this move can prevent Substitute users like Serperior and Kyurem or bulky Calm Mind users like Mega Latias and Reuniclus from using Skarmory as setup fodder. Toxic is used to cripple Pokemon, especially setup sweepers like Tapu Bulu and Garchomp, wearing them down and easing Skarmory's matchup against them. It also punishes Defog users such as Tornadus-T, Rotom-W, and Zapdos that switch in to remove Skarmory's Spikes. Counter can be used to handle physical attackers that Skarmory checks such as Kartana and Mega Tyranitar. However, it's somewhat unreliable, especially against Pokemon with setup moves, so it struggles to fit onto Skarmory's moveset. Brave Bird deals immediate damage to foes without having to rely on Toxic or Counter, although it's hard to justify over Skarmory's other moves. It hits Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth for decent damage, and OHKOes Fighting-types like Mega Medicham and Mega Heracross that are usually troublesome for defensive teams.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Skarmory's HP and Defense stats are maximized, as it has little hope of dealing with special attackers regardless. The investment is needed to take boosted Z-Moves like Continental Crush from Garchomp and All-Out Pummeling from Kartana. Rocky Helmet punishes contact moves from Pokemon such as Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Scizor, as well as U-turn from the likes of Landorus-T and Jirachi. Shed Shell can be used to prevent Magnezone from trapping Skarmory. Sturdy allows Skarmory to take one hit from full HP in order to use Whirlwind or Counter against a foe in a pinch. An Impish nature should be used alongside Brave Bird to avoid weakening it.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Skarmory can be switched into physical attackers that it checks, and its health should be maintained by using Roost often so that it can take attacks like Sacred Sword from Choice Band Kartana and +2 Continental Crush from Garchomp. However, Skarmory must be wary of very powerful attacks, as well as super effective coverage moves. A +2 All-Out Pummeling from Kartana and Fire Punch from Mega Tyranitar will OHKO and 2HKO Skarmory, respectively, unless Skarmory is kept near full health. Skarmory must also be careful when switching into Garchomp before its set is revealed, as it could turn out to be a Mega Garchomp with Fire Blast. Avoid switching Skarmory into special attackers, as even resisted attacks like Psychic from Tapu Lele as well as neutral attacks like Ice Beam from Mega Latias will overwhelm it. Spikes is best used against Pokemon that can't deal much damage to Skarmory such as Mega Scizor and Gliscor, as well as Choice-locked Kartana and Landorus-T. If Skarmory is lacking a Shed Shell, it should be wary of using Spikes or Toxic if the opponent has a Magnezone and should instead double switch or use Whirlwind. If Stealth Rock is off the field and Skarmory is at full HP, it can utilize Sturdy along with Whirlwind or Counter to act as an emergency check to Pokemon such as +2 Mega Mawile or Mega Heracross, which could otherwise OHKO it with Thunder Punch and Close Combat, respectively.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Skarmory fits best on stall and balance teams that appreciate a blanket check to physical attackers and Spikes support. Chansey is one of the best partners that fits on stall; it acts as a blanket check to special attackers that Skarmory can't deal with such as Ash-Greninja and Mega Alakazam. It can also set up Stealth Rock, forming an entry hazard stacking core with Skarmory to wear down the opposing team. Pokemon with Unaware like Clefable and Quagsire help against setup sweepers that Skarmory can't deal with. The former takes on Mega Heracross and Serperior, while the latter can deal with Mega Charizard X and stop Electric-types. Gliscor and Hippowdon are Stealth Rock setters that pair well with Skarmory. The former checks Heatran, while the latter deals with physical attackers such as Mega Mawile and Mega Charizard X that Skarmory fails to check. Both of these also prevent Electric-types from spamming Volt Switch. Pokemon that can deal with Fire-types, such as Mega Latias, Gliscor, and Toxapex, help against Heatran and Volcarona, which switch into Skarmory for free. Bulky Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss can reliably check Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Rotom-W. Gastrodon is an interesting partner that completely stops these Electric-types while also dealing with other special attackers like Heatran and Ash-Greninja.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Kingdra's decent Speed stat in combination with Swift Swim allows it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, as well as most Choice Scarf users, when in the rain. This combined with a decent Special Attack stat makes it a top Swift Swim user in the metagame. Kingdra's access to a powerful secondary STAB move in Draco Meteor is a blessing, giving it the means to pressure or KO Pokemon that annoy rain teams such as Mega Venusaur and Mega Latias. Kingdra's Dragon / Water typing is also useful for checking Ash-Greninja as it is a rain attacker that isn't prone to Water Shuriken. Unfortunately, bulky Water- and Grass-types such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Assault Vest Tangrowth are some of the most common defensive Pokemon in OU, meaning that Kingdra will have trouble sweeping most teams. Kingdra is also heavily dependent on rain in order to be effective, as it is relatively weak and slow for an offensive Pokemon outside of it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Toxic can be used to cripple common switch-ins to Kingdra such as Tangrowth, Mantine, Gastrodon, and Alomomola. Kingdra can opt to run Hidden Power Electric to hit Mantine.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types: Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Assault Vest Tangrowth all resist Kingdra's main STAB move, avoiding the 2HKO from rain-boosted Hydro Pump. However, Ferrothorn lacks reliable recovery, and Amoonguss and Tangrowth must be wary of switching in to Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Toxapex, Mantine, Tapu Fini, and Gastrodon are tough Pokemon for Kingdra to take down. Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Mantine boast good special bulk and reliable recovery, while Tapu Fini resists Water and is immune to Kingdra's Draco Meteor.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey's incredible special bulk in combination with reliable recovery allows it to consistently deal with Kingdra, easily avoiding the 2HKO from even rain-boosted Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Priority users such as Mega Mawile and Mega Pinsir can all pick off Kingdra if it has been weakened a bit. Choice Scarf Tapu Koko and Greninja are so fast that they can outspeed Kingdra even under the rain. Mega Alakazam can trace Kingdra's Swift Swim ability to outspeed it and deal heavy damage with Psychic or Dazzling Gleam.</p> <p><strong>Alternative Weather Setters: Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Mega Charizard Y, and Alolan Ninetales are able to hamper Kingdra by changing the weather condition. Tyranitar will summon sand, boosting its Special Defense and allowing it to tank Hydro Pump. Mega Charizard Y will summon sun, forcing Kingdra out. Lastly, Alolan-Ninetales will summon hail, which will allow it to outspeed Kingdra, threatening to OHKO it with Freeze-Dry.</p> ",

Boosted by rain and boasting high power, Hydro Pump is a powerful move that will 2HKO, if not OHKO, most of the metagame, bar Chansey and specially defensive resists. Surf is slightly weaker, trading that power for 100% accuracy, making it a reliable option when trying to clean late-game. Draco Meteor is a powerful secondary STAB move that can deal heavy damage to common Water-resistant Pokemon such as Toxapex and Mega Venusaur. Ice Beam is used to nail Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth. Hidden Power Grass may also be used to remove Gastrodon, but has little use otherwise.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Swift Swim is what enables Kingdra to be a threatening sweeper, doubling its Speed when in the rain. Maximum Special Attack investment combined with a Modest nature and Choice Specs enables Kingdra to hit as hard as possible, while maximum Speed investment allows Kingdra to outspeed everything up to and including base 110 Choice Scarf users such as Gengar and Latios when factoring in Swift Swim.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>One of the biggest things to keep in mind when using Kingdra is that one cannot afford to play passively. Taking full advantage of the 8 turns of rain provided by Pelipper is one of the first things that one should aim to do. Once the rain is set, aim to bring Kingdra onto the field as quickly as possible and start firing off attacks. Kingdra's decent defensive typing and serviceable bulk can help in instances such as switching into Pokemon such as Heatran or Greninja. It is also worth noting that if the opponent has a full on counter measure, such as Toxapex, Chansey, or Gastrodon, it is a smart idea to double switch out of Kingdra into another Pokemon that can pressure it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pelipper is the obvious first choice and a mandatory partner when you consider that Kingdra requires rain support in order to take advantage of its Swift Swim ability. Pelipper also happens to provide momentum via U-turn, which can be useful to bring Kingdra in safely. Pelipper can even utilize its Choice Specs set to pressure Kingdra's counters such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and even Knock Off Chansey's Eviolite.  Tapu Koko is a good partner for its ability to pressure Toxapex, wearing down defensive Grass-types such as Ferrothorn and Mega Venusaur, and boost Kingdra's Hidden Power Electric. Defensively, Ferrothorn is a great teammate because of how its Fire-type weakness is reduced under rain, and it can support Kingdra with moves such as Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Knock Off. Mega Scizor is an option too because it can provide momentum with U-turn and Defog away Toxic Spikes for Kingdra and its teammates. Lastly, Tapu Lele can be a nice partner with its Psychic Surge ability, preventing Pokemon from revenge killing Kingdra with priority moves. Tapu Lele takes advantage of many Pokemon Kingdra loses to such as Toxapex and Amoonguss and it can utilize items such as Fightinium Z to lure in Ferrothorn.</p> "

With its great ability Pressure, Suicune can threaten offensive and defensive builds alike that have difficulty breaking through it. Despite common threats on defensive builds such as Toxapex not being scared of Suicune, it can still manage to PP stall a majority of defensive threats that would normally do a great job of checking Water-types, such as Ferrothorn, with Substitute and Pressure. However, commonly seen faster offensive threats like Tapu Koko and Timid Tapu Lele with Psyshock pressure Suicune out of setting up and breaking through numerous offensive teams in the metagame, although they must watch out for Scald burns. In addition, Suicune requires extensive support to get it to function well against teams which utilize defensive stops to it such as Toxapex and Tapu Fini.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A RestTalk Calm Mind set can be used to give Suicune more consistent longevity and to make it less reliant on hazard removal for Toxic Spikes. Roar can also be used on the RestTalk set to deter opposing setup sweepers from taking advantage of Suicune and works well in combination with entry hazard support, although this means Suicune has to forgo Sleep Talk and become more passive or Calm Mind and forfeit its use as a setup sweeper.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Toxapex, Tapu Fini, Keldeo, and even Mantine serve as strong answers to Suicune. Toxapex takes very little damage from Scald while Mantine is immune to it, and they can both use Haze to rid Suicune of its Calm Mind boosts. Keldeo breaks past Suicune due to Secret Sword hitting Suicune's weaker Defense, while Tapu Fini can put a stop to Suicune with a combination of Taunt + Nature's Madness.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: While they have difficulty breaking past Suicune if it has accumulated enough Calm Mind boosts, Amoonguss and Tangrowth both have Regenerator to outstall Suicune and prevent it from sweeping the rest of their team. Mega Venusaur is also a strong answer if it can pressure Suicune enough, but must watch out, as it only has 8 Synthesis PP to keep it healthy and Suicune can thus outlast it.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types and Coverage: Tapu Koko and other threats with Electric-type coverage, such as Mega Mawile, can break Suicune's Substitute and prevent it from accumulating Calm Mind boosts, thus forcing it out.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users: Taunt users such as Tapu Fini, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Koko can prevent Suicune from using Substitute, Calm Mind, Rest, and Protect, leaving it only able to Scald, meaning it loses Scald PP more quickly and can no longer do its job.</p> <p><strong>Status and Knock Off: Status conditions such as burn and poison as well as the move Knock Off stop Suicune completely from setting up and sweeping due to cutting off Suicune's recovery, which it needs to PP stall its foes.</p> ",

        "name": "Substitute + Calm Mind",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald is Suicune's main STAB move and can wear down threats due to its burn chance, although this must be used wisely against defensive teams with threats such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss, as they can engage in stalemates with Suicune and stall out all Scald's PP, thus preventing Suicune from sweeping. Thanks to its decent Speed stat, Substitute allows Suicune to avoid status moves such as Will-O-Wisp and Toxic from the likes of Rotom-W and Heatran while aiding it in PP stalling threats such as Ferrothorn, which can only hit Suicune with 4 Power Whips due to Pressure. Calm Mind allows Suicune to perform as a sweeper, as it is capable of taking advantage of special attackers even with super effective coverage such as Amoonguss and Rotom-W, which can fail to break Suicune's Substitute once it has accumulated enough boosts. Protect allows Suicune to scout for coverage and status moves which can harm it, though it is mainly used to PP stall threats trying to break Suicune's Substitute.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP investment allows Suicune to take advantage of its phenomenal natural bulk while also giving it the opportunity to make 101 HP Substitutes, which don't break to one Seismic Toss. The 40 Special Defense EVs notably allow Suicune's Substitute after a Calm Mind to take Amoonguss's Giga Drain while also lowering the chance of Rotom-W breaking it with Volt Switch. 216 Speed EVs allow Suicune to outspeed base 80s. Pressure is Suicune's only available ability and is the main reason for the success of this set; it allows Suicune to take 2 PP off of any offensive move that is used against Suicune, leaving them with very few opportunities to break Suicune in combination with Substitute and Protect. Leftovers is necessary in order for Suicune to take advantage of the turns where it uses Substitute and Protect to stay as healthy as possible throughout the match.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Do not send out Suicune until all of its counters, such as Toxapex, Tapu Fini, and the rare Mantine, are eliminated, as they will prevent Suicune from setting up Calm Mind boosts, thus leaving it only able to PP stall and throw out Scalds. Also do not come in when there are Toxic Spikes on the field from threats like Toxapex, as these reduce Suicune's longevity, meaning it has no chance to sweep properly. Calm Mind should be used when Suicune safely has a Substitute up when it needs to handle special attackers like Amoonguss better. However, be careful with using Suicune's Scald PP against threats that are not easily worn down, such as Amoonguss; while Suicune can PP stall it out, it needs its Scald PP in order to sweep after its checks and counters are weakened.</p> <p>If a fast offensive threat such as Tapu Koko or Serperior comes in on Suicune while it sets up a Substitute, do not try to set up against them; Suicune can Protect to gain Leftovers recovery while draining some PP from these foes and then Scald the next turn for a potential burn chance while they break Suicune's Substitute. After this, Suicune should switch out to avoid getting worn down. If the foe has Knock Off, never send Suicune directly in, as if Suicune loses its Leftovers, it loses the ability to last throughout the match, meaning it will have a hard time sweeping. Against slower defensive threats such as Ferrothorn, Suicune can set up Substitute and use Protect to gain back recovery while also PP stalling them.</p> <p>Avoid letting Suicune get poisoned or burned under all circumstances, as these two statuses prevent Suicune from sweeping by cutting off its much-needed recovery. Be careful when up against status users with no Substitute, as predicting incorrectly can be costly. For example, do not use Scald on a Rotom-W predicting it to Pain Split against Suicune, or it might burn Suicune with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Suicune requires a lot of support in order for it to sweep, the first of which are teammates that allow Suicune to bypass Haze users like Toxapex, which are hard stops to Suicune. Heatran with Magma Storm can take out both Toxapex and Tapu Fini for Suicune by use of Tectonic Rage for Toxapex and Bloom Doom for Tapu Fini while also breaking down passive threats to Suicune such as Chansey, Amoonguss, and Tangrowth. Tapu Koko can take care of these threats as well while also providing pivot support with Volt Switch or U-turn in order to get Suicune in safely. Other strong wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele work to pressure Toxapex and Chansey.</p> <p>Entry hazard support is very useful for Suicune to more easily break past defensive threats, so Stealth Rock support from the likes of Garchomp or Landorus-T assists Suicune in performing its role well; Garchomp and Landorus-T can also use Continental Crush to take out Grass-type threats such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss, which Suicune struggles to break past. Spikes from the likes of Ferrothorn, Greninja, and Ash-Greninja allow Suicune to take out weakened grounded threats, and Greninja can also use Extrasensory to weaken Toxapex or Gunk Shot to take out Tapu Fini for Suicune. Assault Vest Tangrowth and Mega Venusaur pair well with this set, as they aid Suicune by taking on the Water-types that Suicune does not want to deal with such as Tapu Fini, Greninja, and Keldeo, the latter of which can break Suicune's Substitute repeatedly with Secret Sword. Mega Scizor and Celesteela are useful Steel-type partners, as they can deal with Psychic-types such as Latios and Timid Tapu Lele with Psyshock, which can threaten this set; Mega Scizor can also use Defog to remove entry hazards such as Toxic Spikes for Suicune. Finally, Toxic Spikes setters like Greninja provide great support for Suicune, allowing it to weaken Grass-types like Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu faster than with a burn from Scald.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Tyranitar's high Attack stat coupled with powerful, spammable STAB moves in Stone Edge and Crunch makes it a fearsome wallbreaker. Powerful STAB Pursuit lets Tyranitar also serve as one of OU's most threatening trappers. Tyranitar can use its solid bulk and unique typing to check Pokemon such as Mega Latios, Choice-locked Tapu Lele, and Volcarona. Sand Stream is also noteworthy because it allows Tyranitar to support sand sweepers like Excadrill and Mega Garchomp. Finally, Mega Tyranitar can make use of its added titanic bulk and Speed to set up and sweep with Dragon Dance, as well as check dangerous threats such as BoltBeam Magearna, Kyurem-B, and Heatran. Unfortunately, Tyranitar is let down by its Rock / Dark typing, which leaves it vulnerable to many of OU's common types such as Fighting, Ground, and Water. Its STAB attacks are also not as spammable against Mega Mawile, Magearna, and Landorus-T. Another downfall is that Tyranitar's low Speed causes it to be forced out frequently by faster threats.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf can be run on Tyranitar to reliably pressure Mega Latios and Mega Pinsir, though it's still quite slow as a Choice Scarf user.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Keldeo, Mega Lopunny, Mega Heracross, Mega Medicham, and other Fighting-types can outspeed Tyranitar and KO it with their STAB attacks while resisting both of Tyranitar's STAB moves. When using a Choice Scarf, these Pokemon can easily outrun and KO +1 Mega Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage: Focus Blast from the likes of Alakazam, Gengar, and Mega Charizard Y; Superpower from Tornadus-T; and Low Kick from Greninja punish Tyranitar's massive Fighting weakness. In addition, Pokemon that Tyranitar typically checks such as Heatran and Latios can damage it super effectively with Earth Power and Surf, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Defensive Landorus-T tanks even Choice Band-boosted attacks somewhat well while hitting Tyranitar for super effective damage with U-turn or STAB Earthquake. It can also set up Stealth Rock as Tyranitar is scared out. Offensive Landorus-T simply outspeeds Tyranitar and OHKOes it with Earthquake. Hippowdon easily tanks hits from Tyranitar and can set Stealth Rock or threaten Tyranitar with Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Tapu Bulu, Tapu Lele, Magearna, Mega Diancie, Mega Mawile, and other Fairy-types cannot switch in safely against more offensive Tyranitar sets for fear of being hit hard by Stone Edge, but they can outspeed and obliterate Tyranitar with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Some Steel-types resist both of Tyranitar's STAB moves, while others are simply very bulky or resist Stone Edge. Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Jirachi can all effectively check Tyranitar; however, Jirachi must flinch Tyranitar with Iron Head or it will fall to Crunch. In addition, Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch can revenge kill a boosted Mega Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Keldeo, Greninja, Gyarados, and other offensive Water-types can crush Tyranitar with their STAB attacks. Bulkier Water-types, such as Toxapex and Rotom-W, can tank a hit from Tyranitar and either pivot out or threaten it with a burn.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stone Edge is important in order to pressure Defoggers such as Tornadus-T and Tapu Fini. Mega Tyranitar is a good Pursuit user, as it is capable of forcing out many prevalent Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Heatran, and Mega Latias. Fire Punch is the preferred option in the final moveslot to hit Steel-types that are 4x weak to Fire such as Ferrothorn, Kartana, and Mega Scizor while still hitting Magearna and Mega Mawile hard. Earthquake can be run instead if doing more damage to Heatran, Magearna, and Mega Mawile is desired, but it does make it significantly harder for Mega Tyranitar to deal with the aforementioned foes. Another option that can be run over Fire Punch or Earthquake is Crunch, which makes it much easier for Mega Tyranitar to pressure bulky Psychic-types such as Reuniclus and Mega Latias but leaves it walled by Magearna and Mega Mawile. Ice Punch is also an option to punish Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp. Lastly, Superpower can be run to hit Heatran, Kartana, and Ferrothorn super effectively while still hitting Mega Mawile and Magearna for decent damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>124 Speed EVs let Mega Tyranitar outspeed uninvested Rotom-W, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Venusaur. 252 Attack EVs allow Mega Tyranitar to do as much damage as possible to Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Mega Latias with Pursuit while also giving it the best chance to 2HKO Leftovers Magearna with Fire Punch. The rest of the EVs are invested into HP to minimize the chance of being 2HKOed by Earthquake from Mega Latios after Stealth Rock damage before Tyranitar has Mega Evolved.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>With Mega Tyranitar, you should switch it into play proactively, especially early-game in order to set Stealth Rock and Mega Evolve. From there, you should primarily focus on pressuring common Defoggers such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos. It should also be switched in aggressively against Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Heatran, and Mega Latias in order to Pursuit trap them, which can land very key chip damage for teammates such as Kartana, Gliscor, and Tapu Lele. However, due to its lack of recovery options, Mega Tyranitar can be worn down quite easily by these Pokemon over the course of the match if they manage to switch into play often, especially if entry hazards are on the field. When switching Mega Tyranitar into Pokemon such as Heatran, you should also be wary of Lava Plume and Toxic, which can significantly cripple Mega Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Tyranitar fits best on bulky offensive and balanced teams that appreciate its utility as a Stealth Rock setter, Pursuit trapper, and check to Pokemon like Tornadus-T, Heatran, and Mega Latias. Pokemon such as Kartana, Gliscor, and Rotom-W can take advantage of Mega Tyranitar's ability to Pursuit trap Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Mega Latias. Because of how easily Mega Tyranitar can be worn down over the course of the match, it's important to have entry hazard removal support from Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Tapu Fini. Sand Rush Excadrill benefits greatly from Mega Tyranitar's ability to set sand, enabling it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, while also acting as an entry hazard remover. Mega Tyranitar is relatively susceptible to Fairy-types such as Magearna, Mega Mawile, and Clefable, so checks to them such as Heatran, Toxapex, and Celesteela are very important. It also struggles against Ash-Greninja in particular, so checks like Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Tapu Fini make for good partners.</p> "

        "name": "Assault Vest",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rock Slide is used over Stone Edge as a Rock-type STAB option because it's much more reliable while still retaining necessary damage on key threats such as Volcarona, Mega Charizard Y, and Tornadus-T. While Crunch is the main Dark-type STAB move used on this set to deal consistent damage, Pursuit is necessary to prevent threats such as Mega Alakazam and Mega Latios from switching out. Earthquake is a solid coverage option that allows Tyranitar to threaten to OHKO Heatran and Magnezone while doing decent damage to threats such as Toxapex, Magearna, and opposing Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Assault Vest allows Tyranitar to become an effective check for many of the tier's most threatening special attackers such as Mega Charizard Y, Mega Alakazam, and Heatran. 224 HP EVs allow Tyranitar to avoid the 2HKO from Mega Latios's Earthquake—this investment in combination with maximum Special Defense investment allows Tyranitar to tank even some of the strongest special attacks in the tier such as +1 Savage Spin-Out from Volcarona with Assault Vest.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Avoid unnecessarily switching Tyranitar into Pokemon aside from the ones that it's needed to check, as it lacks reliable recovery and is prone to getting worn down into range of moves such as Corkscrew Crash from Heatran and Focus Blast from Mega Alakazam. In a similar vein, try to keep entry hazards off the field when switching in Tyranitar so that it doesn't get worn down as quickly and can do its job well. Try to wear down Pokemon such as Mega Latios and Mega Alakazam with your teammates so that you don't have to win a mind game in order to Pursuit trap them. If possible, try to sacrifice an expendable teammate when attempting to trap Mega Alakazam because Focus Blast can 2HKO Tyranitar as it switches in.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Assault Vest Tyranitar tends to find itself on teams that appreciate the role compression and teambuilding flexibility that the set provides. Teammates that can help Tyranitar heal throughout the match, such as Tapu Bulu and Wish Clefable, are very helpful because they allow you to play Tyranitar more aggressively throughout the match. Pokemon that can break through the opposing team when the likes of Mega Latios and Mega Alakazam have been removed, such as Heatran and Mega Charizard Y, make excellent teammates for Assault Vest Tyranitar. Entry hazard removal from Pokemon such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos is very useful, as entry hazards being off the field allows Tyranitar to switch around more freely throughout the game.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stone Edge is the most spammable move on the set, hitting even Pokemon that resist Rock for massive damage. The metagame's lack of switch-ins to powerful Rock-type moves increases its potency. Crunch is Tyranitar's secondary STAB move and hits many threats neutrally, making Tyranitar even harder to switch into safely. Pursuit makes Tyranitar a fearsome trapper, as any targets weak to Dark or less bulky and neutral are heavily damaged if not OHKOed upon switching out. Notable targets include Mega Latias, Mega Latios, and Choice-locked Tapu Lele. The final moveslot is fairly flexible. Earthquake allows Tyranitar to defeat certain Pokemon that resist its STAB attacks, such as Mega Mawile, Magearna, and Bisharp, while Superpower can be used to hit Steel-types extremely hard and has a high chance of OHKOing Chansey after Stealth Rock damage. Ice Punch destroys common switch-ins to Tyranitar such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Fire Punch hits Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn harder than any other coverage option and retains the ability to hit Mega Mawile and Magearna for super effective damage, but bear in mind that a neutral Stone Edge hits as hard as a 2x super effective Fire Punch.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The bulk investment allows Tyranitar to always avoid being OHKOed by a +1 Bug Buzz from Volcarona from full HP. It also guarantees that Moonblast from Choice Specs Tapu Lele will never OHKO Tyranitar. Maximum EVs in Attack and an Adamant nature to give Tyranitar the most potential to break through the opponent's team. The Speed investment allows Tyranitar to outspeed Adamant Mega Mawile. However, Tyranitar can opt for less Speed investment to hit certain benchmarks, such as 76 Speed EVs to outrun Specially Defensive Tapu Bulu. Tyranitar can alternatively run a Jolly nature with maximum EVs in Attack and Speed to outrun the likes of Rotom-W, Specially Defensive Heatran, unboosted Mega Swampert, and  uninvested Zapdos, however the lack of power can be unapealling. Choice Band makes Tyranitar extremely powerful, as its STAB combination is very difficult to switch into for offensive and defensive builds alike. It comes at the cost of locking Tyranitar into one move, however. Sand Stream buffs Tyranitar's Special Defense and thereby helps it switch into special attackers more easily. Partners that can sweep under sand appreciate it as well.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Band Tyranitar should primarily be used as a wallbreaker due to the incredible damage it can inflict with Stone Edge and Crunch. Pursuit should not be used as frequently because it is situational. As opponents will often be reluctant to switch Pursuit's targets in for fear of getting them trapped, Tyranitar's presence can be used to pressure opponents and keep momentum in your favor. Tyranitar's naturally high special bulk helps it check strong special attackers such as Mega Latios, Tapu Koko and Volcarona; however, Tyranitar must be kept healthy to avoid the KO from a boosted Giga Drain from Volcarona so it can KO with Stone Edge in return. In a pinch, Tyranitar is capable of surviving a +1 Giga Drain from Volcarona from full HP even without sand active.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tyranitar's best partners appreciate its ability to Pursuit trap their checks and counters. Mega Charizard Y, Keldeo, and other special attackers pressure opponents heavily in tandem with Choice Band Tyranitar, as common checks to special attackers such as Chansey and Assault Vest Tornadus-T are either obliterated by Tyranitar's STAB moves or weakened by Pursuit. By pressuring bulky foes such as Landorus-T, Tyranitar can give teammates like Mega Mawile opportunities to set up. Tyranitar itself is troubled by Fighting-types and fast offensive threats such as Keldeo and Garchomp; pairing it with strong Flying-, Psychic-, and Fairy-types can pressure them. Good options include Tapu Fini, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Lele. Earthquake switch-ins such as Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Tangrowth are very important because they account for Tyranitar's Ground-type weakness. Excadrill appreciates Tyranitar's sand, which enables it to sweep with Sand Rush. Mega Garchomp, which also appreciates sand, can form a powerful breaking core with Tyranitar. Notably, they both pressure Landorus-T heavily.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Mega Tyranitar's power, impressive bulk, and difficulty to revenge kill make it an effective user of Dragon Dance, outperforming non-Mega Tyranitar due to its increased Speed and defenses. Stone Edge is Mega Tyranitar's most powerful STAB move and hits much of the OU metagame for neutral or super effective damage. Ice Punch is run to smash would-be checks such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. The last moveslot can hold Fire Punch or Earthquake. Fire Punch punishes Ferrothorn and Scizor while preventing the need to risk a Stone Edge miss against other Steel-types. Alternatively, Earthquake lets Mega Tyranitar beat Bisharp, Magearna, and Mega Mawile more easily. In addition, it can 2HKO Toxapex without a boost and hits Keldeo for neutral damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Mega Tyranitar runs maximum Attack and Speed investment with a Jolly nature to make the most of its impressive base 164 Attack while outspeeding neutral- and positive-Speed natured base 70 Speed Pokemon such as Bisharp, Magearna, and defensive Garchomp. Sand Stream is the preferred ability because it buffs Tyranitar's Special Defense before it Mega Evolves, enabling it to take special hits more easily while setting up.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Tyranitar is best used as a mid- or late-game sweeper, as its longevity can be cut short by damage taken while setting up and sweeping. Prior to setting up, it is important to ensure that certain checks to Mega Tyranitar, such as revenge killers and Pokemon that resist its coverage, are removed and that necessary chip damage has been dealt so Mega Tyranitar can achieve OHKOs more easily. Setting up against offensive teams can be challenging, so it is best to bring Tyranitar in against something it would normally threaten out, such as Mega Latios, Heatran, or Choice-locked Tapu Lele, and proceed to Mega Evolve and boost with Dragon Dance. Bluffing a different item, such as a Choice Band, can make this simpler. Bulkier teams can fall to Mega Tyranitar once its defensive checks have been weakened sufficiently. When facing weather-based teams, it is best to hold off on Mega Evolving Tyranitar as opposed to losing it by setting up early in the game, as it can set sand repeatedly to prevent opposing weather sweepers from becoming dangerous.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tyranitar's presence prior to Mega Evolving can pressure opponents to be wary of sending in Pursuit-weak Pokemon, enabling you to play more aggressively. However, its multitude of weaknesses and need for prior damage to successfully sweep means that it struggles as a stand-alone attacker and requires plenty of support from its teammates. Tapu Fini provides Water- and Fighting-type resistances while keeping bulkier teams pressured with the combination of Taunt and Nature's Madness. It also keeps Mega Tyranitar safe from status with Misty Terrain. Ferrothorn can set up Stealth Rock or Spikes to help chip away at foes while checking Water- and Fairy-types for Tyranitar, but it shares a Fighting-type weakness with Tyranitar. Landorus-T is an excellent partner, as it resists Fighting-type attacks, is immune to Ground-type moves, inflicts chip damage with Rocky Helmet, and can pivot Tyranitar into battle via U-turn. Dual screens support boosts Mega Tyranitar's natural bulk to incredible levels and enables it to set up in front of OU's most powerful attackers such as offensive Landorus-T. Tapu Koko is a capable screen setter in OU.</p> "

  "Swampert": {
    "overview": "<p>Offensively, Swampert is the premier Mega Evolution choice on rain teams because of its Electric immunity. It also has the ability to break down conventional rain checks such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Mantine due to its secondary STAB attack, Earthquake, and its array of coverage moves such as Superpower and Stone Edge. Mega Swampert can also provide great role compression because it is a Stealth Rock user that beats Mega Sableye. Defensively, Mega Swampert opens holes to Pokemon rain is already weak to, most notably Ash-Greninja and Keldeo. Mega Swampert suffers the same problem with other bulky physical attackers, as it is prone to chip damage from Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, and Iron Barbs, meaning its bulk sometimes cannot be used practically. Mega Swampert is also dependent on rain to function, meaning it can only be used effectively when rain is active.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rain Dance is a good option so Mega Swampert can set up the rain itself rather than relying on Pelipper. Swampert can attempt a sweep by boosting its Attack with Power-Up Punch, but Swampert usually prefers an extra coverage than to boost its Attack in specific situations.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Most Water-types force out Mega Swampert due to the threat of their Scald burning it. Suicune, Alomomola, Mega Slowbro, and Pelipper are the most notable. Choice Scarf Keldeo outspeeds Adamant Mega Swampert and forces Mega Swampert out due to its powerful Hydro Pump. Physically defensive Rotom-W can come in on Mega Swampert with little fear and neuter it with Will-O-Wisp, and Mantine completely walls Mega Swampert lacking Stone Edge. A healthy physically defensive Tapu Fini can put Mega Swampert at a very low amount of HP with the combination of Nature's Madness and Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Tangrowth, Tapu Bulu, and Ferrothorn threaten Mega Swampert with their Grass-type STAB moves. Tapu Bulu, non-physically defensive Tangrowth, and Ferrothorn must watch out for coverage moves in Ice Punch and Superpower, however.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Mega Swampert is not unbelievably fast without a Jolly nature and the use of a Jolly nature makes Swampert much easier to deal with using Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Mew. Choice Scarf users such as Keldeo and Garchomp can outpace an Adamant Mega Swampert and take out a weakened Mega Swampert with their strong STAB attacks. Latios outpaces even Jolly variants and does massive damage to it using Draco Meteor. Mega Swampert can also be surprised by the use of Grass Knot on Choice Scarf users such as Nihilego and Greninja. Finally, Mega Alakazam traces Swift Swim and can take out a weakened Mega Swampert with Psychic or once again surprise it with Grass Knot.</p> <p><strong>Ash-Greninja: While Ash-Greninja cannot directly switch in, Water Shuriken is boosted in the rain and is capable of taking 75% of Mega Swampert's health, which is a common range of health it finds itself in because of how Mega Swampert is vulnerable to chip damage from Rocky Helmet and Pokemon it switches into such as Tapu Koko.</p> <p><strong>Removing Rain: Mega Swampert is slow and lacks a powerful Water-type attack outside of the rain. Tyranitar, Alolan Ninetales, and Mega Charizard Y change the weather, and the latter two can force Mega Swampert out due their STAB attacks and coverage.</p> ",

        "name": "Rain Sweeper",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Waterfall is Swampert's strongest move in the rain, and it is used over Aqua Tail because of its perfect accuracy and chance to flinch. Earthquake is Swampert's secondary STAB move, which is used to hit common nuisances to rain teams such as Toxapex and Tapu Fini. Ice Punch is the coverage move of choice to nail Dragon- and Grass-types such as Garchomp and Tapu Bulu while 2HKOing Assault Vest Tangrowth on the switch after Stealth Rock damage. Swampert has a unique niche on rain teams, as it is a Stealth Rock user that defeats Mega Sableye. Swampert can use another coverage move if this niche is not valued. Stone Edge prevents Mantine and Pelipper from walling Swampert, while avoiding Zapdos' Static, while Superpower can be used to KO Ferrothorn from a higher amount of health. Substitute can be used to ease prediction, conserving rain turns, and making Swampert harder to revenge kill. 8 Special Defense also lets Swampert's Substitute live Toxapex's rain-boosted Scald.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs are utilized to allow Mega Swampert to hit as hard and be as fast as possible. Damp is the preferred ability for its situational use of stopping Landorus-T and Azelf from using Explosion. An Adamant nature is preferred to enhance Swampert's breaking abilities. A Jolly nature is viable to outpace Choice Scarf Keldeo, a common threat to rain teams. Mega Swampert misses out on a lot of power, however.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>One of Mega Swampert's best traits as a Swift Swim user is its high bulk, yet it is generally best not to use this bulk because Mega Swampert will need its health to survive priority attacks from Pokemon such as Mega Mawile and Ash-Greninja and attacks from faster Choice Scarf users such as Keldeo and Garchomp. Mega Swampert already finds itself vulnerable to forms of chip damage such as Spikes, Rocky Helmet, and Iron Barbs, as well as weaker attacks such as Tapu Koko's U-turn and Mega Medicham's Fake Out. Mega Swampert should also be kept away from status moves, as they make it useless or easier to deal when trying to dance around rain turns through continuous switching.</p> <p>When Swampert gets in for free, it should be played based on what the opponent's Mega Swampert checks are. If the opposition has solid checks to it, Mega Swampert should be focused on weakening its checks using its plethora of coverage moves to support a possible secondary sweeper such as Kingdra or Ash-Greninja. If the matchup is more in Mega Swampert's favor, play patiently and use teammates such as Ferrothorn and Tapu Koko more often, as Mega Swampert will want to stay healthy as possible. This is especially important if one decides to run a Jolly nature, as it will not be forced out by Pokemon such as Keldeo and Garchomp in an effort to conserve its health. Finally, Stealth Rock should be used on a predicted switch or if there is a Pokemon that indefinitely walls Mega Swampert such as physically defensive Tangrowth or Mantine. It is also best to use Stealth Rock against Sableye stall teams once Swampert has conditioned the opponent into thinking it will not use Stealth Rock. A mistimed Stealth Rock against Mega Sableye can spell doom for Swampert's team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pelipper is a mandatory teammate because it provides free rain with its ability Drizzle while checking Keldeo, one of the best checks to Mega Swampert. It also creates free turns for Mega Swampert with its slow U-turn and by baiting in Electric-types such as Zapdos and Tapu Koko. Choice Specs Pelipper in particular breaks down a lot of Pokemon Swampert struggles with, making a Jolly nature more affordable. A secondary rain abuser, preferably Kingdra or Ash-Greninja, is also recommended, as the combination of Mega Swampert and one of them can overwhelm a lot of rain checks. If Ash-Greninja is used, it is best to use Spikes, as Mega Swampert appreciates the hazard support so Pokemon such as Mew and Tapu Bulu can no longer safely switch in. Ferrothorn is a great utility Pokemon on rain teams, as its Fire-type weakness is halved, and it can set up Spikes or even Stealth Rock, the latter freeing up a moveslot on Mega Swampert. Landorus-T also frees up a moveslot for Mega Swampert due to it being a powerful offensive Stealth Rock user. It also removes bulky Grass- and Water-types with Supersonic Skystrike.</p> <p>Swampert appreciates some way to break Tangrowth, so Tornadus-T is a great teammate, wearing down Pokemon Mega Swampert struggles with such as Rotom-W, Tapu Fini, Ferrothorn, and Mantine. Tapu Koko is also a good teammate, as it gets a perfectly accurate Thunder under rain, and it provides free switches for Mega Swampert with U-turn. Tapu Lele is another good teammate, blocking priority and switching into a lot of Pokemon Swampert struggles with, namely Tangrowth and bulky Water-types such as Mantine and Mega Slowbro.</p> "

Pelipper's solid STAB moves and wide support movepool mean it can assist rain teams in two ways. On one hand, Pelipper can run a defensive Damp Rock set to extend rain turns and provide help its teammates switch in freely with its slow U-turn. On the other, Pelipper can break down conventional rain checks such as Toxapex and Ferrothorn with a Choice Specs set. Pelipper does have mediocre stats, however, which means it is easy to pressure and keep out with Pokemon such as Ash-Greninja, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Koko. Pelipper loses one-on-one to Tyranitar and Mega Charizard Y, which replace the rain with their own weather. Pelipper is also weak to Stealth Rock, which makes it an even more unreliable Defogger because it has to switch into the entry hazard to remove it.</p> ",

U-turn is a fantastic move on a slow Pokemon such as Pelipper because it provides a rain sweeper a free switch. Roost is used to conserve Pelipper's health, which is instrumental to keep rain active. Defog is the preferred move in the last slot to remove entry hazards, most notably Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes, that are problems for many of Pelipper's grounded teammates. However, Hurricane can be used on teams with secondary entry hazard removal so Pelipper can punish Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss. Alternatively, Scald can be dropped for Hurricane instead, but Scald's utility in burning annoying rain checks such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex makes it hard to forego. Pursuit can be used to OHKO Shedinja, one of the only counters to Manaphy. Finally, Knock Off can be run to remove items such as Tangrowth's Assault Vest and Chansey's Eviolite for teammates.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread and nature allow Pelipper to tank a Supersonic Skystrike from Landorus-T, +2 Acrobatics from Hawlucha, and avoid the 2HKO from Choice Scarf Keldeo's Hydro Pump. Special defense investment also helps Pelipper comfortably U-turn out of Mega Charizard Y. Damp Rock is the best item on this set because Pelipper's ability Drizzle will summon eight turns of rain as opposed to five.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Pelipper is a fine choice as a lead to set up rain right away. Pelipper is often paired with Mega Swampert, so leading with Pelipper does not lose much momentum if the opponent decides to lead with an Electric-type Pokemon. Pelipper should be played conservatively and should only be sacrificed for rain turns if its teammates can win the game with the remaining turns of rain. Because Pelipper is so important for rain teams to function, it should scout out potential Z-Moves that could eliminate it, such as Continental Crush from Landorus-T and Bloom Doom from Heatran. Roost should be used to keep Pelipper healthy so it can come in on Stealth Rock safely. It is often best to use U-turn more than Scald to keep momentum, unless a threat such as Celesteela or Ferrothorn needs to be burned so Pelipper's teammates can handle it better.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Swift Swim users such as Mega Swampert, Kingdra, and Qwilfish take advantage of the rain that Pelipper sets. Mega Swampert has great synergy with Pelipper, as it can switch into Electric-type attacks, while Pelipper can take on Choice Scarf Keldeo and Mega Charizard Y for Mega Swampert. Qwilfish has great offensive synergy with Pelipper due to its ability to absorb Toxic Spikes. Ash-Greninja is another great teammate because Battle Bond is much easier to activate in rain, and its Water Shuriken and Hydro Pump have insane damage output after its transformation. Tornadus-T and Tapu Koko make good use of Pelipper's rain to fire off 100% accurate Hurricanes and Thunders. They can also support their team by pressuring bulkier teams with Taunt and regaining lost momentum with U-turn. Mega Garchomp is a good potential teammate, as it appreciates the rain boost to Aqua Tail in order to remove one of its best checks in defensive Landorus-T. Ferrothorn is a great teammate because its Fire-type weakness is reduced under rain, allowing it to stay in on Pokemon such as Zapdos. It can then support rain sweepers with Spikes and Knock Off. Mega Scizor and Latios are also good teammates that allow Pelipper to run another move over Defog. Mega Scizor brings more momentum to the table with U-turn, while Latios provides a secondary check to Keldeo and Mega Charizard Y, removing a lot of pressure from Pelipper.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Despite Pelipper's average Special Attack stat, this set is very threatening due to Pelipper's ability to summon rain and access to high-Base Power attacks. Hydro Pump's power is increased in rain, which allows Pelipper to 2HKO some of the most specially defensive Pokemon in the tier, such as Celesteela and Assault Vest Magearna. Its massive damage output in general allows Pelipper to OHKO Pokemon such as Greninja, Reuniclus, and Mew. Hurricane complements Hydro Pump as a 100% accurate Flying-type STAB move under rain that eliminates or 2HKOes nuisances to rain teams in Tangrowth, Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Mantine. Surf can be used when Pelipper does not need to risk a Hydro Pump miss, although Knock Off is an option to let Pelipper 2HKO Chansey with Hydro Pump. U-turn provides momentum for teammates when Pelipper does not need to waste a turn staying in itself. Scald seems like an appealing option over Surf, but Pelipper should focus more on wallbreaking than on fishing for burns. Defog can be run for emergency entry hazard removal, but using U-turn or a more powerful attack is usually more productive.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs, Choice Specs, and a Modest nature are used so Pelipper can hit as hard as possible. There is no point in using a Rash or Mild nature because U-turn is there for its utility and not its power. The remaining EVs are invested into Speed in order to let Pelipper outpace and threaten Pokemon such as Mega Mawile, neutral-natured Tyranitar, Magnezone, and Mega Scizor.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Pelipper is very frail without defensive investment, fainting to many special attacks such as Greninja's Choice Specs-boosted Dark Pulse and Tapu Lele's Psychic. Because of this, Pelipper should come in on Pokemon it has a good matchup against defensively, such as Mega Charizard Y, defensive Landorus-T, Mega Scizor, and Mew. Pelipper can use VoltTurn support to get in, too. While Hydro Pump is Pelipper's strongest attack, Hurricane is usually more threatening early-game because it threatens a lot of defensive pivots in the tier such as Toxapex and Tangrowth. While this variant of Pelipper only brings five turns of rain, it should still be preserved because teammates such as Mega Swampert and Kingdra depend on it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Swift Swim users such as Mega Swampert and Kingdra are great teammates because Pelipper breaks down a lot of bulky Grass- and Water-types and provides rain for them. Mega Swampert also checks Electric-type attackers that threaten Pelipper. Ash-Greninja is a phenomenal teammate that appreciates Pokemon such as Toxapex and Tangrowth removed or weakened. Its ability Battle Bond is much easier to activate in rain, and it is nigh impossible to stop after its transformation, capable of OHKOing Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu and Garchomp with Hydro Pump and Water Shuriken, respectively. Tapu Koko and Tornadus-T take advantage of the rain because their Thunder and Hurricane become a 100% accurate. They can create a stallbreaking core with Pelipper as well due to their access to Taunt. Tapu Koko can also U-turn out of bulky Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss for Pelipper to take advantage of. This set requires entry hazard removal because Stealth Rock limits the number of times Pelipper can set up rain. Latios and Mega Scizor are prime options for hazard removers. Ferrothorn is a solid teammate because its Fire-type weakness is reduced under rain, and it can set up entry hazards to support rain sweepers.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Breloom might seem like an interesting choice for a bulky Grass-type thanks to its unique combination of Spore, Leech Seed, and Poison Heal, and it also packs a notable offensive presence thanks to Focus Punch, which benefits from Breloom's naturally high Attack and Substitute. However, it is unable to set up against prominent Pokemon in the tier such as Tapu Bulu, Tapu Koko, Gliscor, Tapu Fini, and Mega Sableye, which can all prevent Breloom from using Spore by virtue of their typing and abilities and take very little to no damage from Focus Punch. Overall, Breloom's dependency on good matchup makes it inconsistent and hard to justify using over other Grass-types that can successfully check the majority of Water-, Ground-, and Electric-types in the tier.</p> ",
    "sets": [{"name": "SubSeed", "description": "<p>What separates Breloom from other users of Leech Seed, such as Serperior and Ferrothorn, is Breloom's access to Spore, which gives it a free turn to set up Leech Seed or Substitute, as well as Poison Heal, which protects Breloom from status and provides it with another source of reliable recovery. However, Breloom has a hard time setting up after one of the opposing Pokemon has been put to sleep, as it can easily be checked right after by faster threats that do not fear Focus Punch, such as Tornadus-T, Tapu Lele, and Mega Latias. While Breloom's niche and tool set are unique, it is not as effective as a defensive Grass-type compared to other Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu, Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss, all of which have a better matchup against a broader range of threats and are therefore easier to fit on teams.</p> "}],

  "Sableye": {
    "overview": "<p>In conjunction with its Dark / Ghost typing, Mega Sableye's solid defensive stats allow it to act as one of the only switch-ins to Mega Medicham in the OU metagame. Mega Sableye's ability Magic Bounce further bolsters its defensive capabilities by reflecting troublesome entry hazards and status moves. Mega Sableye essentially invalidates any passive entry hazard setter aside from Clefable, making it very disruptive versus bulkier teams that rely on stacking entry hazards to do consistent damage. Moreover, Mega Sableye has access to instant recovery, greatly extending its longevity throughout a battle. Unfortunately, Mega Sableye is rather passive due to its atrocious offensive stats, so it is limited to being used on stall teams, where losing momentum is less detrimental. It also cannot take advantage of Prankster Will-O-Wisp or Recover and Mega Evolve on the same turn. Fairy-type Pokemon such as Mega Diancie, Magearna, and Clefable are all very threatening to Mega Sableye, as they can do huge damage with their STAB super effective Fairy-type attacks while also resisting Knock Off and not being greatly hindered by Will-O-Wisp.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Fake Out is an alternative option to Protect that is capable of doing damage; however, it is usually the inferior option, as Sableye cannot use it to safely Mega Evolve versus grounded foes while Psychic Terrain is up. Imprison can be run to prevent Reuniclus, a massive threat to most stall teams, from using Recover, effectively neutering it. However, Mega Sableye usually can't forego any of its moves.  Mega Sableye can also effectively run a Calm Mind set utilizing either of its STAB moves and Will-O-Wisp, but due to its awful Speed stat and the omnipresence of Fairy-type Pokemon, this set struggles to sweep most teams.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Fairy-type Pokemon such as Magearna, Mega Mawile, Mega Diancie, Clefable, and Tapu Lele can all do massive damage to Mega Sableye with their Fairy-type attacks. These Pokemon can all use Mega Sableye as setup fodder as well, making them particularly dangerous.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Fire-type Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X and Heatran are immune to Will-O-Wisp and can either use Mega Sableye as setup fodder or do large amounts of damage to it with a powerful STAB attack.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers: Although Will-O-Wisp can deter many setup sweepers from attempting to boost versus Mega Sableye, Pokemon such as Swords Dance Garchomp, Swords Dance Landorus-T, and Volcarona can circumvent this with Substitute or an outright immunity to the move in Volcarona's case.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers: Strong wallbreakers such as Kartana, Choice Specs Keldeo, Hoopa-U, and Mega Charizard Y are all very threatening to Mega Sableye, as they are powerful enough to 2HKO it with their respective STAB attacks.</p> ",

        "name": "Utility",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Knock Off is useful for removing a foe's item and allows Mega Sableye to do direct damage. Foul Play can also be used in this slot in order to do more damage to physically offensive Pokemon, but Knock Off's utility is usually more important. Will-O-Wisp deters physical attackers such as Landorus-T, Mega Mawile, and Mega Pinsir from switching into Mega Sableye, as well as preventing these Pokemon from using it as setup fodder. Recover allows Mega Sableye to consistently check Pokemon such as Mega Medicham and Mega Alakazam throughout a battle. Lastly, Protect ensures Mega Sableye can Mega Evolve safely at any point during a battle and is also useful when scouting for moves versus Choice-locked Pokemon like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment and a Careful nature allow Mega Sableye to avoid being 2HKOed by uninvested Magma Storm from Heatran while also being able to protect Mega Sableye from various special attackers such as Protean Greninja and Mega Alakazam. An alternate EV spread of maximum HP and Defense investment with an Impish nature can be used in order for Mega Sableye to check powerful physical attackers such as Mega Medicham. Prankster allows Sableye to burn a threatening foe with priority Will-O-Wisp before Mega Evolving. Sablenite is necessary in order for Sableye to evolve into Mega Sableye.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Switch Mega Sableye into entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Toxapex to reflect any entry hazards they attempt to set with Magic Bounce. Knock Off and Will-O-Wisp are very spammable moves and should be used frequently when Mega Sableye does not need to recover its HP. Although Mega Sableye has immense bulk and a reliable recovery move, its inability to passively recover HP with Leftovers means it can be whittled down quickly. It is important to Mega Evolve Sableye in the early stages of a battle so it can properly prevent the opponent from setting up hazards later on.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Sableye fits best on stall teams that can afford to lose momentum. Therefore, Pokemon such as Toxapex, Chansey, and Clefable make for solid teammates. Clefable is an excellent partner in particular, as with Unaware it can wall sweepers such as Swords Dance Garchomp and Volcarona that attempt to use Mega Sableye as setup fodder. Mega Sableye can reliably prevent an opponent from setting up their own hazards, so Pokemon that despise them such as defensive Volcarona can be good teammates. Steel-types such as Heatran and Celesteela also have natural synergy with Mega Sableye, as they can combat the Fairy-types that threaten it.</p> "

  "Mawile": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Mawile is one of the strongest breakers in the OU metagame. Solid coverage options like Knock Off, Ice Punch, Fire Fang, and Thunder Punch alongside a setup move in Swords Dance make Mega Mawile impossible to deal with defensively, while its access to Sucker Punch gives it the ability to threaten offensive teams. Its typing, combined with Intimidate, grants it many opportunities to either set up or just attack against common Pokemon such as Clefable, Tapu Bulu, and Reuniclus, allowing it to punch holes in teams relatively consistently. However, because of its very poor Speed, Mega Mawile heavily relies on Sucker Punch to deal with faster threats, which allows Pokemon like Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Ash-Greninja to revenge kill it relatively consistently; hence, it struggles more against offensive teams that can overwhelm it before it can get a strong hit off. While Mega Mawile's typing is great, it does give Mega Mawile two weaknesses to extremely common types, namely Ground and Fire, making it vulnerable to common Pokemon such as Heatran, Landorus-T, and Garchomp, which are also bulky enough to take a +2 Sucker Punch. Finally, Mega Mawile has slight issues with picking correct coverage, as it can't always run what it wants.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Stealth Rock is a niche move choice that's generally a pretty bad move to run on a Pokemon like Mega Mawile because it needs all the coverage it can get, but it can work if you absolutely need to run it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats: Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Choice Band Tyranitar, Tapu Koko, and Ash-Greninja can take a +2 Sucker Punch and retaliate for an OHKO with their respective STAB or coverage moves, but none of them can really switch into Mega Mawile. Tapu Lele gets a special mention for Psychic Terrain, which prevents Mega Mawile from using Sucker Punch.</p> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp: Will-O-Wisp from Pokemon such as Heatran, Mew, and Rotom-W outspeed and cripple Mega Mawile by halving its Attack, meaning Mega Mawile must watch out for them.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Walls: Pokemon such as Mega Venusaur, Toxapex, and Skarmory can wall Mega Mawile depending on its coverage, but they aren't guaranteed counters by any means. Physically defensive Volcarona can also be quite annoying without entry hazards up, as it isn't weak to any of Mega Mawile's coverage moves, consistently switching into it and threatening it out with a Fire-type STAB move, and it also has reliable recovery.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Sucker Punch gives Mega Mawile the means to hit faster Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Mega Alakazam, and Kartana. Knock Off allows Mega Mawile to net neutral coverage on Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex, usually OHKOing both after a layer of Spikes at +2. It also has nearly perfect neutral coverage with Play Rough. Thunder Punch can be used over Knock Off for its immediate damage on Pokemon such as Celesteela and Gyarados, and it also slightly eases the Toxapex matchup.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>164 Speed EVs allow Mega Mawile to outspeed Sassy Mega Venusaur and everything below it. Intimidate softens up physical blows and gives Mega Mawile more setup opportunities.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Mawile is best used to soften up defensive teams early- to mid-game so that the rest of its team has an easier time dealing with the remaining Pokemon. Against offensive teams, it's advised to attempt to play aggressively, such as bringing it in on a predicted double switch, so that you can get value out of Mega Mawile in this matchup. Additionally, it's advised to only set up late-game, as early-game, Mega Mawile's checks will be too healthy for it to sweep through them. Mega Mawile is also good at wearing down Pokemon such as Heatran and Landorus-T so that the rest of its team can more easily deal with them. This is especially true with entry hazards on the field. Before Mega Evolving, Mawile can be useful with Intimidate pivoting to help soften blows from physical attackers like Hawlucha, Gyarados, Mega Heracross, and Kartana.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and both Greninja formes are good partners, as they can grant Mega Mawile an easier time breaking through defensive cores and wearing down Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Toxapex. Additionally, Spikes and Stealth Rock can significantly aid Mega Mawile in sweeping late-game, as they can potentially put Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Ash-Greninja in range of +2 Sucker Punch. Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth pair well with Mega Mawile, as they resist Ground and therefore can check Pokemon such as Garchomp and defensive Landorus-T. U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Landorus-T, Tapu Koko, Tornadus-T, and Rotom-W pair well with Mega Mawile, as they can bring it safely so that it does not have to take any unnecessary damage, thereby increasing its longevity and ability to wallbreak. Rotom-W is an especially notable teammate, as it resists Fire and is immune to Ground, which allows it to check Pokemon that Mega Mawile struggles against, such as Landorus-T and Heatran; Rotom-W also has a tendency to bait in Grass-types like Tangrowth and Ferrothorn, allowing it to pivot out with Volt Switch and give Mega Mawile an opportunity to wallbreak. Choice Specs Magnezone can be a pretty good partner for Swords Dance Mega Mawile; Mega Scizor can be a nuisance to it, as can Ferrothorn if Mega Mawile chooses to run Thunder Punch, and Choice Specs Magnezone is pretty reliable at trapping both of these threats. Serperior is also a good teammate because Serperior can help wear down Heatran for Mega Mawile, and vice versa. Serperior is also great at spreading paralysis with Glare, which helps Mega Mawile secure setup opportunities and outspeed the opposing team. Dual screens Tapu Koko can provide momentum for Mega Mawile and also help grant it more setup opportunities to potentially sweep against any team archetype. Finally, Mega Mawile is a must-have on Trick Room teams, as it's nearly impossible to stop if it can manage to get a Swords Dance off under Trick Room.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Play Rough is Mega Mawile's strongest move with good neutral coverage. Thunder Punch hits Pokemon such as Toxapex, Celesteela, and Skarmory extremely hard. Sucker Punch allows Mega Mawile to hit faster Pokemon like Mega Alakazam and Kartana. Ice Punch is an option that OHKOes Choice Scarf variants of Landorus-T and has a minimum damage of 83% to defensive variants, alongside hitting other threats like Zapdos, Tangrowth, and Hippowdon hard. Brick Break can OHKO offensive Heatran variants and deal significant damage to more defensive ones. Furthermore, it also hits Ferrothorn. Fire Fang's main use is in its ability to OHKO Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and, after entry hazards, Magnezone. Iron Head is a 100% accurate alternative to Play Rough that nets super effective coverage on Clefable and also hits Mega Venusaur neutrally, but it is slightly weaker and generally covers less.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>164 Speed EVs allow Mega Mawile to outspeed Skarmory and every Pokemon below it. If running Play Rough, 160 HP / 252 Atk / 96 Spe is an option to get the jump on Celesteela while making Mega Mawile more bulky. Intimidate is the pre-Mega ability of choice, as it gives Mega Mawile additional chances to attack against foes such as Gyarados and Hawlucha. Hyper Cutter can also be used to ignore Intimidate from Landorus-T, but it has limited use otherwise.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against defensive teams, attempt to get Mega Mawile in as much as possible so it can punch holes with its great power and coverage. You must play aggressively against offensive teams in order to maximize Mega Mawile's potential, since it would normally be too pressured to get any damage off. Good ways to get Mega Mawile in against an offense team would be by double switching or bringing it in via U-turn or Volt Switch. Make sure to predict whenever the opponent tries to maneuver around Mega Mawile's coverage so that you can get the most value out of it. This set is capable of hitting a large part of the metagame super effectively; thus, it is advised to be very aggressive with this set, as it's quite prediction reliant and can be extremely deadly if played correctly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard setters like Clefable, Ash-Greninja, and Landorus-T are great partners because they can soften up the opposing team for Mega Mawile to wallbreak more easily. Volt Switch and U-turn users like Rotom-W, Magnezone, Tapu Koko, and Tornadus-T are excellent partners because they can bring Mega Mawile in safely for it to punch holes, preventing any unnecessary damage to Mega Mawile. Magnezone can even trap Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Celesteela so that Mega Mawile does not have to take residual damage when KOing them. Grass-types like Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu make for excellent partners because of their ability to switch into Pokemon such as defensive Landorus-T and Garchomp, which are normally offensive checks to Mega Mawile. Since this Mega Mawile set lacks Sucker Punch, fast offensive Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T,  Ash-Greninja, and Weavile are good teammates for their ability to pressure offensive builds. Pokemon such as Shed Shell Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Rotom-W can help Mega Mawile out against Heatran, which Mega Mawile lacking Fighting-type coverage cannot deal with. Mega Mawile can also be used as a deadly attacker on Trick Room teams, OHKOing a surprising amount of the metagame and 2HKOing almost everything else.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute significantly eases prediction with Mega Mawile, protects it from Clefable's and Chansey's Thunder Wave, and enables it to run Focus Punch to deal with Steel-types such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Magnezone without any drawbacks. Thunder Punch is run to deal with Toxapex and Celesteela. Ice Punch is really important to hit Ground- and Grass-types such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, Tangrowth, and Tapu Bulu.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>144 HP EVs prevent Mega Mawile's Substitute from being KOed by Ferrothorn's Gyro Ball after Intimidate. 112 Speed EVs are run to outspeed Celesteela. Outspeeding Skarmory is not important because Mega Mawile can simply use Focus Punch to force it into using Roost. Intimidate is preferred over Hyper Cutter so that Mega Mawile has a better chance at taking a hit from physical attackers such as Mega Gyarados and Hawlucha.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Mawile is best used to smash through classic defensive cores such as Gliscor + Ferrothorn and Toxapex + Celesteela. You should switch Mega Mawile in on predicted switches from Pokemon like Weavile, Tapu Bulu, and Tornadus-T, which it can easily pressure out. From there, Mega Mawile can often afford to set up a Substitute for safety. There's often not much need to predict offensively with Mega Mawile, as using Substitute on a switch gives it a lot of freedom to attack what's in front of it. You should be wary of chip damage, however, because between damage from entry hazards, Rocky Helmet, and setting up a Substitute, Mega Mawile can be worn down quite quickly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Clefable, and Tapu Lele really appreciate Mega Mawile's ability to beat Heatran. Clefable especially makes for a great teammate, as it can support Mega Mawile with Wish, and its Calm Mind sets become much more threatening with Heatran out of the way. Despite Mega Mawile's ability to beat Heatran with a Substitute up, it's still important to pack checks like Garchomp, Gastrodon, and Rotom-W for it because it is still able to pressure Mega Mawile through aggressive switches. Mega Mawile benefits greatly from Spikes setters such as Ash-Greninja, Ferrothorn, and Greninja, as it can force many switches. Tapu Bulu and Mega Mawile also synergize well together; Tapu Bulu is able to set Grassy Terrain for Mega Mawile, granting it passive recovery while weakening Earthquake, while Mega Mawile can take advantage of Tornadus-T. U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Tornadus-T, Rotom-W, and Tapu Koko can generate momentum, which Mega Mawile can use to switch into play.</p> "

Its pure Steel typing, gigantic Defense stat, and ability Filter also allow it to deal with some other of the metagame's most common and dangerous physical attackers such as Choice-locked Kartana, both Tyranitar formes, and Mega Pinsir. With a high base Attack stat, Mega Aggron is also able to pressure some other threats to stall teams, such as Clefable and Mega Diancie, unlike stall's other Mega Evolution option in Mega Sableye. Furthermore, its superb movepool makes Mega Aggron capable of using various practical moves in the last moveslot, letting it check different threats depending on the needs of the team it is on. Unfortunately, Mega Aggron needs hard support in form of Wish from its teammates to keep healthy due to its lack of reliable recovery, which distinguishes it from Mega Sableye and even Mega Slowbro. Even with a damage-reducing ability, Mega Aggron's Special Defense is not always sufficient, making it struggle against stronger special attackers such as Firium Z Heatran, Focus Blast Magearna, and Fightinium Z Tapu Lele.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rest is an option to make Mega Aggron less dependent on Wish support, allowing it to keep its health high during the match, but the drawback of being asleep for two turns can render the move worthless, as it lets setup sweepers use Mega Aggron as setup fodder.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-type Pokemon: Bulky Water-type Pokemon, like Rotom-W, Gastrodon, and Alomomola, are easily capable of crippling Mega Aggron with chip damage or a Scald burn, while only fearing the rare Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon: Despite not being able to switch in safely, Heatran can pose a big threat to Mega Aggron, OHKOing it easily with Inferno Overdrive. Volcarona, especially its bulky set, can use Mega Aggron as setup fodder, and while it isn't the biggest problem to stall teams, Mega Charizard Y is capable of OHKOing Mega Aggron with Flamethrower with ease.</p> <p><strong>Special Attacking Wallbreakers: Hydreigon can easily 2HKO Mega Aggron with Black Hole Eclipse followed by Earth Power, and pre-transformed Ash-Greninja can 2HKO even the bulkiest variant of Mega Aggron with a Choice Specs-boosted Hydro Pump, not being OHKOed by anything Mega Aggron normally carries.</p> <p><strong>Status: If burned, Mega Aggron struggles to pressure its targets, such as Tornadus-T, Heatran, and Mega Mawile, leaving it unable to function well for the rest of the game.

At +2, Garchomp can OHKO a Rough Skin-weakened Mega Aggron with Earthquake. If Mega Aggron lacks Fire Punch, it falls victim to Mega Scizor and Kartana instead. Taunt Gyarados and Mega Gyarados can both use Mega Aggron as a setup fodder as well. Manaphy, Keldeo, and Double Dance Reuniclus also find almost-free opportunities to set up against Mega Aggron, as most of its moves don't bother them.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Heavy Slam gives Mega Aggron the ability to OHKO three huge threats to stall teams in Tapu Lele and Mega Diancie, as well as OHKO Clefable with little chip damage and 2HKO Tornadus-T and Mega Latios. Earthquake aims to hit Heatran, Mega Mawile, and Toxapex, relieving the pressure that all of them put on the rest of the team. It also can be used to hit Magnezone, in the case that Mega Aggron gets trapped by it. Ice Punch 2HKOes offensive Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor, which all take minimal damage from Mega Aggron's Heavy Slam, threaten Mega Aggron with super effective Ground-type STAB moves, and can pose a threat to stall teams depending on the set. Fire Punch has the same objective but instead targets Kartana, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn, achieving a 2HKO on all of them while having a favorable chance to OHKO the former. Protect helps Mega Aggron scout moves and waste either PP from the opposing team or turns from weather or screens. It can also serve as a way to make Mega Medicham lose half of its health by missing High Jump Kick, making it much easier to deal with. Toxic puts Tangrowth, Zapdos, and Rotom-W on a timer, since they aren't bothered by Mega Aggron's other moves.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP EVs, 200 Special Defense EVs, and a Careful nature allow Mega Aggron to endure two Psychics from Choice Specs Tapu Lele under Psychic Terrain without Stealth Rock damage, while 56 Attack EVs let it OHKO maximum HP Heatran with Earthquake almost every time. The remaining EVs are put into Speed to let Mega Aggron outspeed uninvested base 50s, such as Chansey and Alolan Muk. An offensive spread of 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD and an Adamant nature can be used in order to OHKO Garchomp and Gliscor with Ice Punch after Stealth Rock damage and deal more damage with Heavy Slam against the likes of Tornadus-T and Reuniclus, but the lack of special bulk investment can be detrimental in some situations.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to lead with Aggron, especially if the last move that you are using is Protect, and Mega Evolve as soon as possible in order to get rid of its poor defensive typing. If it is not possible to Mega Evolve Aggron on the first turn, try to bring Aggron in with a free switch, as even a resisted special move can make Aggron lose a lot of its health and consequently make it more dependent on Wish to heal. Avoid letting Mega Aggron's HP get too low; if that occurs, Mega Aggron can become unable to pivot into the Pokemon that it normally could. When pivoting, try to bring it in against special attackers that fear and can't do much against it such as Tornadus-T without Focus Blast and Mega Latios or against physical attackers such as Mega Pinsir and Weavile. Entry hazards, specially Spikes, can be somewhat detrimental to Mega Aggon, as it turns some 3HKOs against it turn into 2HKOs, such as Offensive Landorus-T's Earthquake and Choice Specs Tapu Lele's Psychic, leaving it unable to pivot into those threats. Therefore, try to keep them off your side of the field in order to preserve Mega Aggron's ability to consistently swallow hits. Mega Aggron's ability to pressure opposing hazard setters, such as Clefable and Mega Diancie, must be used as much as possible, so try to predict the opponent switching one of them in and double switch into them; since Mega Aggron can OHKO the former with little chip damage and outright eliminate the latter with ease, they will be discouraged from attempting to set up hazards. However, beware of Mega Diancie's Earth Power, as it can weaken Mega Aggron to a point where it can no longer switch in on threats without the risk of being KOed. Also, be wary of switching in on coverage moves from Mega Mawile and Tapu Lele; for example, pivoting in on Focus Punch Mawile will make Mega Aggron lose more than half of its health, while pivoting in on Focus Blast Tapu Lele will result in Mega Aggron getting 2HKOed, and in both cases Mega Aggron will be unable to check the threats it used to. With this, scouting for those moves is fundamental.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As Mega Aggron lacks a reliable form of recovery, Wish support is almost mandatory on teams with it. Chansey, Clefable, and Jirachi are all available and able to fit well on stall teams, with Chansey being the most effective, since its Wish heals all of Mega Aggron's HP, while Clefable forms a good Steel / Fairy core with it. Also, Chansey is a formidable counter to most special wallbreakers and sweepers, including Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona, beating them with ease for Mega Aggron. Entry hazard removers, specifically Zapdos and Mew, are good partners, as both check or counter some of Mega Aggron's checks, such as Celesteela in the case of Zapdos and Mega Medicham in Mew's situation, while keeping the field clear, making Mega Aggron's job of checking Pokemon easier. Since you're forgoing using Mega Sableye in the team's Mega slot, this kind of support is more indispensable than normal. Cleric support, or even a status absorber, is crucial to Mega Aggron teams. Chansey and Clefable can provide Heal Bell support to heal status, while Gliscor can pivot into status inducers, preventing other targets. Lastly, Buzzwole is an excellent partner to Mega Aggron, since it can pivot into the physical attackers that still can pose a threat to Mega Aggron, such as Tapu Bulu, Garchomp, Gliscor, and Mega Heracross.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Pure Power doubles Mega Medicham's Attack stat, making it one of the most powerful wallbreakers in the OU tier. Powerful STAB attacks in High Jump Kick and Zen Headbutt in conjunction with solid coverage moves such as Thunder Punch and Ice Punch make Mega Medicham even more challenging to switch into. Mega Medicham's base 100 Speed stat allows it to outpace Heatran, Rotom-W, Tapu Lele, and Landorus-T, among other threatening Pokemon. Mega Medicham also has access to priority moves such as Fake Out and Bullet Punch, which help patch up its only decent Speed stat and allow it to pick off faster offensive Pokemon such as Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Gengar. Mega Medicham's relatively low Speed stat alongside very poor bulk makes it rather easy to revenge kill. Despite Mega Medicham's power, it has issues breaking through bulky Psychic-types such as the prevalent Mew, as well as Reuniclus and Mega Slowbro.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mega Medicham has no viable other options.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Ghost-type Pokemon such as Mega Sableye and Gengar are immune to Mega Medicham's High Jump Kick, and can also hit it for super effective damage with their Ghost-type STAB moves. Mega Sableye is particularly bothersome for Mega Medicham, as it is immune to both of its STAB moves and can burn Mega Medicham with Will-O-Wisp.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fake Out deals chip damage and allows Mega Medicham to revenge kill weakened offensive threats such as Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Mega Alakazam. High Jump Kick is an incredibly hard-hitting Fighting-type STAB move, dealing immense damage to any Pokemon that does not resist it and even some that do. Ice Punch provides solid coverage alongside High Jump Kick, nailing Flying-types such as Landorus-T, Zapdos, and Tornadus-T for super effective damage, as well as 2HKOing Mega Latias. Zen Headbutt completes Mega Medicham's dual STAB and allows it to break through Poison-types such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Mega Venusaur. Thunder Punch can also be used in this slot in order to hit bulky Water-types such as Tapu Fini, Slowbro, and Gyarados for super effective damage while still nailing Toxapex. Thunder Punch is best used in tandem with Tapu Koko, as Electric Terrain boosts its power, allowing Mega Medicham to do huge damage to traditional counters such as Mega Sableye. Lastly, Bullet Punch is an alternative option to further alleviate Mega Medicham's rather poor Speed stat, and it works particularly well with Fake Out for revenge killing weakened faster threats. It's also very useful for OHKOing Mega Diancie, which otherwise forces Mega Medicham out.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed investment allow Mega Medicham to hit as hard and as fast as possible. A Jolly nature is preferred in order to outspeed Pokemon such as Tapu Lele, Landorus-T, and Kyurem-B. An Adamant nature can be used for more power and if the aforementioned Pokemon are not particularly threatening to Mega Medicham's teammates. An Adamant nature also allows Mega Medicham to usually OHKO defensive Landorus-T after Stealth Rock damage with Ice Punch as well as 2HKO defensive variants of Tapu Fini with Zen Headbutt. Telepathy is the best ability pre-Mega Evolution because it prevents ability thieves such as Ditto from abusing Pure Power before Medicham Mega Evolves. Although this is a very rare scenario, Medicham will never need to abuse its Pure Power ability before it Mega Evolves. Once it has Mega Evolved, Pure Power doubles Mega Medicham's Attack stat and allows it to properly wallbreak.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Beware of using High Jump Kick when the opponent has a Ghost-type Pokemon, as they are immune to the move, and Mega Medicham will lose 50% of its health if it misses. Similarly, Mega Medicham should watch out for Protect users such as Celesteela and Heatran. Mega Medicham has very poor defensive stats, and as such, should not be switched into attacks, since even powerful resisted attacks will do significant damage. Use Mega Medicham's teammates to generate as much momentum as possible for it. Slow U-turns and Volt Switches as well as aggressive double switches can be very beneficial in order to get Mega Medicham as many free switch ins as possible.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Landorus-T, Tapu Koko, and Rotom-W are excellent partners alongside Mega Medicham, as they generate momentum and provide Mega Medicham with free switch ins to wreak havoc. Entry hazard support from the likes of Greninja, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory also work well with Mega Medicham, as it forces a large number of switches, so entry hazard damage racks up quickly. Pursuit users such as Weavile and Tyranitar can trap opposing Ghost-type Pokemon like Gengar that are immune to Mega Medicham's High Jump Kick, as well as Psychic-types such as Tapu Lele and Latios that resist Mega Medicham's dual STAB. Mega Medicham is an incredible early- and mid-game wallbreaker, so naturally late-game cleaners such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Tapu Koko, and Choice Scarf Kartana make for solid partners, as they appreciate Mega Medicham's ability to break through even the bulkiest of walls. Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele work well alongside Mega Medicham, as they set up Electric and Psychic Terrain respectively, boosting the power of Thunder Punch and Zen Headbutt. When pairing Mega Medicham with Tapu Lele, however, it is important to note that it cannot use Fake Out versus grounded opponents while Psychic Terrain is active.</p> "

  "Crawdaunt": {
    "overview": "<p>Crawdaunt is a niche pick on offensive teams thanks to its extremely powerful Choice Band- and Adaptability-boosted Water- and Dark-type STAB attacks, which hit virtually the entire tier for neutral damage. Useful utility in Knock Off allows Crawdaunt to offer fantastic support to offensive teams by removing items such as Tangrowth's Assault Vest, Tapu Bulu's Leftovers, and Tapu Fini's Leftovers to give teammates an easier chance at sweeping late-game. Unlike Weavile and Tyranitar, Crawdaunt can easily 2HKO Reuniclus after an Acid Armor boost thanks to Adaptability and prevent it from overwhelming offensive teams. Moreover, Aqua Jet is a helpful priority move that allows Crawdaunt to patch up its poor Speed and revenge kill Pokemon like Volcarona and Mega Diancie, which can be hard to switch into for offensive teams. Despite its strong attacks and priority, Crawdaunt's poor Speed stat means that it struggles to excel in a metagame filled with faster offensive threats that can easily revenge kill it like Mega Medicham, Kartana, and Tapu Bulu. Crawdaunt's lackluster defensive typing and mediocre defensive stats also leave it vulnerable to the plethora of strong moves that flood the OU tier.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Superpower can be used in the final slot over Crunch but is vastly inferior, seeing as this set's primary purpose is to remove items with Knock Off, and most Superpower targets like Ferrothorn, Ash-Greninja, and Hydreigon are crippled by Knock Off or forced to Roost. A Swords Dance set can be used but is generally inferior because Crawdaunt is too slow to find an opportunity to boost its Attack without taking a significant amount of damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types like Tangrowth, Tapu Bulu, Serperior, and Kartana can beat Crawdaunt with their Grass-type STAB attacks and resist its Water-type STAB attacks but don't appreciate their items being removed. Tapu Bulu deserves a special mention because it also resists Crawdaunt's Dark-type STAB attacks and has several potential methods of recovering its HP. Although uncommon, Mega Venusaur is the one of the best defensive checks to Crawdaunt, as it only fears Crunch and can OHKO Crawdaunt with Giga Drain to heal any damage taken.</p> <p><strong>Mega Evolutions: Certain Mega Evolutions like Mega Mawile, Mega Scizor, and Mega Gyarados don't take much damage from Knock Off. The first two can proceed to OHKO Crawdaunt with their super effective STAB attacks but can't switch into Crabhammer, while Mega Gyarados resists both of Crawdaunt's STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon: Mega Lopunny, Tapu Koko, and Tapu Lele all outspeed Crawdaunt and easily OHKO it with their super effective STAB attacks but cannot directly switch into it. Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain protects it from Crawdaunt's Aqua Jet, making it one of the best offensive checks to Crawdaunt one-on-one.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Knock Off is an extremely strong and useful STAB attack, removing items from any Pokemon that attempts to switch into it such as Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu. Crabhammer is used over Waterfall due to its higher Base Power, allowing Crawdaunt to wallbreak more effectively and 2HKO Pokemon like Hydreigon and Mega Scizor, which Waterfall fails to do. Aqua Jet is useful priority for revenge killing weakened Pokemon that Crawdaunt can't outspeed, such as Heatran, Volcarona, Mega Diancie, and Landorus-T. Crunch is useful in very specific instances when Crawdaunt wants to hit certain Pokemon without an item harder than it otherwise would with Knock Off and doesn't want to risk missing with Crabhammer; some examples include Mega Scizor, Mega Charizard X, and Tangrowth.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>When paired with Adaptability, a Choice Band transforms Crawdaunt into a scary wallbreaker that is very hard to switch into thanks to its great Water- and Dark-type STAB coverage. A Jolly nature could be used to outspeed uninvested Landorus-T, but Landorus-T often runs significant Speed investment, so an Adamant nature is preferred to maximize Crawdaunt's wallbreaking potential.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to bring in Crawdaunt through VoltTurn support or predicted doubles, as even resisted hits like Heatran's Magma Storm and Ash-Greninja's Dark Pulse will deal a respectable amount of damage. One of Crawdaunt's selling points is being able to remove items with its Adaptability-boosted Knock Off, so don't hesitate to use it if the opponent depends on Pokemon like Tapu Bulu or Tangrowth as their Water-type answer. If the opponent has a bulky Fairy-type that doesn't mind tanking a Knock Off and can recover easily, such as Clefable or Pain Split Magearna, try to catch these Pokemon on the switch with Crabhammer. Tapu Bulu resists both of Crawdaunt's STAB attacks and can recover HP via Grassy Terrain and Synthesis, so try to cripple it with Knock Off to potentially remove its Leftovers and then switch out to a Pokemon that can threaten it out. Aqua Jet's low Base Power means that it's rather easy to switch into, and as such, it should generally only be used for chip damage when Crawdaunt is at low HP and up against a foe that can KO Crawdaunt or against faster foes that Crawdaunt can revenge kill, such as Volcarona, weakened Mega Alakazam, and Mega Diancie.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Crawdaunt feels right at home on offensive teams with VoltTurn support because it finds few opportunities to come in freely due to its mediocre bulk. Teammates that can usually bring in Crawdaunt safely include Assault Vest Magearna, Landorus-T, and Tornadus-T. Assault Vest Magearna in particular is a wonderful teammate thanks to its ability to switch into Tapu Lele and bring in Crawdaunt with a slow Volt Switch. Tornadus-T is also a fantastic teammate for its ability to switch into Grass-types that can beat Crawdaunt, such as Tapu Bulu, Tangrowth, and Kartana, and bring Crawdaunt into play with U-turn on forced switches. It's useful to have fast offensive Pokemon on the team to patch up Crawdaunt's poor Speed for a wallbreaker. Mega Lopunny is one of the fastest Pokemon in the tier and possesses excellent offensive synergy with Crawdaunt, while Tapu Koko appreciates Crawdaunt's Knock Off support, can threaten bulky Water-types for Crawdaunt, and can bring it in via U-turn against the Ground-types that Tapu Koko draws in. Certain late-game sweepers that appreciate Crawdaunt's ability to remove items from bulky Pokemon make for very good offensive partners. For example, Mega Alakazam and Ash-Greninja have an easier time sweeping once Landorus-T's Choice Scarf or Tangrowth's Assault Vest is removed. Rocky Helmet Garchomp can cripple Grass-types like Kartana and Tapu Bulu, and Heatran can use Toxic or Magma Storm to wear down Pokemon like Greninja and Tapu Fini.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Mega Latias is a metagame staple thanks to its bulk, movepool, and defensive profile. It can come in on common Pokemon like Heatran, Kartana, Rotom-W, Landorus-T, Zapdos, Rockium Z Garchomp, Mega Lopunny, and Battle Bond Greninja using Water-type moves consistently throughout a game. Mega Latias also outspeeds many of these Pokemon, notably Kartana, forcing them out with attacks like Ice Beam, Hidden Power, and Psychic. It's also one of the few Pokemon that can take any one move from Mega Medicham and threaten it back, giving faster-paced teams a decent answer to a Pokemon that usually requires a more passive switch-in. It's also the easiest answer to Swords Dance Gliscor to fit on teams. Mega Latias also has other options like Thunder Wave, Defog, and Calm Mind; its devastating Calm Mind set can outlast many offensive teams and threaten common balance and stall staples, including Toxapex, a common Haze user. However, Mega Latias struggles with four-moveslot syndrome. If its standard set drops Hidden Power Ground or Fighting, then Heatran, Excadrill, and Tyranitar can switch into it without much fear, while the same is true for Toxapex if it drops Psychic. It has some nasty weaknesses to Fairy, Ice, and Dark, being forced out by strong attackers like Tapu Lele and Mega Latios and Pursuit trapped by Tyranitar and Weavile. Mega Latias is vulnerable to poison and paralysis from Pokemon like Heatran, Toxapex, defensive Kommo-o, Zapdos, and Defog Gliscor, which can make it more difficult to check these Pokemon in the long run. It also struggles to break through threats like Magearna and Jirachi regardless of its set, and bulky foes like Clefable and Reuniclus sufficiently wall the utility set.</p> ",

Hidden Power Ground threatens Heatran and Magnezone while also hitting Mega Mawile, offensive Magearna, Excadrill, and Tyranitar for decent damage. Psychic OHKOes Fighting-types like Mega Lopunny, Hawlucha, and offensive Kommo-o after Stealth Rock and threatens Toxapex and neutral targets like Mega Medicham. Hidden Power Fighting OHKOes Kartana and Weavile, heavily damages Tyranitar, and deals decent damage to Steel-types like Excadrill, Ferrothorn, and Heatran. Thunder Wave cripples offensive Pokemon like Mega Alakazam, Tapu Lele, Kyurem-B, Greninja, Magearna, and Volcarona while making defensive staples like Magearna, Reuniclus, Clefable, and Toxapex easier to pressure for teammates. Mega Latias is also a good Defogger due to its great natural bulk and good matchup against common Stealth Rock users like Garchomp, Heatran lacking Toxic, and Landorus-T. However, it should avoid using Defog against status users and Ferrothorn. Thunder Wave and Defog can be used together, but this leaves Mega Latias unable to threaten Stealth Rock setters that can tank Ice Beam, like Heatran packing Toxic and Mega Tyranitar.</p> <p>Hidden Power Fire threatens Kartana, offensive Magearna, Mega Mawile, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor. However, Hidden Power Ground and Fighting have a wider range of targets while still hitting most of these Pokemon adequately. Thunder gives Mega Latias excellent neutral coverage in tandem with Ice Beam while hitting Water- and Flying-types like Manaphy, Greninja, Tornadus-T, Celesteela, and Tapu Fini hard, but it lets most Steel-types check Mega Latias and is weaker than Psychic on neutral targets. Earthquake can be used over Hidden Power Ground; it 2HKOes Heatran and hits Magearna, Mega Diancie, Excadrill, and Tyranitar harder, but Grassy Terrain and burn weaken it significantly, the latter being common from Pokemon like Toxapex, Lava Plume Heatran, and Rotom-W. Surf hits Heatran, Excadrill, and Mega Diancie harder than Hidden Power Fighting or Ground while also doing decent damage to Volcarona, but other coverage moves overshadow it, and it leaves Mega Latias at the mercy of most Steel-types.</p> <p>Keep Mega Latias healthy whenever possible so it can check threats consistently throughout the game. Scout for status moves from Pokemon it would normally pivot into, mainly Heatran and Gliscor. Use Thunder Wave or Defog, as needed, when Mega Latias forces out a foe.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Latias fits well on bulky offense and balance teams. Spikers like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Greninja make excellent partners to chip down foes, since Mega Latias can force a lot of switches; Tyranitar and Heatran are notable targets, as they can pivot around Mega Latias depending on its coverage moves. Ferrothorn checks Fairy- and Dark-types like Tapu Lele, Magearna, Tapu Fini, Weavile, Tyranitar, and Ash-Greninja and further solidifies the rain matchup, while Mega Latias can check Kartana, Heatran, and Ground-types. Skarmory is a secondary answer to Ground-types and a better answer to physical attackers like Mega Lopunny and Tyranitar. Greninja is a fast Spikes setter that threatens offensive teams and benefits from Mega Latias coming in on Grass-types. Heatran is able to set up Stealth Rock, check Fairy-types and Tornadus-T, counter Volcarona and Steel-types, spread Toxic for more residual damage, and trap potential checks with Magma Storm, while Mega Latias can check Ground-types and Water-types like Rotom-W and Manaphy. Toxapex can check Fairy- and Dark-types while also spreading poison and burn with Toxic, Scald, and Toxic Spikes to gradually damage Pursuit users, while Mega Latias covers Ground- and Electric-types and Mega Alakazam lacking Calm Mind. Other Water-types, like Rotom-W and Tapu Fini, check Heatran should Mega Latias lack appropriate coverage, and Mega Latias answers Grass-types in return. Also, Rotom-W can pivot Mega Latias in and Tapu Fini can check Dark-types. Fairy-types like Clefable and Magearna pivot into Dark-type moves for Mega Latias; the former can set up Stealth Rock, while the latter can neutralize bulky setup sweepers with Heart Swap. Meanwhile, Mega Latias can check Heatran, Kartana, and Gliscor. Gliscor and defensive Landorus-T pressure Steel-types and Toxapex, with Gliscor able to absorb status moves and sweep with Swords Dance, while Landorus-T can set up Stealth Rock. Mega Latias benefits both by checking Water- and Grass-types. Magnezone can trap Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Mega Mawile, Kartana, Mega Scizor, and Magearna that wall Mega Latias without Hidden Power Ground or Fighting. Defensive Kommo-o can set up Stealth Rock and check Heatran, Ash-Greninja, Tyranitar, and Hoopa-U.</p> "

Psyshock is much stronger out of the gate, which makes it much more difficult for Haze Toxapex and opposing Calm Mind users like Magearna and Magic Guard Clefable to stop Mega Latias's sweep. It also lets Mega Latias immediately threaten Pokemon like Mega Lopunny, Mega Charizard Y, Mega Medicham, and Kommo-o. Ice Beam hits Dark- and Steel-types like Excadrill, Greninja, and Ferrothorn and directly threatens prominent Pokemon like Gliscor, Landorus-T, Garchomp, Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and opposing Mega Latias. Thunderbolt can be used over Stored Power or Psyshock to threaten Water-types like Toxapex, Greninja, and Tapu Fini and provide good neutral coverage with Ice Beam. Substitute can be used over Ice Beam to punish switches, evade status from Pokemon like Toxapex and Heatran, and use passive checks like Leech Seed Ferrothorn and defensive Clefable as setup fodder. However, it leaves Mega Latias completely walled by Dark-types and unable to check Pokemon such as Gliscor, Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Kartana.

Psyshock sets can be used for quicker damage, while Stored Power sets generally needs to find opportunities to set up multiple Calm Minds in a row.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set enjoys entry hazard support from Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Heatran, and Greninja to KO its checks with fewer boosts. Ferrothorn checks Fairy- and Dark-types like Tapu Lele, Magearna, Tapu Fini, Weavile, Tyranitar, and Ash-Greninja; Skarmory is a secondary answer to Ground-types and a better answer to physical attackers so Mega Latias doesn't get overwhelmed; Heatran checks Fairy-types and Steel-types while crippling checks like Tyranitar and Greninja with Toxic, and it traps and takes out Toxapex with Magma Storm so Mega Latias can more freely run Stored Power. Toxapex spreads residual damage with Toxic and Toxic Spikes and checks Pokemon that give this set a hard time, like Magearna, Jirachi, Weavile, and Tyranitar. Toxic Spikes Toxapex is also an essential partner for single-attack Mega Latias, since it cripples the Dark-types that would stone wall Stored Power or Psyshock. Mega Latias in turn can answer threatening Ground-types for Toxapex. Ground-types like Gliscor and Landorus-T can take out Steel-types and pressure Toxapex, since the Stored Power set can struggle to take them out early-game. Gliscor can pivot into status moves and be a potential secondary wincon with Swords Dance alongside Mega Latias, while Landorus-T can run Stealth Rock, pivot Mega Latias in on desirable setup targets with U-turn, or take out a bulky target with a Z-Move so Mega Latias can sweep more easily. Wallbreakers like the aforementioned Z-Move Landorus-T, Choice Specs Tapu Lele, and Swords Dance or Choice Band Kartana can threaten bulky targets and appreciate the defensive utility Mega Latias provides. Both Clefable and Magearna can pivot into Dark-type moves; Clefable is able to set up Stealth Rock and cripple Toxapex and Heatran with Knock Off, while Magearna can neutralize opposing setup sweepers with Heart Swap and get Mega Latias in safely against Tapu Fini and Clefable with Volt Switch. Defensive Kommo-o can set up Stealth Rock and check Heatran, Ash-Greninja, Tyranitar, and Hoopa-U.</p> <h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Wish could be used on the utility set alongside Roost to heal teammates. However, Roost's 16 PP suffices for most games, and its teammates will usually already have reliable recovery. Reflect Type can also be used on the utility set to evade Pursuit or Toxic from Heatran and Toxapex; however, it's very niche and Mega Latias can run coverage moves to hit these Pokemon. Roar can rack up entry hazard damage and stop setup sweepers, but it's situational and Thunder Wave usually suffices in this regard. Toxic cripples Pokemon like Tyranitar, Greninja, Rotom-W, and Tapu Lele; however, it makes Mega Latias worse against Steel-types. Although Choice Scarf Latias is a fast revenge killer that can provide Healing Wish, it is not strong, lacks the defensive utility that Mega Latias offers, and is overshadowed by other Choice Scarf users like Kartana, Rotom-W, Greninja, and Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey doesn't take much damage from anything Mega Latias can throw at it, and it stays healthy with Soft-Boiled and Natural Cure while crippling Mega Latias with Toxic or Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon</strong>: Pokemon like Mega Alakazam, Z-Move Tornadus-T, Choice Scarf Kartana, Choice Scarf Blacephalon, and Greninja can outspeed and threaten Mega Latias with super effective coverage. However, they're crippled by Thunder Wave, (add comma) and Mega Latias can often take at least one hit from them.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Pursuit users like Tyranitar and Weavile can trap and remove Mega Latias, stopping the Calm Mind set particularly easily. However, they should be careful to not switch into Hidden Power Fighting or Thunder Wave against the utility set, and Reflect Type can play around them. Ash-Greninja outspeeds Mega Latias, which makes it better at stopping the Calm Mind set from getting out hand. However, it must avoid Hidden Power Fighting, Thunder, and Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Ferrothorn, Jirachi, Magearna, Mega Scizor, and Heatran can switch into Mega Latias easily and set entry hazards on it, pivot with U-turn or Volt Switch, set up, and cripple it with status. However, most of these answers are susceptible to repeated damage due to lacking reliable recovery, super effective coverage moves, the Calm Mind set, and being trapped by Magnezone.</p> <p><strong>Status: Poison severely cuts into Mega Latias's longevity, and it can come from Pokemon it should be able to switch into, like Heatran, Kommo-o, and Toxapex. Paralysis is also threatening, especially if Mega Latias can't stay healthy due to full paralysis on Roost turns.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Mega Diancie, Mega Mawile, Magearna, Tapu Fini, and Clefable are all able to take Mega Latias's attacks, threaten it with their super effective STAB moves, and take advantage of it to get up Stealth Rock or set up. However, they can be hindered by Thunder Wave, and Assault Vest Magearna and Tapu Fini are setup fodder for the Calm Mind set.</p> "

  "Latios": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Latios's great Speed tier and offensive stats make it a premier check to several threats in the OU metagame such as Heatran, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. Moreover, its excellent offensive typing, high-powered STAB attacks, and vast range of coverage options make Latios a formidable offensive threat in its own right, able to threaten defensive staples like Toxapex, Gliscor, Mega Venusaur, and Zapdos. Mega Latios also sports numerous type resistances, great bulk, and access to recovery, enabling it to act as a solid pivot into Water-, Grass-, Electric-, and Fire-type attacks. Additionally, Mega Latios's naturally high Attack and access to Earthquake allows it to 2HKO common Psychic-type checks such as Heatran, Assault Vest Magearna, and Tyranitar after Stealth Rock and Spikes damage. Despite its strengths, though, Mega Latios is threatened by common Fairy-types in the tier such as Tapu Lele, Mega Mawile, and Magearna and walled by Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor. Mega Latios is also troubled by faster offensive threats such as Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Mega Alakazam and is highly vulnerable to Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar and Weavile.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Fire is a potential coverage move to hit Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor for huge damage, though other options are typically preferred.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey takes very little from anything Mega Latios carries and can cripple it with Toxic or Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types are a tremendous threat to Mega Latios, as they are immune to Draco Meteor and can threaten Latios with their STAB attacks. Tapu Lele can take any hit from Latios and OHKOes it with Moonblast. Calm Clefable can switch into Latios as it avoids the 2HKO from Psychic and easily outheal the damage with Soft-Boiled and Leftovers. Neither Magearna nor Mega Mawile appreciate an Earthquake, but if needed they can tank one and retaliate.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Dark-types like Tyranitar and Weavile can cut Mega Latios's run short with Pursuit. Ash-Greninja can take any hit aside from Draco Meteor and Thunderbolt and OHKO Latios in return, and Hoopa-U has enough special bulk to tank Draco Meteor and KO with Dark Pulse or Hyperspace Fury.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types That Aren't Weak To Earthquake: Steel-types that aren't weak to Earthquake like Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Celesteela can quite easily switch in on Mega Latios, only fearing the rare Hidden Power Fire or Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Offensive Pokemon faster than Mega Latios can revenge kill it. Both Protean and Battle Bond variants of Greninja outspeed Latios and easily KO it. Tapu Koko is immune to Draco Meteor and can OHKO Latios with Choice Specs Dazzling Gleam. Weavile can OHKO Latios with Icicle Crash and trap it with Pursuit. Flyinium Z Tornadus-T can deal heavy damage to Latios as well. Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T and Tapu Lele can also revenge kill Mega Latios.</p> ",

        "name": "Mega Mixed Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Psychic is Latios's most consistent STAB move, nailing Fairy-types such as Clefable and Tapu Bulu as well as Poison-types such as Toxapex. Earthquake deals with Pokemon that normally switch into Psychic-types, OHKOing Heatran and 2HKOing Assault Vest Magearna and Tyranitar if they have taken even minimal damage. Ice Beam allows Mega Latios to OHKO the likes of Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp, which can be threatening to balance teams Mega Latios usually finds itself in. Draco Meteor is Mega Latios's strongest STAB move and can be used to deal significant damage to neutral targets, even OHKOing offensive Pokemon such as Greninja and Landorus-T. Thunderbolt allows Mega Latios to OHKO Ash-Greninja and deal huge damage to Celesteela and Tapu Fini. Roost increases Mega Latios's longevity, allowing it to switch into offensive threats such as Gliscor and Heatran more reliably. Roost also allows Mega Latios to beat many defensive Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Mew, and Zapdos one-on-one.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Naive nature allows Mega Latios to outspeed key threats such as Kartana and Garchomp while not compromising the power of Earthquake. A Naive nature is chosen over Hasty to make Mega Latios less liable to being revenge killed by priority users. However, you can elect to give Mega Latios a Hasty nature if your team heavily relies on Mega Latios to check specific special attackers like Heatran; although, this leaves Mega Latios more liable to Pursuit trapping.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Using Mega Latios is fairly straightforward. Mega Latios should stick to using the appropriate STAB move in most scenarios in order to deal as much damage as possible. However, if running it, beware of Draco Meteor's side effect, which prevents Mega Latios from spamming it. Latios should Mega evolve and use Earthquake on Magearna upon switching because it cannot be 2HKOed otherwise if the opportunity presents itself. Draco Meteor + Earthquake has a very large chance to KO Choice Band Tyranitar; however, Earthquake should still be used upon switching if possible because bulkier variants have a larger possibility to survive the combination. Mega Latios should preferably be brought in with VoltTurn support or double switches in spite of its respectable bulk in order to maximize its longevity and leave it out of range of being revenge killed by priority and faster Pokemon, but it can still be switched into Pokemon that it checks well, most commonly Heatran or Tapu Bulu.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Magnezone is a very useful partner for Mega Latios because it removes all of the bulky Steel-types that are neutral or immune to Earthquake, such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela, making it significantly easier for Mega Latios to wallbreak. Due to Mega Latios's potency as a wallbreaker, win conditions such as Ash-Greninja, Volcarona, and Choice Scarf Kartana benefit from Mega Latios's ability to punch holes in teams. Additionally, offensive Pokemon that appreciate Heatran and Magearna being KOed by Mega Latios, such as Shift Gear Magearna, make excellent teammates. Pokemon that lay entry hazards such as Landorus-T, Greninja, and Ferrothorn make excellent teammates because their support helps wear down checks to Mega Latios such as Assault Vest Magearna, Ferrothorn, and Mega Tyranitar. Ferrothorn in particular is a useful teammate because it checks key offensive Pokemon that force out Mega Latios such as Double Dance Magearna, Choice Specs Tapu Koko, and Choice Specs Ash-Greninja.</p> "

  "Jirachi": {
    "overview": "<p>Jirachi's above average bulk and great defensive typing give it a place in OU as one of the metagame's most consistent and reliable checks to Magearna, Tapu Lele, and Mega Alakazam while still packing plenty of Speed with Choice Scarf sets. Healing Wish is also an extremely valuable tool for bulky offense archetypes, giving the likes of Mega Charizard X and Volcarona a second shot a sweeping. Jirachi is no slouch offensively either, as courtesy of Serene Grace and Choice Scarf, Iron Head can pose a threat to several weakened or unprepared teams. Defensive sets can also be good picks on a handful of teams, notably providing Wish support and a near impenetrable counter to Tapu Lele, Mega Alakazam, and Magearna. Unfortunately, despite Jirachi's good typing, it is vulnerable to the tier's ever-present Ground-types in Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor and Fire-types like Heatran and Volcarona, as well as having a fearful weakness to Knock Off. Choice Scarf Jirachi can also struggle at times due to its rather average Speed and power and being pressured to U-turn not to lose momentum, which the opponent can and will take advantage of, whereas defensive sets also lose plenty of momentum naturally.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Z-Happy Hour is a potent set for Jirachi, as it can boost all of its sets by one stage and use its expansive mixed attacking movepool to attempt sweeping late-game. Unfortunately, Jirachi will require quite a bit of support in order to sweep with this set, may struggle to find setup opportunities, and will still lack in power after the boosts.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Heatran</strong>: Jirachi lacks a move capable of hitting Heatran for sufficient damage even after a boost, while in return, Heatran can threaten Jirachi with super effective STAB attacks and set up Stealth Rock. It should fear paralysis, however.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Jirachi's general lack of power often keeps it from hitting bulky Water-types like Toxapex, Slowbro, Mantine, and Rotom-W for good damage. Scald burns also heavily threaten Jirachi.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Bulky Ground-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Mega Swampert, and Quagsire pose quite the big threat to Jirachi, as all can tank a hit and in return threaten Jirachi with powerful super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Greninja, Bisharp, and Weavile are all capable of forcing Jirachi out with their super effective STAB attacks and Pursuit trapping it in the latter two's case. Weavile, however, must look out for Iron Head.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Alongside Heatran, the likes of Volcarona, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Charizard X can tank an Iron Head or two and heavily pressure Jirachi with their super effective STAB attacks. All must be wary of paralysis from Body Slam, however.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Jirachi doesn't take too kindly to having burn negate its Leftovers, and it also doesn't appreciate having a decent amount of HP cut from entry hazards if it's constantly switching in and out with U-turn. Rocky Helmet, Iron Barbs, and Rough Skin are all particularly threatening, as these items and abilities discourage Jirachi from attacking.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>U-turn allows Jirachi to keep up momentum and safely pivot out of unfavorable matchups against the likes of Heatran, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, while also being the best option against foes that are weak to it such as Mega Alakazam and Ash-Greninja. It also lets teammates safely come onto the field when Jirachi forces a switch. Healing Wish is a useful support move that completely heals one of Jirachi's offensive teammates, giving them a second chance to set up and sweep. It can also be used to heal a teammate that’s needed to check an offensive threat. Fire Punch lets Jirachi deal super effective damage to Steel-types that would otherwise completely wall it such as Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Trick is an option that allows Jirachi to cripple common defensive switch-ins such as Toxapex and Celesteela, which improves its matchup against balance teams; however, Fire Punch is usually preferred. Ice Punch can be used to hit Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor that give Jirachi trouble.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Scarf lets Jirachi outspeed a number of naturally fast Pokemon such as Mega Alakazam, Greninja, and Tapu Koko, as well as opposing Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T and Tapu Lele.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Jirachi should be switched into predicted resisted attacks such as Psychic from Mega Alakazam and Tapu Lele and Moonblast from Mega Diancie. However, be wary of coverage moves such as Mega Alakazam's Shadow Ball, Choice Specs Tapu Lele's Hidden Power Fire, and Mega Diancie's Earth Power, as they leave Jirachi severely weakened and unable to switch in afterwards. Jirachi can use U-turn as it forces these Pokemon out to gain momentum; however, there are some late-game situations where it's better to spam Iron Head or weaken a predicted switch-in with a coverage move. Healing Wish should be used when Jirachi's boosted Speed is no longer needed and a weakened teammate can attempt to set up and sweep once fully healed. It should also be used to heal a teammate that's necessary in checking an offensive threat. Fire Punch should only be used against Steel-types if necessary, as this move is otherwise weak and can lose momentum by letting in threatening foes such as Ash-Greninja, Heatran, and Garchomp. For these reasons, it's often preferred to pivot with U-turn into a wallbreaker that fares better against Steel-types. Trick should be used to cripple defensive switch-ins by hindering their ability to check other offensive threats, but it should only be used once Jirachi's increased Speed is no longer needed. Using Healing Wish immediately after Trick can be a smart way to bring a teammate in safely.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Thanks to its natural bulk and good defensive typing, as well as its ability to gain momentum, Jirachi is very useful to offensively oriented teams. Wallbreakers that can be brought in through U-turn such as Ash-Greninja, Garchomp, and Mega Mawile make good teammates. The former two can also deal with Heatran, the most common Jirachi counter. Likewise, Pokemon that can also use U-turn or Volt Switch such as Tornadus-T, Tapu Koko, and Rotom-W complete a VoltTurn core with Jirachi. Pokemon that can punch holes early-game and then proceed to sweep late-game such as Mega Mawile, Mega Heracross, and Mega Charizard X all appreciate Jirachi's Healing Wish support. The latter two can also take advantage of bulky Steel-types that switch into Jirachi. Tangrowth forms a solid core with Jirachi, switching into Ash-Greninja and Garchomp for it, while Jirachi is able to take on strong special attackers such as Tapu Lele and Magearna as well as mixed attackers such as Kyurem-B that give Tangrowth trouble. Jirachi is walled by bulky Water- and Ground-types, so Pokemon that can take advantage of them such as Serperior, Tapu Bulu, and Kyurem-B also make good teammates.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Wish",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Wish allows Jirachi to heal both itself and teammates, allowing it to check Pokemon like Tapu Lele, Magearna, Clefable, Tapu Bulu, and Kyurem-B repeatedly throughout the match while functioning as potent utility for the rest of its team. This move has good defensive synergy with Protect, which lets Jirachi stall for Leftovers recovery and heal itself safely with Wish. It is also helpful for playing mind games with Mega Medicham and Hawlucha, which risk crashing and taking 50% recoil if they attack into it with High Jump Kick. Iron Head sports a 60% flinch rate after the boost from Serene Grace and a solid Base Power after the STAB boost, allowing Jirachi to pose a threat to the aforementioned Pokemon that it checks and meaning Tyranitar isn't able to Pursuit trap it with a modicum of consistency. U-turn allows Jirachi to both escape Magnezone's attempts to trap it and grab momentum versus Pokemon that it force out, benefiting from Jirachi's minimally invested Speed stat to help teammates switch in safely when the opposing player opts to not switch out. This move works well alongside Wish to help heal up weakened partners like Heatran when they aren't healthy enough to switch in safely. Body Slam has excellent synergy with Iron Head, having a 60% paralysis rate due to Serene Grace, allowing Jirachi to cripple common switch-ins like Heatran, Kartana, and Landorus-T, pressuring Volcarona, Garchomp, and Hawlucha that try to set up on Jirachi, and reducing the action rate of anything that is slower after the Speed drop to 30% on the turns when Jirachi uses Iron Head. This has particular utility on more defensively inclined teams that aren’t as reliant on momentum as well as on teams that aim to take advantage of paralysis with Pokemon like Mega Heracross.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The listed EVs along with a Careful nature optimize Jirachi's special bulk, helping it check Pokemon like Kyurem-B, Magearna, and Tapu Lele as consistently as possible and allow Jirachi to move before Timid Magearna as well as Modest Heatran. Leftovers is the item of choice, helping Jirachi check a number of Pokemon more consistently by restoring a little HP every turn. Serene Grace increases the rates of Iron Head and Body Slam's secondary effects.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Wish regularly to ensure Jirachi is as healthy as is reasonably possible to ensure that it can repeatedly check Pokemon like Kyurem-B consistently throughout the match. If Jirachi carries Body Slam, it is usually better to use that early-game instead of Iron Head in order to cripple common switch-ins like Heatran and Landorus-T; this is because Iron Head's targets, such as Tapu Lele and Kyurem-B, typically switch out of Jirachi and attempt to take advantage of its passivity. The same applies if Jirachi carries U-turn, except that it is used more to grab momentum rather than to punish the opponent's attempt to create an unfavorable scenario for the Jirachi player. While it is usually advised to use Protect when healing Jirachi with its own Wish, be mindful that always using Protect when healing with Wish can be easily punished by your opponent, who can use it to set up entry hazards, boost their Pokemon's stats, or generate a free switch into a weakened Pokemon that can't otherwise get onto the field safely; thus, it is important to try and mix this up if you can by either attacking or doubling on an expected switch or by taking advantage of paraflinching to generate free turns. Speaking of Protect, don't be afraid to use it if it is unlikely that Jirachi will survive the next hit without recovery from Leftovers or Grassy Terrain, but once again make sure to always weigh up the risks of using it when you are in a poor position, as it can create free opportunities for a wary opponent just as much as it can save Jirachi's skin; don't forget that it has a wide range of utilities beyond Wish and turn-by-turn recovery, notably including stalling for poison damage and scouting for both coverage and Z-Moves.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Jirachi fits best onto balanced and stall teams, which need Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Kyurem-B kept in check. Reasonably bulky Pokemon that lack recovery or are otherwise easily worn down, such as Heatran, Landorus-T, Kyurem-B, and Tapu Fini hugely appreciate Wish support on more balanced builds. Similarly, slow Pokemon that depend on being healthy to switch into something, take a second attack, and heal up, such as Chansey, Clefable, Quagsire, and Mega Sableye, make for excellent partners, as Jirachi can help take pressure off of them to recover off their own damage. Users of Magic Bounce or Defog are useful to reduce the pressure Spikes places onto Jirachi to use Wish repeatedly, making Mega Sableye, Zapdos, and Gliscor excellent partners. Pokemon that appreciate Pokemon like Heatran and Choice Scarf Landorus-T being lured out and paralyzed, including Tapu Bulu, Calm Mind Clefable, Tapu Koko, and Mega Heracross greatly appreciate the utility that Body Slam Jirachi brings to the table. Pokemon that can switch into Fire- or Ground-type moves, such as Toxapex, Alomomola, Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Tyranitar, help relieve the pressure that said attacks put onto Jirachi. Similarly, responses to Ash-Greninja, Gengar, and other Dark- or Ghost-types, such as Weavile, Chansey, Mega Gyarados, Mega Sableye, and the aforementioned Toxapex, are useful partners.</p> "

        "name": "Stealth Rock",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock allows Jirachi to support its team by setting up entry hazards, which it can set up consistently thanks to its good typing and bulk. Iron Head is an extremely useful STAB attack, as it hits Fairy-types super effectively and has a whopping 60% chance to make slower foes flinch. U-turn allows Jirachi to generate momentum as well as pivot out of switch-ins that would otherwise trouble it, such as Landorus-T and Heatran. Healing Wish is an extremely useful support move that allows Jirachi to sacrifice itself in order to fully heal a teammate, which can be useful for helping a teammate sweep late-game. Body Slam and Thunder Wave are both options over Healing Wish, as they can provide Jirachi with a way to support its team in terms of speed control. Wish can be run as an alternative to Healing Wish but isn't preferred due to its inability to heal status or generate momentum as well. Fire Punch is also an option to hit Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Celesteela super effectively, but it also isn't usually preferred due to the greater utility of Jirachi's other attacks.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Near-maximum investment in HP alongside heavy investment in Special Defense gives Jirachi high special bulk, allowing it to check the likes of Tapu Lele, Mega Diancie, and Magearna. The investment in Speed allows Jirachi to most notably outspeed Timid Magearna and Adamant Tapu Bulu to hit them with Iron Head while also outpacing the likes of Modest Heatran and Magnezone, which it can then pivot out of. Leftovers provides Jirachi with valuable passive recovery at the end of each turn and also allows it to negate burn damage if need be. Serene Grace is Jirachi's only possible ability, and provides it with a useful 60% flinch chance on Iron Head.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set's main function is to support teammates that appreciate either Healing Wish or Stealth Rock support. Due to the nature of this set, Jirachi should almost always aim to set up Stealth Rock when sent out. Clefable, Tapu Lele, and Magearna are all good examples of Pokemon Jirachi checks; thus, it should try to switch into and set up Stealth Rock against them. Jirachi's slow U-turn is one of this set's biggest perks, and it can be used to generate momentum on predicted switches into threats that check Jirachi, such as Landorus-T and Alolan Marowak, or when Jirachi wishes to tank a hit and bring in a frailer teammate afterward. Because Healing Wish KOes Jirachi, the move shouldn't be used prematurely and should only be used once Jirachi is low on HP, as using Healing Wish right away would be a bit of a waste of a rather tanky Pokemon. Healing Wish allows a teammate of Jirachi that can sweep late-game, such as Mega Charizard X or Mega Pinsir, punch holes early-game and proceed to clean up later once its health has been restored. Iron Head should mainly be used against threats that take heavy damage from the move that could potentially pose a threat to the rest of Jirachi's team, such as Tyranitar, Tapu Bulu, and Mamoswine.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set is best for primarily offensive teams, as it provides fantastic support in the forms of Healing Wish, entry hazards, and free turns provided by Jirachi's slow U-turn. Powerful setup sweepers that are capable of cleaning up late-game such as Landorus-T, Mega Pinsir, and Volcarona all appreciate the Healing Wish support Jirachi can provide them with, as it allows these threats to punch holes early-game and restore any damage or status ailments inflicted to sweep later on. Powerful wallbreakers such as Greninja, Tapu Lele, Gengar, and Tapu Koko also make good teammates, as they appreciate Jirachi's ability to bring them in safely with its slow U-turn. Jirachi generally has great synergy with Rotom-W, which can form a VoltTurn core with it thanks to its access to Volt Switch as well as check most Fire-, Dark-, and Ground-types. Jirachi baits in Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor, so answers to these such as Ash-Greninja, Tangrowth, and Rotom are required. Jirachi also invites in Ash-Greninja, so it should be paired with Pokemon like Magearna and Tapu Fini to take care of it.</p> "

  "Gastrodon": {
    "overview": "<p>By virtue of Gastrodon's modest defenses, solid defensive typing that leaves it with only one weakness, and access to a reliable recovery move, it finds its niche in OU as an answer to special attackers like Heatran, Tapu Koko, Greninja, Magearna, and Mega Diancie. However, some of these Pokemon such as Heatran and Tapu Koko possess ways of getting around Gastrodon. While it being a Ground-type that isn't weak to Hidden Power Ice is already a great boon, Storm Drain only adds to its defensive qualities, making it a great answer to Water-types in general, as well as to rain sweepers like Kingdra and Ash-Greninja. Gastrodon faces competition from Toxapex, which is another bulky Water-type also capable of checking Ash-Greninja and Kingdra and providing Toxic Spikes or Knock Off support. Furthermore, Toxapex also has better overall bulk and access to Regenerator, which makes it less of a momentum drain than Gastrodon. It also struggles with mediocre bulk, especially physically, which makes it difficult for it to take hits from anything besides the special threats it checks.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Curse can be used to increase Gastrodon's physical bulk and the power of its Earthquake, allowing it to defeat offensive teams; however, it gives up Toxic and it struggles to sweep due to its vulnerability to status. Clear Smog can be used to ruin setup attempts, which is useful due to Gastrodon's passive nature. However, it's useless against Substitute users and Steel-types. Mirror Coat can surprise some special attackers trying to 2HKO Gastrodon by usually OHKOing back. Gastrodon is a good user of this move thanks to its good HP stat, but it is very prediction reliant and situational.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Gastrodon cannot deal much damage to most Grass-types with its STAB moves, and threats such as Kartana, Tapu Bulu, Amoonguss, Tangrowth, Ferrothorn, and Mega Venusaur can easily set up or simply OHKO back with a 4x effective STAB Grass-type attack.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon with Grass-type Coverage: Pokemon that carry Grass-type coverage moves can almost always 2HKO or OHKO Gastrodon. Heatran can run Bloom Doom, which swiftly dispatches Gastrodon. Electric-types like Tapu Koko can sometimes run Grass Knot. Celesteela, which doesn't do much to Gastrodon otherwise, can sometimes carry Giga Drain. Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y use Grass-type moves as their standard coverage and therefore can also defeat Gastrodon easily.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers: Gastrodon's defensive stats aren't the most excellent, especially physically, so powerful attackers such as Tapu Lele and Mega Medicham can break through it.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers: Since Gastrodon is so passive and reliant on Toxic and Scald burns, setup sweepers can easily take advantage of it to set up and break through. Gyarados can freely setup on Gastrodon if it has Substitute as this allows it to avoid Toxic and Scald burns. Quiver Dance sweepers like Volcarona take relatively little after boosting and only fear Toxic. Swords Dance users like Mega Pinsir, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Scizor can set up easily, and Gastrodon needs to get lucky with Scald burns to pose any sort of threat, although it can use Ice Beam or Sludge Bomb to hurt Mega Pinsir and Tapu Bulu.</p> ",

        "name": "Specially Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald deals decent damage and can inflict burns, limiting the effectiveness of physical attacks. Recover is required, as it prevents Gastrodon from being worn down and allows it to wall the Pokemon it switches into. Toxic is necessary for wearing down targets Gastrodon cannot do much else to, such as bulky defensive Pokemon like Zapdos, Tangrowth, and Rotom-W. Earthquake provides Gastrodon with a secondary STAB that is useful for hitting Calm Mind Magearna much harder than Earth Power, as well as Assault Vest variants. Sludge Bomb can be used in the last slot to hit Fairy-types such as Tapu Fini much harder while still handling certain Grass-types that tend to switch in, especially Tapu Bulu; it also has a useful poison chance.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Leftovers increases Gastrodon's longevity, and Storm Drain gives it a useful immunity to Water-type moves. The EV spread maximizes Special Defense, allowing Gastrodon to take on special threats like Heatran, Greninja, Ash-Greninja, Mega Diancie, Blacephalon, and Magearna. A Sassy nature maximizes Special Defense, without decreasing Earthquake's damage output. An EV spread of 248 HP / 44 Def / 216 SpD allows Gastrodon to always survive two Secret Swords from Choice Scarf Keldeo after Stealth Rock damage, meaning Gastrodon can switch in on it safely, although the spread puts Gastrodon at risk of being 2HKOed by Choice Specs Blacephalon's Shadow Ball after Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Using Gastrodon is pretty straightforward, as it basically boils down to using Recover to keep Gastrodon's HP high and using attacks and Toxic on the turns where Recover isn't necessary. Gastrodon can switch into special threats such as Heatran, Tapu Koko, Tornadus-T, and Greninja quite freely and heal off the damage, firing off Scald and Toxic to wear down bulkier foes. It's also a safe answer to common Volt Switch users like Tapu Koko, Magnezone, Zapdos, Rotom-W, and Magearna, and it can easily switch in and block their attempts at gaining momentum or heal off the damage from their main attacks. When using Gastrodon, be wary of Toxic on defensive Pokemon that Gastrodon would otherwise check, such as Heatran. Similarly, scouting for Grass moves can be beneficial, such as Bloom Doom on Heatran.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Gastrodon typically finds itself on balanced, bulkier teams due to its passive nature. Since it's so weak, it needs a teammate that can consistently deal with and wear down Ferrothorn, Tapu Fini, and Tapu Bulu, all of which check it. Fire-types such as Heatran and Mega Charizard X, Flying-types such as Tornadus-T, and Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur are all solid answers to the Grass-types that trouble Gastrodon. Additionally, certain Steel-type Pokemon can form sturdy defensive cores with Gastrodon given their excellent type syngergy: Celesteela and Mega Scizor both resist Grass-type attacks and typically pose an annoyance to the relevant Grass-type Pokemon, save for Hidden Power Fire Mega Venusaur, while Gastrodon can pivot into threatening Fire- and Electric-type Pokemon. Clefable can pass Wishes to Gastrodon and its teammates, which only adds to its longevity, it can also set up Stealth Rock and absorb Toxic for Gastrodon. In return Gastrodon can beat Steel-types that Clefable tends to struggle with. Although Gastrodon is fairly self-sufficient and does resist Stealth Rock, it appreciates entry hazard control to remove Spikes and Toxic Spikes, which can severely hamper its ability to switch in and its general longevity. Tornadus-T and Zapdos can Defog and check certain Grass-types like Ferrothorn.</p> "

  "Lopunny": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Lopunny possesses an amazing Speed stat that lets it outpace most of the unboosted metagame, thus making it an excellent revenge killer. Furthermore, Lopunny's high-Base Power STAB moves give it perfect coverage thanks to its ability Scrappy, which, when backed up by its great Attack stat, let it pose a threat to slower offensive threats that lack the bulk to take its attacks, like Greninja and Tapu Koko. On top of that, Lopunny has access to a wide supportive movepool consisting of moves like Encore and Power-Up Punch that helps it take on bulkier Pokemon it struggles against, such as Clefable and Toxapex. Additionally, STAB Fake Out is another great asset that lets Lopunny pick off weakened Pokemon that outspeed it such as Mega Alakazam. However, Lopunny lacks the immediate power to break through some of the bulkier Pokemon in the metagame such as Mew and Toxapex, which forces it to rely on Power-Up Punch and Encore to pose a threat to defensive teams. Despite Lopunny's good matchup against offense, it can be easily overwhelmed by residual damage from entry hazards, weather conditions, and Rocky Helmet from the likes of Tornadus-T and Tank Chomp, which leaves it vulnerable to priority moves like Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken and Weavile's Ice Shard.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Healing Wish can be used in the last slot to give Lopunny some late-game utility, as it lets Lopunny fully heal a weakened teammate; however, Lopunny is usually really good late-game, so it isn't the best idea to sacrifice it then. Facade lets Lopunny take advantage of non-Psychic Mew and Toxic Spikes from Toxapex to get a really strong STAB move with great coverage. However, this is very situational and being burned can be detrimental because Mega Lopunny's High Jump Kick will do significantly less damage. Toxic is a nice option because it lets Lopunny slowly wear down some of its checks such as Landorus-T and Mew, although the likes of Clefable and Toxapex aren't affected by it, and Lopunny will be badly poisoned as well if it uses Toxic against Mew.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Lopunny lacks the initial power to break through most of the common physically defensive Pokemon in the tier, including the likes of Mew, Toxapex, Skarmory, Mega Slowbro, and Clefable.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Despite Lopunny's impressive Speed stat, it can't outspeed most Choice Scarf users like Keldeo and Landorus-T, which can force it out with Secret Sword and Earthquake, respectively. Mega Alakazam deserves a mention as well because it naturally outspeeds Lopunny and OHKOes it with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Lopunny is prone to getting worn down by entry hazards, weather, and Rocky Helmet damage, which give it a harder time cleaning and revenge killing late-game because of priority users like Ash-Greninja and Weavile. This also means Lopunny is easier to pick off by weaker attacks like defensive Landorus-T's Earthquake and Celesteela's Heavy Slam.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Fake Out lets Lopunny pick off weakened targets that outspeed it like Mega Alakazam and boosted Volcarona. Ice Punch makes it easier for Lopunny to break through defensive Landorus-T, which can chip at it with Rocky Helmet damage or can wall it for a longer period during a game thanks to its Leftovers. It's also great for Gliscor, which can avoid being 2HKOed by Return. Quick Attack can be used instead of Ice Punch and alongside Fake Out for a deadly double-priority combination that can give offensive teams a lot of trouble, though it only makes Lopunny's matchup against balance and stall worse. Power-Up Punch lets Lopunny punish passive switch-ins like Mew and Clefable with Attack boosts to eventually break through them. Encore works well in combination with Power-Up Punch, since it locks passive Pokemon like Mew and Toxapex into their recovery moves, thus giving Mega Lopunny free setup opportunities.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Limber is Lopunny's best ability prior to Mega Evolution because it prevents Lopunny from being paralyzed in a pinch.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Lopunny is a fairly straightforward Pokemon due to its perfect coverage and great offensive stats, which give it a good matchup against offensive teams that lack a bulky Pokemon to take it on. However, in matchups where the opponent does have a reliable answer like Mew, Clefable, or Toxapex, it should be played more precisely. If Lopunny is running Encore alongside Power-Up Punch, it can use a different game plan; instead of catching passive Pokemon on the switch with Power-Up Punch, it should use one of its attacks to weaken the foe and force the opponent to use a recovery move. Then, it can use Encore and lock said check into its recovery move, thus giving Lopunny free room to start boosting its Attack and either force a switch or keep setting up on the recovery-locked foe.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Lopunny works well on offensive teams that are looking for a good matchup against other offensive teams, so teammates that can cover the stall and balance matchups are great alongside it. Wallbreakers like Swords Dance Tapu Bulu and Choice Band Victini are usually big nuisances for balance and stall teams, which Lopunny struggles against. Due to its frailty, Lopunny will also need a solid defensive backbone that can take hits for it and help bring it into the field safely. Pivots like defensive Landorus-T and Assault Vest Magearna work here. Another support option that helps Lopunny against bulkier teams is entry hazard support. Stealth Rock and Spikes setters like Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, Greninja, and Garchomp can lay hazards and slowly wear down switch-ins, although Clefable is immune to them thanks to its Magic Guard ability. Additionally, Toxic Spikes from Toxapex or Greninja can cripple Mew and bulky Water-types like Alomomola and Slowbro, which have a harder time checking Lopunny when poisoned. Because of the prevalence of some of Mega Lopunny's checks such as Toxapex and Mew, teammates that act as lures for these are appreciated. Greninja, for example, can lure them both in and surprise them with Extrasensory and Dark Pulse, respectively. Kyurem-B is another good teammate when holding Icium Z because it can get a surprise KO on Mew while also pressuring Landorus-T. Lastly, Magnezone traps Skarmory and physically defensive Celesteela, two big roadblocks for Lopunny, thus giving Lopunny an easier time late-game.</p> "

  "Garchomp": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its access to Swords Dance, solid coverage moves, and good Speed and Attack stats, Garchomp is a strong wallbreaker capable of threatening the majority of the tier. Its ability to put pressure on most Defoggers such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos by virtue of its Z-Move also makes it a reliable entry hazard setter. In a defensive role, Garchomp is capable of checking numerous threats, such as Heatran, Mega Scizor, and Hawlucha, either dealing with them completely or at least crippling them with the combination of Rough Skin and Rocky Helmet. This set's role compression doesn't stop there, though, as it also can set up Stealth Rock and pressure opposing Defoggers with Toxic while phazing setup sweepers with Roar or Dragon Tail. Mega Garchomp's added bulk and firepower under sand makes it a formidable wallbreaker, hitting anything with its STAB and coverage moves hard while finding many opportunities to set up with Swords Dance. Unfortunately, Garchomp faces competition in its roles. Defensively, Gliscor can be a better choice on some teams, as it can be a better check to non-offensive Heatran, has a reliable recovery move in Roost, and can either set up or remove hazards from the field. Also, Mega Garchomp, while being a powerful wallbreaker, faces huge competition from its normal forme and other Mega Evolutions, since the Speed that Mega Garchomp loses when it Mega Evolves can be troublesome. Upon Mega Evolving, it becomes slower than Tapu Lele and Hydreigon, two Pokemon that can be dealt with its non-Mega Speed stat.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Other Z-Crystals, such as Groundium Z or Firium Z, can also be used in order to OHKO Tapu Fini at +2 with Tectonic Rage or Tangrowth, Celesteela, or Skarmory with Inferno Overdrive from Fire Fang under the same conditions, only needing minimal chip damage. However, both options are very lacking and miss out on numerous Pokemon that Rockium Z enables Garchomp to hit. Dragonium Z in tandem with Outrage is another option for Stealth Rock sets to threaten common switch-ins such as Tangrowth and Landorus-T. However, as Outrage locks Garchomp in, this set can often struggle to reliably keep Stealth Rock up. Endure can be run on TankChomp to rack up damage against physical attackers in general, but it's often hard to fit.</p> <p>As for Mega Garchomp, Dragon Claw alongside Fire Fang is an option on the Swords Dance set that lets Mega Garchomp hit the likes of Tapu Bulu and Celesteela without having to be dependent on sand support, but it's often outperformed by Earthquake and Stone Edge variants as well as mixed variants of Mega Garchomp that use the same coverage in a much more formidable fashion.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ice-type Moves and Pokemon: Common Ice-type moves such as Ice Beam, Hidden Power Ice, and Ice Punch all do insane damage to Garchomp, crippling its ability to break, set up entry hazards, or function as bulky pivot well. Weavile and Mamoswine are formidable examples that utilize Ice-type moves, since both can revenge kill Garchomp with Ice Shard.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Faster Fairy-types such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Mega Diancie can outspeed Garchomp and OHKO it with their STAB moves. Tapu Koko can achieve the same result with Hidden Power Ice or Dazzling Gleam if Garchomp was weakened before the hit. Clefable can endure a +2 Earthquake from a non-Mega Garchomp and has a very good chance to survive a +2 Continental Crush at full health and retaliate with Moonblast. Mega Mawile can OHKO Garchomp with Sucker Punch at +2, provided that Garchomp has been chipped a little beforehand.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon: Greninja, Weavile, Mega Latios, and Mega Latias can all OHKO Garchomp with ease without the risk of being hit by its moves. Grassium Z Kartana can achieve the same result, even without a boost from Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory: Although it drops to a +2 Continental Crush followed by Stone Edge if it switches into any of these moves, Skarmory can OHKO Garchomp with Counter if it endures the boosted Rock-Type Z-Move.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon</strong>: If it lacks a Z-Move, Pokemon like Tangrowth and Slowbro can annoy Garchomp, pivoting into its moves and crippling it and its partners with Sleep Powder or a Scald burn, respectively. Mega Slowbro deserves a special mention, as it survives even a +2 Devastating Drake after Stealth Rock damage and can OHKO Garchomp back with Ice Beam.</p> ",

It also puts pressure on opposing Defoggers with the threat of being OHKOed by its Z-Move. Stone Edge, alongside Rockium Z, gives Garchomp the ability to break through Celesteela and Tapu Bulu with Continental Crush after a Swords Dance boost while keeping the pressure against Defog users such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos after the use of the Z-Crystal. Swords Dance doubles Garchomp's Attack stat, making it possible to break bulky targets much more easily, such as Clefable and Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Rough Skin punishes physical attackers that make contact with Garchomp, chipping away at Pokemon such as Hawlucha, Kartana, and Mega Medicham. Rockium Z allows Garchomp to use its Rock-type Z-Move, helping it break through physically bulky Pokemon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to set up Stealth Rock on a predicted switch, since Garchomp forces a lot of switches and threatens to OHKO most entry hazard removers. Continental Crush should be used after Swords Dance has been set up to break through Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu, Landorus-T, and Celesteela; however, the latter two require some chip damage before they go down to the Z-Move. Even unboosted, Stone Edge still puts a lot of pressure against the likes of Tornadus-T and Zapdos, so it's unnecessary to waste the Z-Move if there are other relevant targets. If needed, Garchomp can be used to check Heatran and Magnezone, but it risks losing its wallbreaking potential with losing HP and a possible status condition.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Greninja or its Ash forme can form a good core with Garchomp, forming a good entry hazard stacking core and chipping away at each other's checks. Wallbreakers such as Mega Mawile appreciate Steel-types and Landorus-T being gone while dealing with Garchomp's checks such as Tapu Bulu and Celesteela. Defensive options can be used to pivot into a variety of foes, such as Ferrothorn for Fairy-types and Zapdos for Mega Lopunny and Kartana. A good entry hazard remover, such as Tornadus-T or Zapdos, is beneficial, since the residual damage from hazards can leave Garchomp in range of attacks, such as +2 Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch, from Pokemon it should otherwise defeat.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Mega Garchomp is a great Stealth Rock user due to the multitude of switches it is able to force against Pokemon such as Heatran, Magearna, and Mega Mawile. Earthquake is used instead of Earth Power because Mega Garchomp's uninvested Attack is greater than its fully invested Special Attack and Earthquake has higher BP. It also does much greater damage to Toxapex, Tapu Fini, and Magearna. Draco Meteor is Mega Garchomp's strongest STAB move and its best tool against Tornadus-T, Landorus-T, Rotom-W, Mega Latios, and Mega Latias. Fire Blast allows it to get past Pokemon that would otherwise shut it down or take advantage of it, such as Celesteela, Tapu Bulu, Ferrothorn, and Mega Mawile in Grassy Terrain.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Rough Skin is Garchomp's best ability before Mega Evolving and can be used to get chip damage on Kartana or Landorus using U-turn. However, it shouldn't be used in a fashion like that liberally, since Mega Garchomp doesn't have recovery and is not bulky like TankChomp. A Mild nature is preferred over Rash in order to get past Tornadus-T, Rotom-W, and Celesteela with more ease while the drop in Defense doesn't matter as much as Special Defense; Mega Garchomp is much more adept at checking special attackers like Heatran and Magnezone. While running a Naive or Hasty nature is viable, it is generally not advised due to the extra power of Mild being very useful against Tornadus-T, Landorus-T, and Rotom-W.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mega Garchomp is best used as an early- to mid-game wallbreaker and Stealth Rock setter. Try to get it in via aggressive double switches or U-turns and take advantage of the switches it forces in order to get Stealth Rock up or use one of its strong attacks on a predicted switch-in, such as Draco Meteor on Rotom-W or Fire Blast on Celesteela. Mega Garchomp can also switch into Fire-types like Heatran and Mega Charizard X lacking a Dragon STAB attack or Electric-types like Zapdos lacking Hidden Power Ice and Magnezone. However, keep in mind that it is susceptible to chip damage and can't do so continuously throughout the game. When weakened it also can't take advantage of its great natural bulk, which allows it to tank powerful moves like Choice Specs Greninja's Hydro Pump, Mega Alakazam's Psychic, and Choice Band Kartana's Leaf Blade. This means that teams that Mega Garchomp finds itself on shouldn't rely on it as the sole counterplay to said Fire- and Electric-type Pokemon. Mega Garchomp can oftentimes hold off on Mega Evolving until it needs the extra power, which gives Pokemon like Mega Latias and Celesteela a false sense of security, allowing you to breeze past them with a surprise Draco Meteor or Fire Blast. Regular Garchomp also has a better Speed tier, rendering it faster than Jolly Excadrill, Modest Tapu Lele, and everything else in their respective Speed tiers.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tornadus-T provides an excellent partner to Mega Garchomp, as it is able to switch into Landorus-T relatively freely (although it should be careful of Stone Edge), can get Mega Garchomp in safely against Heatran and Toxapex through U-turn, and can overwhelm mutual checks like Celesteela and Rotom-W. Ash-Greninja appreciates Mega Garchomp's ability to lure and weaken Grass-types like Ferrothorn and Tapu Bulu, as it has a much easier time breaking through when they are low on health or fainted. It also can draw in Toxapex and Magearna for Mega Garchomp to take advantage of. Magearna is another strong teammate for Mega Garchomp. Offensive variants appreciate the holes Mega Garchomp can punch through bulkier teams in order to clean late-game with Shift Gear, while defensive Volt Switch variants can let it in safely against Heatran and Toxapex. Ferrothorn forms a strong utility core with Mega Garchomp, providing Spikes to accompany Mega Garchomp's Stealth Rock. Leech Seed allows Mega Garchomp to benefit from Heatran trying to take advantage of Ferrothorn, Knock Off can cripple Celesteela and Tangrowth to allow Mega Garchomp to break them with more ease, and Thunder Wave makes Tornadus-T and Kartana slower than Mega Garchomp, thus rendering them exploitable.</p> "

Fire Blast aims to hit Kartana, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor, all of which completely wall this set without it. If crippling the opposing team is more desired, Roar phazes the opposing Pokemon, which include switch-ins to Garchomp such as Tornadus-T and Tangrowth, hard-hitters that want to attack Garchomp such as Kartana and Mega Lopunny, and Substitute setters.

Rough Skin, in tandem with Rocky Helmet, aims to chip a big chunk of damage from U-turn users and physical attackers that make contact with Garchomp.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It's recommended to set up Stealth Rock against foes that Garchomp forces out, such as Heatran and Magnezone, in order to set the entry hazard up without taking damage. Stacking chip damage by using Roar  with Stealth Rock up is useful for putting targets into KO range from Garchomp's teammates, so using these moves is usually a good early-game strategy. Pivoting Garchomp in on predicted weak moves such as Ferrothorn's Power Whip and Mega Lopunny's Fake Out is a good way to chip a good portion of HP from them, and Fire Blast can KO Ferrothorn if it was weakened a bit before. Garchomp can function as a last-ditch effort to stop setup sweepers such as Kartana and Mega Pinsir, as both only threaten to OHKO Garchomp with Leaf Blade or Return, leaving them in range of priority moves such as Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken with the chip damage from Rough Skin + Rocky Helmet. Punishing U-turn users that lack reliable recovery like Landorus-T and Choice Scarf Greninja can be useful in the long run, weakening them for Garchomp's teammates. However, beware of Ice-type coverage from them, since it can weaken or OHKO Garchomp.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Setup sweepers like Magearna find opportunities to set up against Pokemon that scare Garchomp away, such as Greninja and Mega Latias, and can nuke or at least weaken Regenerator pivots in Tornadus-T and Tangrowth. Fairy-type checks such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex can be used to pivot into these moves, with the added benefit of setting up Spikes and Toxic Spikes, which helps Garchomp to rack up damage when combined with Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, and phazing moves.</p> "

Maintaining a Sand Force-boosted Stone Edge is also good to wear down Landorus-T more easily, which is a very frequent Mega Garchomp switch-in.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Since Mega Garchomp's real power is only available under sand, Tyranitar and Hippowdon can support it by activating Sand Force, making Mega Garchomp's Ground-type STAB attacks and Rock coverage even more powerful. Tyranitar can deal with Mega Latios and Mega Latias, whereas Hippowdon can set Stealth Rock, freeing up a moveslot for Substitute on Mega Garchomp. Cleaners such as Excadrill and Ash-Greninja appreciate the havoc wreaked by Mega Garchomp in order to sweep more easily later on. Pivots such as Toxapex and Rotom-W can be used to help Mega Garchomp deal with opposing Greninja and Ice-types, and in return they appreciate Garchomp's ability to deal with Heatran and Tapu Bulu. Rotom-W also provides Mega Garchomp with a slow Volt Switch, allowing it to switch in against a threat without too much worry. Defensive Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Celesteela can be used to endure most moves from Fairy-types, such as Tapu Koko in the former's case and Tapu Lele in the latter's case.</p> "

  "Hippowdon": {
    "overview": "<p>Hippowdon's phenomenal bulk coupled with a solid typing and access to some good support moves in Stealth Rock, Whirlwind, and Slack Off allow it to act as a really good blanket check to some common threats such as Mega Pinsir, Mega Mawile, Mega Charizard X, and Tyranitar. Sand Stream helps when it comes to dealing with rain teams and Mega Charizard Y. Unfortunately, Hippowdon's Ground typing makes it weak to Grass-, Water-, and Ice-type attacks, which are used by very common Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu, Greninja, and Weavile. Hippowdon is also very passive; it's easily shut down by Taunt and can become setup fodder if it doesn't pack Whirlwind.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rock Slide can be used instead of Stone Edge for more accuracy, but it doesn't ensure an OHKO on Mega Pinsir. Rocky Helmet can be used over Leftovers to punish physical attackers, but the passive recovery is generally preferred. A specially defensive spread and a Careful nature can be used to handle special attackers such Heatran, Tapu Koko, Magnezone, Magearna, Gengar, and Mega Charizard Y, but Hippowdon won't be able to check physical threats well, and it's outclassed in this regard by Pokemon such as Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Tapu Bulu.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Special Wallbreakers: While Hippowdon has great physical bulk, its average Special Defense makes it vulnerable against special attackers such as Tapu Lele, Volcarona, Hoopa-U, and Mega Latios.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu, Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Mega Venusaur can wall Hippowdon and force it out, as they tank Earthquake easily and can shrug off its common coverage moves. They can also cripple Hippowdon with a super effective STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Water-types threaten Hippowdon with their super effective STAB attacks. Offensive Pokemon such as both Greninja formes and Keldeo can easily OHKO it but don't like taking a Earthquake, while bulkier Water-types such as Alomomola and Suicune don't fear Earthquake and still threaten Hippowdon.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Attacks: Ice-types such as Kyurem-B, Weavile, and Mamoswine are able to either do considerable damage to Hippowdon or OHKO it with their STAB attacks, although they cannot switch in safely on Earthquake and don't like switching while Stealth Rock is set up.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Hippowdon is easily worn down by status ailments such as burn and poison, as well as entry hazards, especially Toxic Spikes, which prevents it from checking some threats effectively.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock is one of the best options on Hippowdon because of its staying power and ability to switch in on plenty of threats. Earthquake is Hippowdon's most reliable attack, as it offers good power and can hit Tapu Koko, Mega Mawile, and Heatran hard. Slack Off provides reliable recovery for Hippowdon that, combined with its bulk, makes it hard to wear down. Whirlwind phazes foes and prevents Hippowdon from becoming setup fodder, mostly to Hawlucha, and it works well in tandem with Stealth Rock. Stone Edge is an alternative to Whirlwind that hits the common Flying-types that would wall Hippowdon otherwise, such as Zapdos, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Charizard Y. Toxic can be used over Whirlwind to cripple Pokemon that Hippowdon can't touch and wear down opposing defensive Pokemon, such as Landorus-T, Tangrowth, Rotom-W, and Zapdos. Ice Fang is an option to deal with the likes of Garchomp, Dragonite, and Landorus-T, but it comes with the drawback of having to drop either Whirlwind or Stealth Rock, which makes Hippowdon not able to perform as well as it should.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>An EV spread of 252 HP / 112 Def / 144 SpD ensures Hippowdon will avoid getting OHKOed by Tapu Koko's Twinkle Tackle after a Calm Mind, while also dodging a 2HKO from unboosted Tapu Lele's Moonblast, offensive Tornadus-T's Hurricane, and Modest Magnezone's Flash Cannon while having enough physical bulk to tank an Earthquake from +2 Adamant Landorus-T and Return from +2 Mega Pinsir. Leftovers provides Hippowdon with a source of passive recovery, which allows it to avoid being 2HKOed in most of the aforementioned close calls. Run Sand Force if Mega Venusaur or Synthesis Tapu Bulu is one of Hippowdon's teammates, as Synthesis recovers less when sand is present. An EV spread of 252 HP / 240 Def / 16 SpD is an option to handle physical attackers more easily while still being able to check Tapu Koko and Heatran to some extent.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Hippowdon can function as a catch-all check for physical attackers that don't have super effective moves for it, such as Tyranitar, some Mega Mawile, and Mega Charizard X. It can also check a couple of special attackers such as some variants of Tapu Koko and Heatran. Due to its low Speed stat, Hippowdon will often move last, so be sure to keep it healthy with Slack Off to consistently check opposing Pokemon. Hippowdon can set up Stealth Rock many times throughout the match, so it doesn't need to worry about opposing entry hazard removers unless Stealth Rock being set up is necessary to win. Avoid letting Hippowdon be burned or poisoned, as it will interfere with its ability to check threats.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Grounded Poison-types such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Gengar can remove Toxic Spikes for Hippowdon, as well as being able to check Grass-types decently. Teammates that can take on Ice-, Water-, and Grass-types are appreciated. Pokemon such as Toxapex, Celesteela, and Ferrothorn can decently check threats such as Ash-Greninja, Kyurem-B, and Tangrowth, while Toxapex and Ferrothorn can additionally set up Toxic Spikes or Spikes, respectively. Tapu Koko, Tapu Bulu, and Tangrowth can handle almost any Water-type in the tier without trouble. Heatran is an effective lure for Water-types, as it can trap them with Magma Storm and beat them with Bloom Doom. It can also threaten most Grass- and Ice-types with its Fire-type STAB moves. Excadrill is a decent teammate due to Hippowdon activating its ability Sand Rush; Excadrill can also remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin and outspeed Pokemon that threaten Hippowdon such as Tapu Lele, Keldeo, and Kyurem-B with Sand Rush and beat them. Mega Garchomp also benefits from the sand, which boosts its Ground- and Rock-type moves.</p> "

In addition, great STAB moves such as Knock Off, Ice Shard, and Pursuit ensure Weavile will almost never be dead weight in any matchup, as it can provide utility in several ways against several team archetypes. However, Weavile's typing is awful defensively, granting it a Stealth Rock weakness as well as weaknesses to common types like Fairy, Fighting, and Steel. Said typing also means Weavile will set up on by dangerous threats like Mega Mawile, Volcarona, Z-Move Magearna, and Mega Scizor if not used carefully.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choice Scarf set can be used on teams that are very weak to Mega Alakazam as a reliable revenge killer to it, although it's rather lacking in power and has STAB types that are easy to take advantage of. Swords Dance alongside Groundium Z and Dig, Icium Z, or Fightinium Z with Low Kick, can turn Weavile into a niche wallbreaker, as it can lure in threats like Toxapex, Ferrothorn, Magearna, and Heatran depending on the Z-Move selection. However, it faces tough competition from other wallbreakers like Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and Garchomp, which are generally better as wallbreakers and provide far more defensive utility than Weavile.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Mega Scizor, Mega Mawile, and Kartana can easily survive a hit from Weavile and proceed to use Swords Dance. However, Kartana takes a lot of damage from Icicle Crash and dislikes having its item removed by Knock Off. Pain Split Magearna takes very little from Knock Off thanks to Fairium Z and has more longevity than its other sets, making it an extremely consistent counter.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Alakazam can outspeed and OHKO Weavile, but they can't switch into it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Bulky Volcarona takes reduced damage from Knock Off thanks to Buginium Z and can use Weavile as setup fodder if locked into Icicle Crash. Heatran dislikes taking a Knock Off but can always survive one and OHKO back with Lava Plume or Magma Storm. Similarly, Mega Charizard X can survive one hit and proceed to use Dragon Dance or just attack with Flare Blitz.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon: Tapu Fini, Celesteela, and Toxapex don't appreciate getting their items removed by Knock Off but can beat Weavile one on one and can switch into it relatively consistently.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Knock Off packs good power and can remove important items such as Black Sludge from Toxapex, Leftovers from Rotom-W and Heatran, and Assault Vest from Magearna. Ice Shard is important to revenge kill threats like Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Mega Alakazam. Pursuit traps and weakens threats like Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, Mega Latios and Latias, and Chansey, and it can also generally secure KOs against a variety of Pokemon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Choice Band is preferred over Life Orb so that Weavile doesn't get too worn down from recoil and Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Early in the game, Weavile should be spamming Knock Off to weaken potential checks. However, Weavile can be taken advantage of by Mega Mawile and Mega Scizor, so keep this in mind if it runs into this matchup. Weavile has good late-game cleaning potential between its high Speed and Ice Shard, meaning it can sometimes be saved for a late-game sweep. It can also be saved if it needs to revenge kill a setup sweeper such as Mega Pinsir or Rock Polish Landorus-T. Weavile's bulk is terrible and it has few resistances, which means it must usually be brought in via U-turn or Volt Switch support or on an aggressive double switch. Avoid sending Weavile out too much when Stealth Rock is on the field, as it can get easily worn down by residual damage. Weavile can take advantage of Choice-locked threats like Tapu Lele and Greninja locked into Ice Beam or Spikes and proceed to Pursuit trap them, which also means they must play more carefully when Weavile is still active.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Weavile pairs really well with Magearna, Mega Lopunny, and Ash-Greninja, as it can remove Toxapex's Black Sludge. Additionally, it can remove Magearna's Assault Vest, making it easier for them to break through it. Entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, and Greninja can aid Weavile in its wallbreaking job and generally improve its damage output against common switch-ins like Magearna, Toxapex, and Mega Scizor. Weavile is very weak to every entry hazard, so entry hazard removers like Tornadus-T, Landorus-T, and Kartana are nice partners since they can improve Weavile's longevity and also happen to fit nicely on offensive teams. Heatran, Mega Charizard X, and bulky Volcarona are able to pressure common Weavile checks like Choice Scarf Kartana, Mega Mawile, Mega Scizor, and Magearna, which are all capable of taking advantage of Weavile. In particular, Magnezone is able to trap and remove Mega Scizor, which is one of Weavile's hardest counters and, if running Electrium Z, can trap Mega Mawile as well. Weavile is good at Pursuit trapping threats like Mega Latios, Mega Latias, and Tornadus-T, so teammates such as Mega Medicham, Tangrowth, Tapu Bulu, and Keldeo make for good teammates, as these threats being weakened makes it easier for them to do their jobs.</p> "

It can perform as a great wall both physically with its Rocky Helmet set as well as specially with an Assault Vest, which is required for surviving hits from Pokemon like Ash-Greninja. Tangrowth is able to fill these roles well due to Regenerator, allowing it to heal off passive damage while switching, retaining momentum for its teammates while still being able to repeatedly switch into the threats that it needs to check. Despite its general lack of power, Tangrowth has great utility moves such as Knock Off and coverage moves such as Earthquake for Heatran, Hidden Power Ice for Landorus-T and Garchomp, Hidden Power Fire for Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, and Sludge Bomb for Tapu Bulu. However, Tangrowth is relatively passive and relies on its super effective coverage to be a threat, and the Assault Vest set is prone to Knock Off, which means that it has a much harder time switching into the threats that it needs to check if it loses its Assault Vest.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Toxic lets Tangrowth wear down a variety of its checks better on the physically defensive set; this is best paired with Hidden Power Fire to deter Steel-types like Ferrothorn from switching in on Toxic. Focus Blast has good coverage and allows Tangrowth to hit Ferrothorn and Heatran in one slot, but the low accuracy and PP of the move may make this less desirable than its other moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Mega Venusaur: The strongest counter to Tangrowth, Mega Venusaur takes very little damage from all of Tangrowth's coverage options, STAB moves, and Knock Off and in return can take out Tangrowth with a STAB Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Tornadus-T, Hawlucha, and Mega Pinsir have the ability to break past Tangrowth thanks to their super effective STAB moves and do not really fear anything from Tangrowth; Tornadus-T can use Hurricane, Hawlucha can break through Tangrowth with Acrobatics after consuming its item, and Mega Pinsir threatens Tangrowth with Aerilate-boosted Returns.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Heatran resist Tangrowth's Grass-type STAB moves and threaten it with super effective Fire-type STAB moves of their own; Heatran must watch out for Earthquake, and Mega Charizard Y and Volcarona must watch out for Rock Slide, however.</p> ",

Knock Off is Tangrowth's most useful utility move on this set, removing items and weakening foes for its teammates to take advantage of. Hidden Power Ice allows Tangrowth to weaken Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor, which can otherwise set up on Tangrowth. Earthquake hits Heatran and other Steel-types like Magearna and Mega Mawile to weaken them for a partner to take advantage of. Sludge Bomb can be useful to take care of Tapu Bulu and Tapu Koko and can also come in handy against opposing Tangrowth and Tornadus-T; the poison chance can weaken them, and Sludge Bomb can do significant damage if the opposing Tangrowth's own Assault Vest has already been removed with Knock Off. Hidden Power Fire can be used to hit Ferrothorn, which takes the rest of Tangrowth's moves with ease, and it also hits Kartana and Mega Scizor; however, be wary, as Mega Scizor can threaten Tangrowth with U-turn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Sassy nature is used because Tangrowth's Speed is very low, and it is best to boost Tangrowth's Special Defense without harming any of its damage output. 252 HP and 12 Defense EVs allow Tangrowth to survive two Ice Punches from Mega Swampert after Stealth Rock damage, as well as a +1 Breakneck Blitz from Kartana.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It is best to use Tangrowth's great bulk and wide set of resistances by switching it directly into the threats that it checks such as Tapu Koko, Keldeo, Manaphy, and Ash-Greninja; however, be careful when playing around Ash-Greninja, as it can put Tangrowth into a potential 2HKO range with either Ice Beam or Dark Pulse after Stealth Rock damage if Tangrowth is weakened. Thanks to Regenerator, Tangrowth can pivot into threats that can still hurt it and pivot back out to scout out what type of set the foe has. Knock Off in most cases is the safest move to throw out, as it can scout for items and potential Z-Crystals on the opposing team while weakening foes that rely on their items. Tangrowth can use its super effective coverage to weaken foes like Garchomp and Gliscor if it carries Hidden Power Ice and Ferrothorn if it has Hidden Power Fire. In most other cases, using Giga Drain or Knock Off is relatively safe. However, be wary of foes that tend to run Knock Off, such as opposing Tangrowth, as they can severely limit Tangrowth's ability to check the threats that it needs to; for example, an itemless Tangrowth can get 2HKOed by non-transformed Greninja with Choice Specs Dark Pulse after Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set is best on bulky offense and balance teams that require a strong pivotal check to Water-, Grass-, and Electric-type threats. Toxapex can handle the Fire-type threats that Tangrowth has difficulty taking on itself and forms a Regenerator core with Tangrowth. Heatran is a very good partner for Tangrowth, as it is able to set up Stealth Rock to help Tangrowth wear down the opposing team easily. Heatran can also handle Steel- and Grass-types such as Magearna and Mega Venusaur, as they take very little from Tangrowth's coverage options, and it appreciates Tangrowth's ability to check Ground-types like Garchomp for it. Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor also pair well with Tangrowth; they appreciate Tangrowth's ability to check Water-types for them and can even weaken Fire-types like Heatran, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Charizard Y. Entry hazard control is a good idea to run with Tangrowth, as it can get easily worn down by Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes, which, even with Regenerator, can cause trouble for Tangrowth when it switches into the threats that it checks. Zapdos is a good teammate, as it likes Tangrowth's ability to take care of various special attackers for it, and it can check the likes of Mega Pinsir for Tangrowth in return. Tapu Fini is also a good partner due to the great type synergy that it has with Tangrowth, and Tapu Fini can clear entry hazards.</p> "

Due to this set's poor special bulk, switching into special attackers is not advised unless you are sure that Tangrowth can take the hit, such as against Tapu Koko. Sleep Powder should be used on a predicted switch into a threat that you wish to incapacitate; this can also be taken advantage of by predicting the threat that the opponent wishes to use as sleep fodder by using Knock Off or switching into a teammate that can take advantage of the designated sleep fodder.

Facade has solid coverage against most of the metagame's common threats, such as Tornadus-T, Rotom-W, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Latias.

Gliscor's Speed investment can also be customized to outspeed some of these threats.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>244 HP EVs give Gliscor a Poison Heal number, which lets it recover more HP. 20 Speed EVs in tandem with a Jolly nature allow Gliscor to outspeed Modest Heatran. The rest of the EVs are dumped into Special Defense so that Gliscor can take hits from Tornadus-T, Landorus-T, and Clefable much more easily. Alternatively, 136 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Gliscor to outspeed Hoopa-U, Adamant Landorus-T, and Timid Heatran, which means that it can use Roost first. 52 Defense EVs can also be run so that  Gliscor can avoid getting KOed by Mega Mawile's Play Rough into Sucker Punch if Toxic Orb has been activated. A more physically defensive spread consisting of 244 HP / 100 Def / 28 SpD / 136 Spe with a Jolly nature is an option to handle physical threats like Mega Charizard X and Mega Mawile better.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Ensure that Gliscor's Toxic Orb safely activates before switching it into Pokemon that can cripple it such as Lava Plume Heatran, Knock Off Mawile, or Scald Toxapex. Use Gliscor liberally early-game as a defensive check to Toxapex, Clefable, and Leftovers Heatran, as it has the staying power to easily outlast them. Gliscor can easily be overwhelmed by threats such as offensive Heatran and Mawile, so try to utilize Poison Heal in conjunction with Roost to keep it as healthy as possible throughout the game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Swords Dance Gliscor is best used on entry hazard-stacking balance teams, where it can take advantage of the switches that it forces. Stealth Rock Clefable is a phenomenal partner due to its excellent synergy and a shared resilience to hazards. Greninja and Ferrothorn are both great Spikes users. Gliscor's most common offensive check is Ash-Greninja; so be sure to have a strong switch-in like Toxapex or Ferrothorn. Choice Scarf Magnezone can trap Steel-types not suceptible to Earthquake, namely Mega Scizor and Celesteela, allowing Gliscor to more freely break through the opposing team. Finally, setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Mega Latias and Shift Gear Magearna benefit from Gliscor's ability to break down opposing teams and can sweep late-game.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Gliscor is an effective user of Stealth Rock, being able to set it up against slower Pokemon such as Heatran, Clefable, and Toxapex due to its natural bulk and pseudo-immunity to status. Earthquake provides Gliscor with a reliable STAB move that allows it to avoid remaining passive, threatening prominent offensive Pokemon such as Heatran and Tapu Koko. Toxic is used to cripple Pokemon like Tornadus-T, Landorus-T, and Tapu Bulu. U-turn could also be run to pivot out to wallbreaking teammates such as Kyurem-B, Mega Medicham, and Tapu Lele as bulkier Pokemon switch into Gliscor, and it allows Gliscor to pivot out of Ground-immune Defog users such as Tornadus-T and Landorus-T. Roost lets Gliscor stay healthy throughout the match, letting it switch into threatening Pokemon reliably, namely Heatran, as well as allowing Gliscor to set up Stealth Rock multiple times throughout the game.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>136 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Gliscor to outspeed Hoopa-U and Heatran. 244 HP EVs allow Gliscor to hit a HP number divisible by 8, maximizing the amount of HP it regains every turn. 52 Defense EVs allow Gliscor to survive Play Rough into Sucker Punch from Mega Mawile if Toxic Orb has been activated, and the remaining EVs are placed into Special Defense to allow Gliscor to tank special attacks such as Heatran's Magma Storm and Tapu Koko's unboosted Hidden Power Ice. Alternatively, a more physically defensive spread of 244 HP / 100 Def / 28 SpD / 136 Spe can be run to take on physical attackers like Tyranitar, Excadrill, and Mega Charizard X. Toxic Orb in conjunction with Poison Heal allows Gliscor to heal 12.5% of its HP every turn, giving it access to very strong passive recovery as well as a pseudo-immunity to status.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Set up Stealth Rock early in games against Pokemon that don't threaten Gliscor or are forced out, such as Clefable without Calm Mind and Heatran, so that the opponent's Pokemon are worn down quicker; however, be wary of Ice Beam and Inferno Overdrive from each of these Pokemon, respectively. Use U-turn liberally so that Gliscor can pivot into wallbreakers often and they can decimate the opposing team. Use Roost after switching into Pokemon like Heatran so that Gliscor can check them later on in the match. Avoid staying in and using Earthquake too much with Gliscor, as it gives free momentum to Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Mega Latios, but use it if need be. Most of the time, you should use U-turn when you believe a Ground-immune Pokemon such as Landorus or Mega Latios is coming in to maintain offensive pressure.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Gliscor is usually used on offensive teams that want a Stealth Rock user that switches into Heatran and can act as a status absorber that doesn't lose momentum. Wallbreakers such as Kyurem-B and Ash-Greninja appreciate Gliscor's ability to slowly pivot into them without needing them to take damage as they switch in. Late-game cleaners such as Mega Lopunny and Swords Dance Mega Pinsir appreciate Gliscor's ability to wear down the opposing team with both Stealth Rock and repeated U-turns into wallbreakers. Additionally, other users of U-turn and Volt Switch, such as Tapu Koko and Mega Scizor, can form a VoltTurn core with Gliscor and maintain offensive pressure throughout the game.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Defog is used to remove entry hazards from the field and pairs nicely with Gliscor's defensive typing. Roost provides Gliscor with a reliable form of recovery, allowing it to stay healthy throughout the match and have more chances to utilize Defog. Knock Off allows Gliscor to cripple Pokemon such as Celesteela. Alternatively, Toxic can be run to nail common Ground-type switch-ins such as Tapu Bulu, Tornadus-T, and Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>244 HP EVs increase Gliscor's general bulk and maximize the amount of HP recovered from Poison Heal. A Jolly nature with 136 Speed EVs ensures that Gliscor outruns Timid Heatran and Hoopa-U. 52 Defense EVs let Gliscor avoid the KO from Play Rough into Sucker Punch from Mega Mawile if Toxic Orb has been activated. A physically defensive spread of 244 HP / 100 Def / 28 SpD / 136 Spe can be used to better check physical attackers such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Mawile, and Choice Band Tyranitar. However, this set is generally inferior due to how common Heatran, Tapu Koko, and Magearna all are.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Avoid bringing in Gliscor into a possible Knock Off, Scald, or Will-O-Wisp at all costs before Toxic Orb has been activated, as it risks neutering the effects of Poison Heal. Once poisoned, Gliscor can easily wall defensive hazard setters such as Toxapex, defensive Landorus-T, and specially defensive Heatran. Don't hesitate to bring it in versus these Pokemon, as Gliscor can force them out and use this as a free opportunity to remove entry hazards or spread status.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Defog Gliscor can be used on many archetypes ranging from stall to offense, but it most commonly finds itself featured on balance teams. Pokemon that can pivot into Ice-type attacks for Gliscor such as Tapu Fini, Magearna, or Heatran make excellent teammates. Toxapex deserves a special mention, as it has excellent defensive synergy with Gliscor and can set up Toxic Spikes to wear down defensive Pokemon as well as bait in Pokemon that Gliscor can usually beat. Finally, offensive Pokemon that appreciate entry hazards off the field such as Volcarona, Charizard, and Weavile benefit from Gliscor's ability to Defog.</p> "

  "Mamoswine": {
    "overview": "<p>Mamoswine's primary role in OU is as a wallbreaker due to its high Attack stat and fantastic Ice- and Ground-type STAB combination that is very difficult to deal with defensively. It also has good utility due to its priority Ice Shard, threatening prevalent Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Access to Stealth Rock and its Ground typing are some of the main traits that help it fit onto teams, as both are invaluable. However, Mamoswine suffers competition from other Stealth Rock setters and Ground-type wallbreakers such as Landorus-T and Garchomp due to its mediocre Speed stat and subpar defenses, leaving it vulnerable to a lot of offensive Pokemon. Inability to reliably beat common priority users like Ash-Greninja and Mega Scizor further worsens Mamoswine's Speed issues. Overall, Mamoswine is a decent Pokemon but requires more team support than the most common Ground-types in the tier.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Superpower can hit Ferrothorn, but that's about it. Substitute can be used to ease prediction, but the utility Stealth Rock and Knock Off provide isn't worth dropping most of the time.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Mega Scizor is the biggest threat to Mamoswine due to its ability to tank multiple Earthquakes and use Roost to heal off the damage while threatening Mamoswine with Bullet Punch. Celesteela and Skarmory also eat Mamoswine's attacks pretty well but don't check it as well offensively and can be taken down with boosts from Metronome and timely Icicle Crash flinch. Ferrothorn can take any two attacks from Mamoswine if it's not fully specially defensive but does not have reliable recovery and cannot switch in repeatedly.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Offensive Water-types such as Ash-Greninja and Manaphy threaten to OHKO Mamoswine with super effective STAB moves. More defensive Water-types such as Rotom-W, Mega Slowbro, and Alomomola can switch into Mamoswine relatively well and threaten it out.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Pokemon such as Kartana, Tapu Lele, and Volcarona all naturally outspeed Mamoswine and threaten to OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: The likes of Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Gallade, while being unable to switch directly in on Mamoswine, naturally outpace it and can OHKO Mamoswine with their super effective STAB moves.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Ice Shard helps Mamoswine check Pokemon such as Garchomp and Landorus-T as well as pick off other weakened threats. Mamoswine makes a good use of Stealth Rock, since its great STAB coverage enables it to find many opportunities to set it up against Pokemon it threatens out. Knock Off, on the other hand, cripples Mamoswine's answers like Celesteela and defensive Rotom-W by removing their items for the rest of the battle.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>An Adamant nature is the preferred option, since Jolly doesn't allow Mamoswine to outspeed anything notable and lowers its firepower. Thick Fat is the ability of choice to reduce the damage Mamoswine takes from Fire- and Ice-type moves. Metronome is used to bypass would-be-checks such as Celesteela and Mega Scizor over time.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mamoswine should be used as a wallbreaker to threaten defensive backbones that cannot stomach powerful Ice- and Ground-type attacks. Icicle Crash is often the primary option, because nothing is immune to it and Ice-type attacks are generally very difficult to switch into. In general, one should weigh the risk and reward scenario presented to them and select their move based on that; Earthquake might not lose you too much against a team whose Ground switch-in is Landorus-T. Mamoswine can also be used to check faster threats such as Garchomp with Ice Shard; you can use this opportunity to predict a switch and go for more powerful STAB attacks as well. Mamoswine shouldn't be directly switched in very often, as it has relatively poor defenses, but it can be used in some cases to block Volt Switch from Pokemon such as Magearna and Tapu Koko if you predict correctly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Due to its great offensive presence and relative frailty, Mamoswine fits best on offensive teams that can give it proper support. VoltTurn pivots like Rotom-W, Tapu Koko, and Magnezone can bring Mamoswine in on bulky Grass-types, which these three tend to lure in, for free so Mamoswine can force them out and take advantage of it The likes of Tapu Fini and Tangrowth take on offensive Water-types, mainly Ash-Greninja, for Mamoswine; the latter also checks Kartana. Ash-Greninja appreciates Mamoswine's ability to threaten most of its defensive stops like Toxapex and Tangrowth while also creating a hazard stacking core with Mamoswine.</p> "

Furthermore, Porygon-Z's low stats, except Special Attack, mean that it's hard to find setup opportunities due to low defenses and lack of resistances, so Porygon-Z is outclassed by better setup sweepers like Magearna.

Porygon-Z isn't worth using, though, as it struggles to break past common defensive or just bulky Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Tyranitar, and the metagame has more consistent setup sweepers requiring less support like Magearna and Mega Mawile due to their better movesets and typings.</p> "}],

  "Rotom-Wash": {
    "overview": "<p>Rotom-W makes a great pivot for offensive teams thanks to its good typing, bulk, and set versatility. It's immune to Ground-type attacks from Landorus-T, Gliscor, Sand Rush Excadrill, and Mamoswine and Spikes while also checking other popular threats like Heatran, Tornadus-T, Manaphy, and Greninja. Checking Ground-types and Heatran also makes it a good Defog user, since they are all very common Stealth Rock setters, and its lack of passivity compared to Defog users like Gliscor or Zapdos is important for offensive teams, featuring a decently strong Hydro Pump and Volt Switch to keep momentum. It's also great against rain teams, being one of the best answers to Mega Swampert and other rain threats like the aforementioned Greninja, Tornadus-T, and Manaphy. This defensive profile lets Rotom-W come in, force out Ground-types with Hydro Pump, and easily pivot in offensive teammates with Volt Switch while wearing down foes. Rotom-W can also burn switch-ins like Ferrothorn, Mega Latios, Mega Latias, and Tapu Bulu with Will-O-Wisp, punishing them without having to switch out. Will-O-Wisp is also great to reduce prediction, since most Pokemon that can switch into Hydro Pump or Volt Switch hate being burned. It can even run Waterium Z on its defensive set to OHKO Pokemon like Heatran, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Mega Charizard or run a more offensive set with Electrium Z that lures in and takes out bulky targets that would otherwise pivot into it, like Toxapex, Tapu Fini, and Manaphy. However, Rotom-W lacks reliable recovery, so it can sometimes struggle to pivot into what it needs to in the long run, especially if Wiki Berry Rotom-W gets hit by Knock Off from Pokemon it's meant to check, mainly Tornadus-T. Rotom-W is also vulnerable to Toxic from the Pokemon it's meant to switch into, namely Heatran and Gliscor. Lastly, while its bulk is good, it isn't good enough to comfortably answer very strong wallbreakers like Tapu Lele, Mega Mawile, and Mega Medicham.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choice Scarf variant provides some added speed and can cripple passive foes with Trick as well as generate momentum with Volt Switch. An offensive set with Hydro Pump / Volt Switch / Hidden Power Fire / Defog, Waterium Z, and an EV spread of 200 HP / 252 SpA / 56 Spe is an alternative for more offensively oriented teams. Toxic can alternatively be used to punish Gastrodon, which otherwise is completely unfazed by Rotom-W. A set utilizing a Choice item seems usable thanks to Rotom-W's bulk, decent Special Attack, and access to Trick to cripple bulkier Pokemon, but sacrificing its defensive utility is usually not worth the trade-off.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-type Pokemon resist both of Rotom-W's STAB attacks and can threaten it out with super effective attacks. While Kartana and Tapu Bulu fear a burn upon switching in, they can still effectively scare out Rotom-W. Ferrothorn and Tangrowth can come in on Rotom-W freely but can be worn down with the combination of Will-O-Wisp and Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Kyurem-B is a terrifyingly powerful Pokemon that resists both of Rotom-W's STAB moves and only partially fears a burn. Mega Latios similarly fears nothing from Rotom-W and threatens it with a 2HKO from Psychic. Garchomp similarly does not appreciate being burned, but it is capable of threatening Rotom-W with a +2 Continental Crush.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon That Can Bypass Levitate: Despite having access to Levitate, there are still Ground-types that can threaten Rotom-W. Particularly, Rotom-W has to watch out for Landorus-T's Smack Down or Gravity and Mold Breaker Earthquake from Excadrill and Mega Gyarados, as all are able to circumvent Levitate.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Rotom-W's mediocre recovery means it is very susceptible to chip damage from various sources, such as Toxic from Heatran, U-turn from Tornadus-T and Landorus-T, and Stealth Rock. Keep this in mind as you try to keep Rotom-W healthy to check what it is needed for. Gastrodon is particularly noteworthy, as it is immune to Volt Switch and Hydro Pump and can cripple Rotom-W with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Pokemon with high special bulk like Chansey, Reuniclus, and Clefable can freely switch into Rotom-W, although they all fear the threat of Volt Switch. Natural Cure and Magic Guard allow the aforementioned Pokemon to shrug off burns, and both Calm Mind Clefable and Reuniclus can use Rotom-W as setup fodder.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch helps Rotom-W maintain offensive momentum, limiting free switches in from Pokemon such as Chansey, Ferrothorn, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Latias. Thunder is Rotom-W's strongest Electric-type STAB attack and when paired with Electrium Z can heavily damage unsuspecting targets, including Toxapex, Clefable, Zapdos, and Magearna. Pain Split helps Rotom-W last longer so it can be more effective. Moreover, it can be especially helpful against bulkier teams, allowing Rotom-W to constantly pressure Pokemon such as Chansey and overall not be as easy to wear down.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>216 Speed EVs in tandem with a Timid nature allow Rotom-W to always outspeed Gyarados and Heatran. 184 Special Attack EVs ensure an OHKO on Celesteela and Toxapex with Electrium Z-boosted Thunder after Stealth Rock, a 2HKO on offensive Garchomp with Hydro Pump after Stealth Rock, and an OHKO on Weavile with Electrium Z-boosted Thunder. Waterium Z is also a viable option over Electrium Z for a better nuke against the likes of Garchomp, specially defensive Heatran, Tapu Koko, and Mega Tyranitar. By doing so, it is usually better to run Will-O-Wisp over Thunder, as without the Z-Crystal, Thunder is not as reliable.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It is important to not carelessly waste Rotom-W's Z-Move. You should be patient with using the Z-Move by making sure your opponent won't anticipate and scout for it. Try to aggressively switch Rotom-W in on a predicted switch from a Pokemon such as Toxapex or Magearna and surprise it with its Z-Move. Lots of balance and stall teams tend to rely on a single Pokemon such as Mega Latias or a defensive Grass-type like Tangrowth to check Rotom-W, so focus on removing it by bringing in a counter with Volt Switch. The main attraction of this set is the great utility Rotom-W offers with the combination of applying constant pressure with Volt Switch and Pain Split. Setting up entry hazards and pivoting to strong wallbreakers enhances Rotom-W's ability to break apart teams. Keep in mind that Rotom-W will have trouble consistently checking Pokemon such as Heatran, Tornadus-T, and Gyarados. Be careful with hard switching it in often, as Rotom-W is frail and prone to being worn down, especially when Stealth Rock is up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Scizor can switch into Grass-types that force Rotom-W out and form a potent VoltTurn core alongside it. Scizor draws in Heatran, Toxapex, and Celesteela, all of which Rotom-W can take advantage of. Additional Fire- and Flying-type checks are crucial alongside this set, as Rotom-W is not a reliable switch-in to the likes of Heatran, Hawlucha, and Tornadus-T. Calm Mind sweepers such as Clefable and Mega Latias are good teammates for Rotom-W, as it can remove surefire checks like Heatran and Toxapex, allowing them to set up and sweep a lot more easily. Clefable in particular can also aid in setting up Stealth Rock, which helps Rotom-W even more by getting more chip damage on switch-ins alongside Volt Switch. Rotom-W appreciates entry hazards to have a better chance at pressuring teams. Ferrothorn and Greninja are great partners, as they can reliably set up Spikes to help Rotom-W's Volt Switch be more impactful.</p> "

Besides providing recovery, Pain Split can punish healthy switch-ins due to Rotom-W's low base HP stat, especially Chansey, which is one of the most common switch-ins to Rotom-W on stall teams. Will-O-Wisp cripples some of its switch-ins like Tangrowth, Ferrothorn, Kyurem-B, Tapu Bulu, and Assault Vest Magearna. Toxic can be used over Defog, Pain Split, or Will-O-Wisp to more heavily cripple switch-ins that aren't as fazed by burn, like Tangrowth, Gastrodon, Serperior, Kommo-o, and Mega Latias. However, it doesn't do anything to Steel-types that check it like Ferrothorn and Magearna.</p> <p>Rotom-W can run a fully physically defensive or specially defensive set, depending on what threats its team needs it to check more. A physically defensive spread lets it better check the Ground-types of the tier, most notably Swords Dance Gliscor, as well as miscellaneous threats like Hawlucha, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Scizor. It also avoids the OHKO from Mega Mawile's Play Rough and Mega Medicham's High Jump Kick. Meanwhile, a specially defensive spread lets it more efficiently pivot into Battle Bond Greninja, Mega Alakazam, Tapu Koko, and offensive Heatran. Wiki Berry is an alternative to Pain Split that doesn't cost a turn to use, helping Rotom-W preserve momentum, pivot wallbreakers in, and switch into attacks like Greninja's Dark Pulse even when worn down, which is especially good on offensive teams. It also saves the moveslot needed for Pain Split. Waterium Z, on the other hand, lets Rotom-W OHKO Pokemon it otherwise couldn't like Gliscor, Heatran, Mega Medicham, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Alakazam while heavily damaging others like Tapu Lele, offensive Magearna, and Garchomp.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tornadus-T can check Grass-types like Kartana, Serperior, and Tapu Bulu, run Defog so Rotom-W has an extra moveslot, and switch into Mega Medicham while also forming a VoltTurn core with Rotom-W. Rotom-W pivots into Ice-type moves from Weavile and Mega Latias while also answering Heatran in return. Mega Scizor can similarly check Grass-types and form a VoltTurn core with Rotom-W while also checking strong Psychic-types like Mega Alakazam, Mega Latios, and Mega Latias, with Rotom-W answering Heatran and Tornadus-T and using Defog to aid Mega Scizor's longevity. Heatran can answer Grass-types like Kartana and Serperior, handle Fairy-types like Tapu Lele and Magearna, and spread residual damage with Stealth Rock alongside Magma Storm and Toxic. Rotom-W can answer opposing Heatran, Ground-types like Gliscor and Landorus-T, and Water-types like Mega Swampert and Greninja in return while pivoting Heatran in safely on some of its targets, like Magearna and Ferrothorn, to preserve its health. Ferrothorn can be a sturdier Water-resistant Pokemon and Grass-type check while spreading residual damage with entry hazards and using Knock Off, removing Leftovers to make Rotom-W's Volt Switch damage stick, while Rotom-W checks Heatran and Tornadus-T. Assault Vest Magearna has amazing synergy with the physically defensive set, taking strong special attacks from Pokemon like Mega Alakazam, Mega Diancie, Mega Latios, Tapu Lele, and opposing offensive Magearna while enjoying Rotom-W taking on Fire- and Ground-types. It also appreciates Rotom-W keeping entry hazards off the field to make up for its lack of recovery. The two form a solid backbone for offensive teams against Ash-Greninja, since Magearna can take Dark Pulse, while Rotom-W can take Hydro Pump and clear the Spikes it sets. Ground-types like Gliscor and Landorus-T enjoy Rotom-W taking Water- and Ice-type attacks for them, with Gliscor able to act as a strong wincon with Swords Dance and absorb status from Heatran, while Landorus-T sets up Stealth Rock and forms a good VoltTurn core with it. Pursuit users like Mega Tyranitar and Weavile can trap checks like Mega Latios, Reuniclus, and Mega Latias, with Mega Tyranitar able to set up Stealth Rock, and Weavile using Knock Off to remove bulky targets' Leftovers so Rotom-W's Volt Switch damage sticks. Both appreciate it pivoting them in safely with Volt Switch and taking strong Water-type attacks for them. Volcarona appreciates Rotom-W keeping entry hazards off the field and answering Heatran and Water-types, and it takes advantage of Volt Switch pivoting to more easily set up Quiver Dance on Pokemon like Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Latias lacking Thunder Wave.</p> "

Uxie's fantastic defensive stats also allow it to survive almost any hit and set up Trick Room in most scenarios. Despite this, Uxie is only viable on dedicated Trick Room teams, as it's completely outclassed by other Psychic-types such as Mew and Latios on any standard team. Uxie is also extremely passive, as it's unable to do much damage because of its pathetic offensive stats and because it usually can't afford to run an attacking move.

Magic Coat shouldn't be used against Stealth Rock setters such as Landorus-T, as they can predict it and just attack Uxie, but it should be used against common Spikes setters, such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn. Preserving Uxie to set up Trick Room later in the match usually isn't worth it, although if it can be done without letting a teammate take too much damage, you can do it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Uxie is only viable on dedicated Trick Room teams, so powerful, slow wallbreakers such as Crawdaunt, Stakataka, Alolan Marowak, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Mawile make for good teammates, as they can take advantage of Trick Room to the fullest potential. Uxie is usually only setting up Trick Room once a match, so other Trick Room setters such as Magearna, Stakataka, and Cresselia also make for good teammates.</p> "

  "Cresselia": {
    "overview": "<p>Cresselia possesses absurd physical and special bulk, which allows it to take on even the most threatening Pokemon in the tier such as Garchomp and most variants of offensive Landorus-T. This, combined with a great support move in Lunar Dance, makes it a reliable Trick Room setter. Lunar Dance is a particularly great asset on a Trick Room setter because it allows Cresselia to bring a fully healed teammate safely into the battle after setting Trick Room. Despite its excellent defensive capabilities, Cresseila's low Special Attack turns it into a rather passive Pokemon that can be taken advantage of by some setup sweepers like Swords Dance Mega Mawile and Quiver Dance Volcarona, meaning it will usually be forced to use Lunar Dance right after setting up Trick Room to regain momentum and prevent a sweep. It's also heavily reliant on its one-time use Mental Herb; without it, Pokemon with Taunt such as Tapu Koko and Heatran can easily shut it down.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Other items such as Leftovers and a Colbur Berry can be used providing Cresselia with extra recovery and an easier time setting up Trick Room against Dark-types once in a game, respectively. However, the lack of Mental Herb means that common Taunt users can prevent it from setting up Trick Room, making it hard to justify any of these items over it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Strong Dark-types</strong>: Choice Specs Ash-Greninja, Hoopa-U, and both Tyranitar and its Mega Evolution can 2HKO Cresseila with their respective STAB moves, meaning it can't come in on them to set up Trick Room. Pursuit trappers like Weavile can also put it in an awkward situation if it's weakened enough.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: When equipped with a Choice Specs, Gengar can 2HKO Cresselia with Shadow Ball, Mimikyu can use it as setup fodder, and Cofagrigus can take advantage of Trick Room and start setting up with Nasty Plot.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: After its Mental Herb is consumed, Pokemon with Taunt can prevent Cresselia from setting up Trick Room, bringing a teammate with Lunar Dance, or recovering with Moonlight, rendering it pretty much useless.</p> <p><strong>Status Inducers</strong>: Status conditions like poison and sleep cripple Cresselia and give it a harder time doing its job.</p> ",

        "name": "Trick Room",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Trick Room is a powerful tool against offensive teams because it allows slower teammates to move before faster opponents for five turns, thus rendering useless the opponent's offensive checks and any fast revenge killers. Ice Beam, while rather weak because of Cresselia's low Special Attack, provides Cresselia with neat coverage against the likes of Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor, which it struggles to threaten otherwise due to their modest bulk. Psychic is an optional move that hits neutral targets such as Mega Medicham harder thanks to the STAB boost and also does a significant amount of damage to Mega Heracross, a big threat to the Trick Room archetype. Moonlight lets Cresselia stay alive throughout a battle in case it finds an opportunity to set up Trick Room a second time. Finally, Lunar Dance lets Cresselia heal a teammate and bring it safely to the battle at the cost of itself.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment with a Relaxed nature minimizes the damage Cresselia takes from some strong wallbreakers such as Landorus-T and Swords Dance Garchomp, thus letting it set up Trick Room against them. No Speed IVs with a Speed-reducing nature make it as fast as possible under Trick Room. Its Levitate ability gives it a key ground immunity, allowing it to pivot into Ground-types like Landorus-T and Garchomp that threaten common Trick Room sweepers like Alolan Marowak and Magearna.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Thanks to Cresselia's immense mixed bulk, it finds plenty of opportunities to pivot into offensive threats like Landorus-T, Mega Medicham, and Mega Diancie and set up Trick Room mid-game. Once Trick Room has been set up, it should avoid staying in on the field for too long because this takes valuable time away from its teammates. Using Lunar Dance right after Trick Room is a great way of regaining momentum without wasting too many turns in pivoting around to get a Trick Room sweeper into the game. However, there are some instances where sacrificing a weakened teammate to bring a healthy one into the battle works better because it allows Cresselia to set up Trick Room again and use its Lunar Dance later. This is also helpful on instances where Cresselia needs to be preserved until the end-game to switch into an opposing threat.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set only fits on the Trick Room archetype, with potent and slow wallbreakers such as Alolan Marowak, Stakataka, Magearna, Mega Mawile, and Mega Heracross as teammates. Since it usually ends up being sacrificed after using Trick Room followed by Lunar Dance, additional Trick Room setters such as Uxie, Stakataka, and Magearna make for great partners. A suicide lead with access to Trick Room and Stealth Rock is also appreciated, as Cresselia usually won't attempt to set up Trick Room until late-game. Pokemon like Uxie and Bronzong can fulfill this role.</p> "

  "Manaphy": {
    "overview": "<p>Manaphy is one of the undisputed strongest stallbreakers in the whole tier thanks to the combination of Tail Glow and Hydration, which makes it temporarily immune to Toxic in rain, so it naturally finds itself a place on several rain teams as their countermeasure to the stall matchup. Additionally, Manaphy is also a deadly wallbreaker with a rain-boosted +3 Hydro Vortex that makes it almost effortless to weaken typical rain checks for the likes of Mega Swampert, Ash-Greninja, and Kingdra to clean up. With Psychic as coverage, Manaphy can also break past notable threats to rain, such as Toxapex and Mega Venusaur. Manaphy's great bulk all-around also gives it a plethora of opportunities to set up, and a Water-type resistance helps with the Ash-Greninja matchup in rain. However, Manaphy's relative lack of raw power makes it somewhat predictable and exploitable, as it needs to set up with Tail Glow to actually do damage, making easier to play around than most wallbreakers. This, accompanied by the fact that nearly all teams have something to outspeed it, also makes it a bit easy to play around, as it's not hard to pivot into a faster Water-resistant threat as it sets up Tail Glow, such as Serperior or Protean Greninja, and even when Manaphy does take down a Pokemon on the opposing team, it will be likely forced out by a faster threat such as Choice Specs Tapu Koko or Kartana. Manaphy is also a bit hard to fit on rain because, alongside the set-in-stone Pelipper and Mega Swampert, many builders may opt for Ash-Greninja or Kingdra over it, as they provide better Speed and a much better matchup against opposing offenses.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Leftovers can be used over Waterium Z, especially on Rest variants, if Manaphy's team already packs a Z-Move user, but struggling to break past other Water-types like Tapu Fini and Rotom-W isn't quite ideal. Energy Ball helps out with Gastrodon and lets Manaphy save its Z-Move against Tapu Fini and Rotom-W; however, Manaphy can't break past Toxapex and Mega Venusaur without Psychic. Z-Rain Dance is an interesting option for some hyper offensive teams, but more often than not, there are far better sweepers to do the job.</p> <p>Ice Beam is an option over Psychic on the Rest set to hit bulky Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu and allows Manaphy to conserve its Z-Move versus Mega Latias. However, it has limited targets and forces Manaphy to use its Z-Move on Toxapex and Mega Venusaur. Rain Dance is also an option over Psychic on the Rest set to let Manaphy be self-sufficient against stall, but this leaves it unable to break past Gastrodon lacking Clear Smog and Toxapex.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Mantine is arguably Manaphy's greatest enemy, being able to wall Manaphy indefinitely and Haze any boosts off. Gastrodon is an excellent check, but Rest variants can beat non-Clear Smog Gastrodon one-on-one. Toxapex struggles with Psychic variants and Rest variants if it's not running Haze; however, it can still be a nuisance to Manaphy otherwise. Lastly, Tapu Fini and Rotom-W resist Manaphy's Water-type STAB moves but are vulnerable to a +3 Hydro Vortex in rain.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: The likes of Assault Vest Amoonguss and Ferrothorn take very little damage from whatever Manaphy attempts to do and deal heavy damage with their Grass-type STAB moves. Non-Assault Vest Amoonguss, Tapu Bulu, and Tangrowth are in a similar boat, but they take considerably more from +3 Ice Beam. Mega Venusaur takes on the few variants that lack Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Mega Latias: Mega Latias switches in seamlessly against Manaphy, and variants packing Psyshock, the rarer Thunderbolt, or Energy Ball can 2HKO it.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster attackers that can OHKO Manaphy, such as Kartana and Tapu Koko, are threats to be careful of, especially if they manage to pivot in as Manaphy sets up. However, other faster attackers can pick it off after some damage, such as Garchomp, Flyinium Z Tornadus-T, Mega Alakazam, and Mega Lopunny.</p> ",

        "name": "2 Attacks + Rest",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rest, in conjunction with Hydration, allows Manaphy to recover all of its HP without consequence while rain is active. Surf is recommended over Scald due to its higher Base Power; Hydro Vortex coming off of Scald notably fails to achieve several notable OHKOs versus targets such as Mega Latias and Chansey at +3, and the added benefit of burns does not help in wearing down the majority of its checks. Ice Beam targets Mega Latias, Tapu Bulu, and Tangrowth without having to use its Z-Move, while Psychic enables Manaphy to break past Toxapex and Mega Venusaur. Toxic can be used instead of a coverage move to annoy Gastrodon and Rotom-W, OHKO Shedinja, and chip away at Grass-types like Tangrowth long-term.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>20 Speed EVs allow Manaphy to outspeed Timid Magnezone. Waterium Z provides Manaphy with a strong tool to break past specially bulky Pokemon such as Chansey and Assault Vest Magearna as well as Water-type switch-ins such as Mega Latias and Ferrothorn after a Tail Glow boost. An alternative EV spread of 48 HP / 252 SpA / 208 Spe with a Modest nature can be used to outspeed Gyarados and Tapu Fini but comes at the cost of significantly reducing Manaphy's bulk.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>To maximize Manaphy's effectiveness as a stallbreaker, aim to have rain active as much as you can; the boost it provides Water-type moves allows a boosted Manaphy to break past usual checks such as Mega Latias and Ferrothorn with Hydro Vortex while also providing more opportunities for Manaphy to use Rest. Rest enables Manaphy to be played much more aggressively; HP conservation is not as important when it is able to recover lost HP without much consequence. As such, do not be afraid to use Manaphy to weaken or remove bulkier foes, as it is easily able to find chances to freely recover on passive Pokemon such as Celesteela, Toxapex, and Gastrodon. However, Manaphy should avoid using Rest on the last active turn of rain, as rain will end before Hydration gets a chance to activate. Be sure to conserve Manaphy's Z-Move for bulkier targets such as Ferrothorn, Mega Latias, and Tangrowth, as they become more difficult to break past without it.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Manaphy should only be used on rain builds. As such, Pelipper is a mandatory partner for Manaphy; it allows Manaphy to take advantage of Hydration and heal freely with Rest while also boosting the power of Manaphy's Water-type moves, allowing it to bypass some of the sturdiest defensive threats such as Mega Latias and Chansey. Ferrothorn also serves as an excellent partner for Manaphy; it provides Manaphy with entry hazard support while also being able to pivot into Tapu Koko and Mega Latias. Additionally, it possesses the ability to lure in and cripple Pokemon such as Assault Vest Tangrowth and opposing Ferrothorn with Knock Off, making them significantly easier for Manaphy to break through. Other rain staples such as Mega Swampert, Ash-Greninja, and Tornadus-T all appreciate Manaphy's ability to wear down traditional rain checks such as Toxapex, Chansey, and Rotom-W and are able to pivot into some of Manaphy's checks; the former pivots into Tapu Koko and the last into Grass-types such as Kartana and Tapu Bulu.</p> "

        "name": "Three Attacks",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Surf's added power makes it the preferred STAB move over Scald. Ice Beam is instrumental to break past Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu and Dragon-types like Mega Latias, Mega Latios, Hydreigon, and Kommo-o. Psychic helps out against Toxapex and Mega Venusaur, both of which can be notable annoyances to rain teams.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Waterium Z gives Manaphy a strong nuke in Hydro Vortex that can plow through Water-resistant Pokemon like Tapu Fini and Rotom-W at +3 in rain. Hydration helps Manaphy rid itself of Toxic from the likes of Chansey and Toxapex under rain. A Timid nature is preferred to outspeed the likes of Hydreigon, Tapu Lele, Kyurem, and Kyurem-B.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>An important aspect of using Manaphy is deciding whether to attack straight away or to set up. If your opponent has a healthy check to Manaphy, such as Gastrodon, specially defensive Tapu Bulu, Amoonguss, or Assault Vest Tangrowth, it might be smart to double switch instead of trying to set up. If your opponent has a faster threat that can knock out Manaphy, such as Tapu Koko or Kartana, don't let them in for free as you set up a Tail Glow; sometimes, it's better to just attack them on the switch, especially if your team doesn't have a dedicated switch-in. Keep Manaphy healthy if it can potentially break a team; it can stomach a hit from the likes of Tapu Fini, Mega Venusaur, and Tangrowth if it needs to, and it can check threats to rain such as Ash-Greninja, for example. Don't be scared of letting Manaphy get inflicted by status as long as your Pelipper is healthy; however, if you're using it outside of a rain team, be very wary of Toxic from Chansey and Gastrodon.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Rain support from Pelipper is highly recommended, as Manaphy only excels as a stallbreaker thanks to Hydration, and the Water-type boost from rain is more than welcome, especially for breaking Chansey and opposing Water-types. Teammates such as Mega Swampert, Ash-Greninja, and Kingdra appreciate typical rain checks getting weakened by Manaphy and can make up for Manaphy's subpar Speed. Mega Swampert also provides a very useful Electric-type immunity. While Manaphy helps with Ash-Greninja, other checks such as Ferrothorn, Magearna, and the aforementioned Kingdra help solidify the matchup, as Ash-Greninja is a deadly threat to rain teams.</p> "

  "Victini": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to an insanely high Base Power STAB attack in V-create, a great coverage option in Bolt Strike, and utility in U-turn and Trick, Victini can operate effectively in OU as either a Choice Scarf or Choice Band user. Victini's unique typing and good bulk gives it many opportunities to switch in against common threats in the OU tier and wreak havoc. Alternatively, Victini can use a Z-Celebrate set to boost all its stats once per match, becoming a terrifying late-game sweeper that can be difficult to revenge kill. Stored Power is very strong after a boost, and with a useful coverage option in Focus Blast, Victini has the ability to shred through common defensive cores as well as offensive teams. Its good bulk and somewhat useful resistances give Victini plenty of chances to setup. Unfortunately, Victini's average attacking stats forces it to heavily rely on Z-Celebrate's boosts in order to pose much of a threat when running this set. Furthermore, Victini's typing causes it to be weak to every form of entry hazard as well as common priority, such as Sucker Punch and Water Shuriken.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Victini has an expansive offensive movepool, featuring good options such as Glaciate, Blue Flare, Thunder, Energy Ball, Shadow Ball. Victini can use said movepool to function as either a mixed or special attacker with an Expert Belt or Choice Specs, though it usually breaks much more of the metagame when functioning as a physical wallbreaker. Trick Room is an option for taking advantage of V-create's Speed drops; however, Victini is often too fast to make use of Trick Room and is more effective as a moderately fast wallbreaker anyway.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Garchomp and Mega Charizard X can somewhat reliably check Victini thanks to their resistance to V-create and Bolt Strike. Mega Latios and Mega Latias are also troublesome due to their resistances to Victini's STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Water-types such as Mega Slowbro and Alomomola resist V-create and only really need to watch out for Choice Banded Bolt Strike.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Some of OU's Ground-type Pokemon are bulky enough to tank an attack from Victini and threaten it with super effective Ground-type attacks. Examples include Mega Swampert, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon, which can also use Whirlwind to get rid of Victini's boosts.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit: Pursuit trappers such as Weavile and Tyranitar are able to trap Victini if it's locked into Zen Headbutt or sometimes even V-create in Tyranitar's case. Victini is also very vulnerable to being revenge killed by them after using V-create.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Due to Victini's average Speed, it is outsped and threatened by common Pokemon in Greninja, Tapu Koko, Mega Diancie, and Kingdra in rain.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>U-turn allows Victini to gain momentum and deal chip damage to Fire-resistant switch-ins like Tyranitar and Mega Latias. Final Gambit lets Victini quickly remove or force damage on a problematic Pokemon. It's particularly useful for getting rid of checks like Mega Latias, Heatran, and Toxapex, which may open the door for a teammate that shares these checks with Victini. Trick cripples walls such as Toxapex. If the opponent has multiple defensive stops to Victini such as Tyranitar, Heatran, and Gliscor, the move ensures that Victini isn't limited to getting a single KO with Final Gambit. Bolt Strike can be run over Final Gambit to hit Water-types such as Toxapex and Tapu Fini.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP investment ensures that Final Gambit deals as much damage as possible when Victini is healthy. If Victini is running Bolt Strike, maximum Attack investment should be used instead to secure the 2HKO on Toxapex and Tapu Fini. Choice Scarf turns Victini into an effective revenge killer, letting it outspeed threats such as Mega Medicham, Mega Alakazam, and non-Choice Scarf Kartana.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Think twice before using V-create if the opponent has an obvious switch-in to it, such as Heatran, Toxapex, or Tyranitar. U-turn is often a safer play, especially if Victini has another teammate that can deal with the threat that's in front of it. Consider using Final Gambit if doing so will significantly help out one of Victini's teammates by removing a shared check. For example, removing Mega Latias is highly beneficial for teammates like Kartana and Swords Dance Gliscor. Preserve Victini's health as much as possible before using Final Gambit; don't unnecessarily switch it into Stealth Rock or strong attacks. Final Gambit can be used early-game in order to immediately force a trade, which can be helpful against offensive teams. Trick should be used against defensive teams that rely on walls like Toxapex to check Victini.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that benefit from Victini's ability to lure in checks like Mega Latias, Heatran, and Toxapex and KO them with Final Gambit make for good teammates. These include Pokemon such as Kartana, Swords Dance Gliscor, and Mega Scizor. Victini is susceptible to all entry hazards and has a Stealth Rock weakness, so it really appreciates Defog support. Tapu Fini is an excellent Defogger to pair with Victini because it can reliably switch into entry hazard setters like Heatran, Ash-Greninja, and Toxapex that trouble it. Gliscor is another great Defogger that can deal with Heatran, Toxapex, Tyranitar, and most Ground-types. Tornadus-T and Zapdos are solid Defoggers that can switch into Ground-type attacks for Victini as well. Solid answers to Water-types, particularly Ash-Greninja, are needed. Kommo-o checks Ash-Greninja, Tyranitar, and Heatran for Victini and pressures defensive cores with its Z-Move and coverage options. Assault Vest Tangrowth checks Ash-Greninja and Ground-types like Landorus-T and Garchomp, and it can use Earthquake or Knock Off in order to weaken Heatran. Rotom-W deals with Ground-types like Landorus-T, Mega Swampert, and Hippowdon in addition to Heatran and brings Victini in against Grass-types with Volt Switch, making it an exemplary partner. Wallbreakers benefit from the U-turn support Victini provides and help to break through defensive cores. Mega Medicham and Hoopa-U are notable examples, since they threaten many of Victini's switch-ins including Heatran, Tyranitar, Toxapex, and Mega Latias.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Bolt Strike is strong coverage, nailing Toxapex and other Water-types and significantly chunking Heatran. U-turn not only gives Victini a strong move to pivot with but also does substantial damage to Mega Latios and Tyranitar. Zen Headbutt is a secondary STAB attack that can be occasionally useful to ease prediction, such as against the core Toxapex + Landorus-T. Brick Break OHKOes Tyranitar one-on-one, preventing it from Pursuit trapping Victini, and 2HKOes bulkier Heatran variants that are only 3HKOed by Bolt Strike. Trick can cripple certain targets, but few Pokemon manage to wall Choice Band Victini anyway.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Victini's good defensive typing to bring it in as often as possible, such as against Tapu Lele, Clefable, and Tapu Bulu or Power Whip from Ferrothorn, Giga Drain from Tangrowth, Leaf Blade and Sacred Sword from Kartana, and Fleur Cannon from Magearna. Play aggressively with Victini; good prediction skills are important to effectively wallbreak against common cores such as Landorus-T + Heatran. Be wary of using V-create against teams with Tyranitar or Weavile, as it leaves Victini very prone to being trapped by Pursuit.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tapu Koko is an excellent partner, using Volt Switch or U-turn to bring in Victini against bulky Grass-types to fire off strong V-creates. It also sets Electric Terrain, helping Victini muscle through Heatran. Defog support is paramount; Stealth Rock and Spikes wear down Victini incredibly quickly, preventing it from checking Tapu Lele and Tapu Bulu effectively. Toxic Spikes are a nuisance for Victini, too, putting it on a timer. Good options for Defoggers include Zapdos and Mega Latios, the latter of which checks Heatran and baits in Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Scizor for Victini. Good Ash-Greninja checks are also important partners; while any of Victini's moves will OHKO it, Ash-Greninja is very effective at coming in after a KO or on a double switch and applying pressure with strong STAB attacks, so Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, and Magearna are good partners.</p> "

        "name": "Z-Celebrate",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Celebrate works in conjunction with Normalium Z to give Victini a +1 boost in all of its stats except for accuracy and evasion, turning it into a lethal sweeper under the right conditions and making it tough to revenge kill thanks to the defensive boosts. Blue Flare is incompatible with Celebrate, which makes Searing Shot the best Fire-type STAB move for this set; it does good damage after a boost, though it's weak unboosted. STAB Stored Power gets boosted to 120-Base Power after Z-Celebrate is used. It's used over other Psychic-type moves like Psychic and Psyshock because it allows Victini to OHKO Toxapex, thus avoiding Haze from it, as well as Alolan Marowak and Tapu Koko. Focus Blast hits Heatran and Tyranitar super effectively, which otherwise wall this set.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Z-Celebrate can only be used once, so ensure that Victini's checks and counters are worn down or eliminated before it attempts to sweep. Once Victini's set up, all it has to do is pick the right coverage move and start getting KOs. Victini can attempt to spread burns early-game in some matchups thanks to Searing Shot's high burn chance, though that's pretty much all it can do before setting up due to its poor coverage without Stored Power and lack of breaking power without a boost. If there's a Choice Scarf user on the opposing team like Garchomp or Keldeo, it should try to avoid taking too much damage while setting up in order to survive a Hydro Pump from Keldeo or an Earthquake from Garchomp. When facing stall, Victini can't do anything until Chansey is removed, so try to remove it either through trapping it or with a lure. While Unaware Clefable may seem like another roadblock for Victini, it can't wall Victini if it loses its Leftovers because Searing Shot's burns will slowly wear it down and put it in range of Victini's attacks.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Victini is weak to Stealth Rock and doesn't like being poisoned by Toxic Spikes, so Defog users like Mew, Mantine, and Mega Scizor make for good teammates for an easier time sweeping. Bulky Water-types such as Mantine and Gastrodon need to be weakened for Victini to clean up more effectively, so teammates like Ash-Greninja and Heatran that can pressure them early-game are appreciated. Ash-Greninja can also set up Spikes for it. Spikes users like Ferrothorn and Greninja help Victini muscle through bulkier foes such as Mew thanks to the additional chip damage. Victini can't threaten Chansey even after a boost due to its sky-high Special Defense, which gives it a bad stall matchup as long as Chansey is alive. Therefore, teammates that can lure in or pressure Chansey like Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele can help Victini in this regard. Pursuit users like Tyranitar and Weavile can remove Mega Latias for Victini, which can be a pain to break through. They can also force mind games against Chansey and weaken it for Victini. Smeargle is an interesting partner, as it sets up Sticky Web for Victini, thus making it impossible to revenge kill after the Z-Celebrate boost.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Serperior's ability to spam Leaf Storm and receive a Special Attack boost due to Contrary makes it a fantastic cleaner for offensively inclined teams that require its ability to handle various threats such as Tapu Bulu, Clefable, and Tapu Koko. A good matchup against Sticky Web teams due to Contrary and the ability to overpower balance staples such as Clefable and Toxapex makes Serperior excellent against a good portion of the meta. Serperior is also able to take advantage of its switch-ins through the use of Substitute, allowing it to safely use Glare to cripple offensive threats, or Leech Seed to annoy passive Pokemon, limiting its defensive counterplay. Additionally, an amazing Speed tier lets Serperior outspeed many relevant offensive threats such as Mega Latios, Kartana, and Mega Medicham. However, its mediocre bulk means it's a Grass-type that is unable to check Ash-Greninja and switch into strong attacks, and a bad Special Attack stat also means Serperior struggles to deal damage right away.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dropping Hidden Power Fire and running a Glare + Leech Seed set is a possible option, although it leaves Serperior incapable of dealing with sturdy Grass-resistant Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor. It also comes with PP problems and reliance on Leech Seed for damage to save PP. A Defog + Synthesis set is able to remove hazards against the likes of Clefable, Ferrothorn, and Toxapex while keeping itself healthy. This set is unable to handle Heatran, however, which therefore is able to keep up its hazards.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Pressure Users: Moltres sports a positive type advantage versus Serperior and PP stalls its Leaf Storms. Zapdos is a shakier check, but Heat Wave does over half and Zapdos can spam Roost enough to use up all of Serperior's Leaf Storms, although Leech Seed variants can give it some trouble. Even Suicune behind a Substitute is able to PP stall Serperior by repeatedly using Protect and Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Although all of OU's viable Fire-types are annoyed by Glare or Leech Seed, they're all able to handle Serperior decently well. Heatran, Blacephalon, and Mega Charizard Y can throw off super effective attacks, while Volcarona, Victini, and Mega Charizard X can use Serperior as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Kyurem-B, Mega Latios, Mega Latias, and Hydreigon can all pivot into Serperior and deal heavy damage with their respective STAB moves or Ice-type coverage while keeping themselves healthy with Roost, although none enjoy being hit by Glare.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Mega Venusaur, Amoonguss, and Assault Vest Tangrowth are all able to handle Serperior with their access to Sludge Bomb, as well as Clear Smog in Amoonguss's case. Mega Venusaur also has a neutrality to Hidden Power Fire due to Thick Fat, and Amoonguss and Tangrowth both utilize Regenerator, which makes them harder to chip down.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Celesteela and all Magearna sets have the potential to beat Serperior one-on-one, although Glare can help Serperior muscle past them in conjunction with boosted Hidden Power Fires.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Massive special bulk, access to reliable recovery, and Natural Cure healing off status makes Chansey somewhat of an obstacle, although it dislikes Leech Seed + Substitute in tandem with boosted Leaf Storms.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority</strong>: Faster offensive Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Mega Alakazam, and Mega Lopunny can put a quick end to Serperior's sweep, although Glare can alleviate this problem. Serperior is also vulnerable to strong priority from the likes of Mega Mawile and Mega Pinsir.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hidden Power Fire allows Serperior to hit sturdy Grass-resistant Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor. Substitute takes advantage of passive threats that rely on status or are too weak to break it in one turn, such as Toxapex and Rotom-W. Glare is used to cripple switch-ins such as Tornadus-T and Heatran and also to paralyze offensive threats such as Mega Alakazam, Mega Latios, and Volcarona. Leech Seed can be used over Glare to allow Serperior to wear down and eventually beat its checks such as Heatran, Zapdos, and Assault Vest Magearna.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>56 HP investment prevents Serperior's Substitute from being broken by Rotom-W's Hydro Pump and Ferrothorn's Power Whip, while the remaining EVs are placed into Speed and Special Attack.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Due to its mediocre bulk, avoid switching Serperior into strong attacks, as they will leave it heavily weakened. Thus, Serperior should attempt to safely get on the field against threats it has a good matchup against, such as Garchomp and Ferrothorn. Make sure to conserve Leaf Storm's limited PP. Attempt to use Glare against Serperior's checks as they switch in, as most of its targets such as Kyurem-B, Tornadus-T, and Heatran can either OHKO Serperior or deal heavy damage to it if they don't get fully paralyzed. Similarly to Glare, if using Leech Seed, predict switch-ins and use Leech Seed as they come in; afterwards, use Substitute repeatedly to let Leech Seed wear down the target while keeping Serperior safe from damage and status. Certain Pokemon that Serperior otherwise handles well can run status moves to cripple it, such as Clefable with Thunder Wave, so try to scout for those moves with Substitute and avoid status as a whole, since it prevents Serperior from properly wallbreaking. Serperior can be used early in the match to weaken defensive walls for teammates, but it can also be conserved to be an effective late-game cleaner, so make sure to use it wisely.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Offense staples such as Magearna and Mega Medicham are prime partners for Serperior, as they pressure Heatran and help Serperior break down teams, especially in tandem with Glare support. Ribombee is also a good partner, as Serperior punishes Defog due to Contrary and can deal with Rapid Spin Excadrill by using Substitute to avoid Toxic. U-turn and Volt Switch users such as Tapu Koko, Choice Scarf Greninja, and Assault Vest Magearna can get Serperior on the field safely against passive walls such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex. All three examples also help against Ash-Greninja thanks to their Dark resistance. Wallbreakers such as Mega Mawile, Mega Medicham, and Ash-Greninja all enjoy their checks getting paralyzed in order to break through them more easily. In addition, both Greninja formes can utilize Spikes and also keep up the pressure against Tornadus-T and Heatran. Heatran itself is an ideal partner, as it's able to draw in Water-types that Serperior can take advantage of such as Gastrodon, Rotom-W, and Tapu Fini while being able to threaten Steel-types that Serperior struggles with like Celesteela and Magearna. Water-type teammates such as Toxapex and Gastrodon are appreciated, as they handle Ash-Greninja while easing the matchup versus certain Fire-types such as Heatran, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard Y.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Glare is used to paralyze fast threats that could be an issue for slower builds and cripple switch-ins to Serperior like Heatran, Mega Scizor, and Tornadus-T to increase its chances of breaking past them later on. Defog can remove entry hazards in a pinch, allowing teammates at low HP to have one more go. Knock Off can help with removing items like Assault Vest and Leftovers, which could later help Serperior break past certain Pokemon that would otherwise wall it, like Assault Vest Tangrowth and Magearna and Leftovers Celesteela and Ferrothorn. Removing Chansey's Eviolite can also be very helpful. Hidden Power Fire is an option over either Defog, if your team doesn't need the added entry hazard control, or Knock Off and complements Leaf Storm by weakening Grass- and Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor that can take multiple Leaf Storms with relative ease while also being able to revenge kill Choice Scarf Kartana. Toxic is another option that helps with breaking Pokemon like Zapdos and Tangrowth.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed with a Choice Scarf and a Timid nature lets Serperior outspeed most of the tier due to its great Speed tier, including opposing Choice Scarf users like Landorus-T and Kartana that could otherwise revenge kill it and naturally faster Pokemon like Mega Alakazam and Ash-Greninja.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Serperior's main purpose is to clean late-game, when the opponent's Grass-type answers have been weakened and counters have been eliminated. Try to weaken opposing Pokemon that can take Leaf Storm with the rest of your team, and with Serperior's support options, as this increases Serperior's chances to clean. Until this has been accomplished, Serperior will mostly find itself using Glare and Knock Off to support its teammates before it's ready to clean. As Leaf Storm only has 8 PP, it is important to keep track of how many times you need to use it late-game. Pressure users like Zapdos and Kyurem quickly drain PP, so watch out for those. Glare can paralyze offensive switch-ins, easing up Serperior's job, while also providing speed control for slower Pokemon on your team that appreciate faster checks being crippled. Because of the great pressure Serperior often exerts on bulkier builds, it gets many opportunities to use Defog when forcing a switch. Using Knock Off to remove Leftovers on switch-ins like Heatran, Celesteela, and Ferrothorn, Eviolite from Chansey, or the occasional Assault Vest from Tangrowth or Magearna could also be very beneficial for Serperior's chances to clean up.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Serperior is often found on more offensive builds, as the role compression it provides is often very useful. Slow wallbreakers like Mega Heracross and Mega Mawile appreciate the Glare support that Serperior provides, as it further helps them with punching holes and breaking through the opponent's team without having to worry about getting revenge killed by a faster check. Breaking past walls with these Pokemon also helps Serperior out late-game by increasing its chances to clean. Stealth Rock setters like Landorus-T and Heatran and Spikers like Ash-Greninja provide good teammates, as the chip damage from their entry hazards makes Leaf Storm harder to switch into. Magnezone's Magnet Pull is very helpful in trapping Steel-types, which can often provide trouble for Serperior. Heatran is a great partner, as it beats Steel-types like Celesteela and Ferrothorn and Fire-types like certain variants of Mega Charizard X and Volcarona, which both resist Leaf Storm and can often easily stop Serperior's attempts at cleaning if at high enough HP. Ash-Greninja is another great partner, as it can offensively pressure Steel- and Fire-types as well, which helps out Serperior a lot. Mega Alakazam can help with weakening Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Heatran for Serperior, and in return it appreciates the Knock Off support Serperior provides.</p> "

  "Excadrill": {
    "overview": "<p>Excadrill's great defensive typing allows it to check a variety of Fairy- and Electric-types in the meta, primarily Tapu Koko, Magearna, and Tapu Lele, and access to Rapid Spin lets it support entry hazard-weak teammates like Volcarona. Sand Rush enables Excadrill to become a threatening sweeper, as it outspeeds the entire metagame in sand and can boost its already great Attack to even higher levels with Swords Dance. However, outside of sand, Excadrill isn't very fast, which can leave it prone to breakers like Mega Medicham and Volcarona. Sand Rush Excadrill is almost always paired with Mega Tyranitar, a reliable sand setter, so this isn't too much of an issue. Alternatively, Mold Breaker can let Excadrill bypass Magic Bounce, letting it freely use Stealth Rock or Toxic on Mega Sableye. It's also useful for hitting Mimikyu through Disguise and Pokemon with the Levitate ability, such as Mega Latios, Rotom-W, and Hydreigon. Unfortunately, without sand support, Excadrill's speed leaves a lot to be desired—outside of the sand, Excadrill is outpaced by dangerous Pokemon such as Volcarona, Garchomp, and Mega Medicham. Excadrill additionally can struggle to break past common Flying-types like Celesteela and Landorus-T.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A specially defensive set could also be used to accentuate Excadrill's ability to check Fairy- and Electric-types like Tapu Koko, Magearna, Tapu Lele, and Magnezone. However, this variant of Excadrill is extremely slow and is thus prone to being revenge killed. It also lacks any forme of recovery, meaning that it cannot continously check Psychic- and Fairy-types.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Flying-types: Skarmory completely walls every variant of Excadrill. Other bulky Flying-types, such as Landorus-T and Celesteela, can cause serious problems for Sand Rush Excadrill. Celesteela in particular is very difficult to wear down due to its common combination of Leech Seed, Leftovers, and Protect.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types: Bulky Grass-types like Tangrowth can easily switch in on Excadrill, though they have to be careful of Corkscrew Crash on the Sand Rush set. Tapu Bulu, though it is weak to Iron Head, sets up Grassy Terrain, weakening Earthquake for several turns.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W and Slowbro can handle the Sand Rush variant of Excadrill. However, these Pokemon have to be wary of Toxic on the Focus Sash set, while Rotom-W additionally has to worry about Mold Breaker Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Priority: Super effective priority users can easily revenge kill Excadrill. Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken can OHKO Excadrill, even through Focus Sash. Azumarill and Breloom, though less common, are also able to handle Excadrill.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance in tandem with Sand Rush allows Excadrill to sweep through offensive teams and break through weakened bulky teams. Instead of Swords Dance, Stealth Rock is an option to compress multiple roles, often giving Excadrill the edge in the overall entry hazard game. Iron Head hits Pokemon that resist Earthquake like Tapu Bulu. Steelium Z turns Iron Head into a powerful Corkscrew Crash, which hits Excadrill's usual checks like Tangrowth and Landorus-T for incredible damage when boosted. Excadrill is a great offensive Rapid Spin user, as it is able to force a lot of switches. Rock Slide synergizes well with Earthquake, hitting Flying-types like Tornadus-T, Mega Pinsir, and Zapdos for super effective damage. Rapid Spin's utility is usually overall preferred, though. Giga Impact can be run with Normalium Z to overwhelm Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Pelipper, which are otherwise very solid checks to Excadrill. Do note that this does leave you with a useless move once Normalium Z has been used.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Steelium Z provides Excadrill with a 160-Base Power one-time nuke, allowing a +2 Excadrill to overwhelm bulky Pokemon like Landorus-T, Tangrowth, and Gliscor. Leftovers is an option that allows Excadrill to check the likes of Tapu Koko and Clefable more consistently, as well as keeping it out of the range of priority like Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch after taking chip damage. Air Balloon is another option that can be run if your team is weak to Ground-types. These options should mainly be considered if your team already has a Z-Crystal user. A Jolly nature allows Excadrill to outpace Choice Scarf Greninja in sand, Speed tie with opposing Excadrill, and outspeed the likes of Timid Heatran, neutral-natured Kyurem-B, and Modest Hydreigon outside of sand.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Excadrill requires sand to successfully sweep or revenge kill, so try to keep your sand setter healthy as long as possible. Attempt to give Excadrill as many turns of sand as possible before you start a sweep, as you will have a better chance of sweeping successfully. Excadrill is capable of heavily weakening the opposing team early- to mid-game and open a path to sweep, but it still requires support. Before attempting a sweep with Excadrill, make sure that its offensive answers like Mega Alakazam and Ash-Greninja are eliminated and that its defensive stops like Celesteela and Landorus-T are weakened enough. Preserve the Z-Move for a bulky threat like Tangrowth or Gliscor to immediately KO them and successfully finish a sweep. You also can use the Z-Move to punch a hole for a teammate if needed. Try to not allow Excadrill to get chipped down, as chip damage can put Excadrill in the range of priority like Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Tyranitar is the best teammate for Excadrill, as it provides sand, which is crucial for Excadrill's success. Mega Tyranitar also sets Stealth Rock, weakens Celesteela, and lures Landorus-T in order to KO it with Ice Punch or Ice Beam. Choice Band Tyranitar can also be used to soften up the opposing team for Excadrill and make a stall matchup easier, while Assault Vest Tyranitar helps check Mega Alakazam and Mega Charizard Y for Excadrill. However, both sets are usually not that optimal because Mega Tyranitar already puts pressure on the opposing team while providing additional utility. Hippowdon is another option for a sand setter, but it's generally not preferred, as it forces the team structure to be very passive. Pokemon like Tangrowth and Toxapex can take on Ash-Greninja, while Pokemon like Celesteela and Assault Vest Magearna can take on Mega Alakazam, both of which are some of Excadrill's best offensive answers. Both Greninja formes are able to beat Landorus-T and weaken Celesteela for Excadrill while setting up Spikes. Protean Greninja also can lure in Tangrowth before weakening it with Gunk Shot so Excadrill won't need to use its Z-Move on it. Clefable can heal off Excadrill's chip damage and keep the sand setter healthy with Wish. Reuniclus can check some of Excadrill's answers like Landorus-T, Celesteela, and Gliscor and use them as setup fodder. Mega Charizard Y appreciates Excadrill's Rapid Spin support, and it threatens some of Excadrill's checks like Celesteela and Tangrowth while also being able to reset sand turns.</p> "

Since Excadrill threatens every relevant Ghost-type in OU, it can function as an effective user of Rapid Spin. Earthquake is a powerful STAB move that can strike a large portion of the tier for a good chunk of damage. Rock Tomb allows Excadrill to keep Stealth Rock up against Tornadus-T. Toxic is good to use on bulky Pokemon that come in to take Earthquake, such as Tangrowth, bulky Water-types, and Landorus-T and prevents Excadrill from being setup fodder for Ground-resistant Pokemon; thanks to Mold Breaker, Excadrill can also use it on Mega Sableye.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Mold Breaker lets Excadrill set up Stealth Rock in the face of Mega Sableye. It also allows Excadrill to land Toxic on Mega Sableye, use Earthquake on Rotom-W, and hit Mimikyu through Disguise. Focus Sash is used to ensure Stealth Rock can be reliably set up. Thanks to Focus Sash, all of Excadrill's investment can go into offenses. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature is run to outspeed Timid Heatran and neutral-natured base 100s and Speed tie with other Excadrill.

Should the opponent have a hazard remover in the back not threatened by this variant of Excadrill, such as Skarmory or Tapu Fini, still set up hazards to pressure the opponent into removing them while you switch into your team's answer.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This variant of Excadrill is best suited for offensive teams. Offense staples, such as Mimikyu, Greninja, and Landorus-T, make for good partners. VoltTurn cores appreciate the entry hazard support and removal Excadrill provides. Electric-types like Tapu Koko also appreciate Excadrill's ability to cripple opposing Ground-types with Toxic. Rock-weak Pokemon like Volcarona and Charizard appreciate Excadrill's ability to remove hazards. In addition, Volcarona appreciates Stealth Rock breaking opposing Focus Sashes.

However, Scolipede's below average defenses mean Scolipede will require entry hazard removal to set up properly.

Megahorn is Scolipede's strongest attack; at +2, it is capable of OHKOing Pokemon such as Garchomp and Tapu Bulu. Aqua Tail pairs well with Megahorn, netting massive damage against Celesteela, Zapdos, and Mega Scizor when powered up by Waterium Z. Hydro Vortex, after Scolipede uses Swords Dance, also OHKOes defensive Landorus-T, one of the most common Pokemon in the tier. Earthquake rounds off Scolipede's coverage, defeating Heatran, Mega Mawile, and, more importantly, Toxapex. Spikes can be used in this slot as well to pressure switch-ins, but it is best used when Scolipede is on hyper offense teams because it will usually want to maximize its coverage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Waterium Z grants Scolipede a 175-Base Power Hydro Vortex so Scolipede can break defensive Landorus-T and take out a weakened Mega Scizor. Life Orb seems like an appealing option, but the recoil and lack of power makes it inferior. A Jolly nature and maximum Speed investment are required for Scolipede to outpace the faster Choice Scarf users in the tier such as Keldeo and Latios after a Speed Boost. The remaining EVs are invested in Attack so Scolipede can hit as hard as possible.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Scolipede's typing allows it to get a free Swords Dance against Tapu Fini and most Grass-types such as Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth, so utilize these opportunities right away. Otherwise, Scolipede will be forced to take damage in order to set up. If this is the case, prioritize removing entry hazards so Scolipede can set up in front of Mega Scizor and defensive Landorus-T and stay out of the KO range of most priority.</p> <p>If Scolipede cannot sweep, recklessly use Swords Dance and do massive damage to a check or counter shared by a teammate with a boosted Hydro Vortex. If Spikes is used on Scolipede, set up hazards and play aggressively to weaken defensive hazard removers such as Zapdos, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor with Hydro Vortex.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Stealth Rock will cause Scolipede issues, so an entry hazard remover is recommended. Mew, Mega Scizor, Latios, and Tapu Fini are solid teammates, especially since Scolipede can preserve their health by absorbing Toxic Spikes. Scolipede will have limited setup opportunities outside of against bulky Grass-types and the aforementioned Tapu Fini, so VoltTurn users that can get Scolipede free switches on these Pokemon are nice. Tapu Koko, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Manectric are prime teammates.</p> <p>Scolipede can support other physical sweepers because it breaks or wears down a lot of common answers to physical attackers such as Landorus-T. Swords Dance Mega Mawile and Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X are solid teammates because of this. Greninja, while a special attacker, is a fine team option, as Scolipede forces in and wears down Celesteela and Ferrothorn, common checks to Ash-Greninja, and gives Protean Greninja the option to forego Hidden Power Fire. Finally, Scolipede can be used on rain teams, as the rain boost to Hydro Vortex and +2 Attack creates a lot of OHKOes on Pokemon such as Zapdos, Celesteela, and Clefable.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Krookodile is a niche Choice Scarf user that works on some team structures that need the unique combination of a fast Pursuit user that blocks Volt Switch. It is also able to revenge kill sweepers reliant on Sucker Punch to sweep like Mega Mawile and Bisharp and can provide Intimidate support to soften the blow from Pokemon like Mega Tyranitar and Garchomp while also giving itself and its teammates more switch-in opportunities. Pursuit lets Krookodile checkmate threats like Mega Alakazam and Blacephalon while also taking out Pokemon like weakened Mega Latios, Mega Latias, and Reuniclus. Knock Off lets Krookodile threaten switch-ins that rely on their item like Tapu Fini, Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Tangrowth. Foul Play lets Krookodile revenge kill Swords Dance users like Garchomp, Kartana, and Landorus-T, as well as dealing more damage to Kartana than any other move. However, Foul Play should be used with Moxie due to Intimidate reducing the damage of Foul Play. Alternatively, Crunch is able to hit Mega Latias and Z-Move Reuniclus much harder than Knock Off can and lets Krookodile pressure Reuniclus that had previously taken Knock Off.</p> <p>This Krookodile set is often good on bulkier teams that need a Pursuit user that can reliably trap Mega Alakazam and Blacephalon and act as a deterrent to Swords Dance users. Skarmory is a good partner on these teams thanks to Krookodile Pursuit-trapping Blacephalon as well as checking other threats to it like Tapu Koko and Heatran. Skarmory sets Spikes, which Krookodile's switch-ins are often weak to, thus making Krookodile harder to deal with, furthered by the fact Krookodile can trap and cripple potential Defog users like Mega Latias and Tapu Fini with Pursuit and Knock Off, respectively. Chansey similarly benefits from Krookodile Pursuit-trapping Blacephalon and can counter special attackers like Greninja in return. Mega Lopunny also fits on these bulky teams and takes advantage of Krookodile trapping Mega Alakazam while also benefitting from Krookodile removing items from defensive switch-ins like Skarmory, Tapu Fini, and Landorus-T. Checks to Krookodile include Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Kartana, which can take any hit and KO. Offensive checks, like both Greninja forms, are able to take out Krookodile once they get in safely. This is especially prevalent with Ash-Greninja due to Water Shuriken making Krookodile’s Choice Scarf irrelevant. Pivoting between Dark- and Ground-type resistant Pokemon to scout what move Krookodile locks into is also a relatively safe counterplay. Finally, defensive Pokemon like Tapu Fini, Tangrowth, and even Toxapex are able to take any hit from Krookodile and hit it with super effective attacks or cripple it with status. However, they do not like getting hit with Knock Off.</p> "

  "Reuniclus": {
    "overview": "<p>Reuniclus is a unique Calm Mind user in the OU metagame that makes use of its solid typing, bulk, and access to Magic Guard and Recover to quickly overwhelm passive teams that rely on more passive Pokemon like Toxapex, Celesteela, and Tangrowth. Thanks to these traits, Reuniclus is also a really effective stall and balance breaker. In addition to this, if opted for, it can outlast Dark-types like Tyranitar and Mega Tyranitar with the combination of Acid Armor and Toxic Spikes or Spikes support, making it a versatile threat. Reuniclus also finds itself coming out on top in wars against Calm Mind users like Clefable and Magearna thanks to its access to Psyshock. While Reuniclus's bulk is solid, Reuniclus is very slow and will often have to take a hit before it can move, which can force it into rather awkward situations when attempting to set up. If Reuniclus opts to run Acid Armor, it will find itself overly reliant on Toxic Spikes and Spikes support, meaning that it has to be played very patiently before it can pull off a sweep.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Reuniclus can run a spread of 248 HP / 136 Def / 80 SpD / 44 Spe with a Bold nature and Leftovers to avoid being 2HKOed by Moonblast and Thunderbolt from Mega Diancie and Tapu Koko prior to set up, respectively.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Dark-types such as Ash-Greninja, Tyranitar, Weavile, and Hoopa-U put heavy pressure on Reuniclus, and it usually has to rely on Toxic Spikes or PP stalling them to sweep. Mega Sableye walls Reuniclus's usual set and can utilize Imprison to prevent Reuniclus from using Recover, and it only really has to watch out for variants with Energy Ball or Signal Beam. Mega Gyarados is one of the best counters to Reuniclus, as its base forme is immune to Toxic Spikes, and it sets up on Reuniclus once it's Mega Evolved. Hydreigon also deserves a special mention, as it is immune to Spikes and Toxic Spikes thanks to Levitate and is immune to Reuniclus's Psychic-type attacks as well.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Ghost-types such as Blacephalon, Gengar, and Alolan Marowak can offensively check Reuniclus, but they are susceptible to repeated attacks from Reuniclus and entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Taunt and Trick: Taunt users such as Heatran, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Fini prevent Reuniclus from using any of its status moves and can thus prevent it from sweeping. Trick users such as Victini and Hoopa-U can cripple Reuniclus.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers: Strong wallbreakers such as Mega Mawile and Kartana can overwhelm Reuniclus before it sets up.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Psyshock allows Reuniclus to win Calm Mind wars against Mega Alakazam and Clefable and lets it get past Chansey. Focus Blast allows Reuniclus to KO Dark-types like Greninja and Tyranitar as well as Steel-types such as Heatran. It also makes Reuniclus more capable of handling stall teams utilizing Mega Aggron than it would be without it. Alternatively, Energy Ball gives Reuniclus the ability to hit the aforementioned Dark-types more accurately as well as Water-types like Mega Swampert. It also lets Reuniclus hit Mega Sableye, Pyukumuku, and Quagsire, which makes it possible to break through stall teams utilizing Mega Sableye. Signal Beam hits Dark- and Psychic-types like Hoopa-U, Mega Alakazam, and opposing Reuniclus. However, because of the move’s lower Base Power, Reuniclus struggles more against bulky Dark-types like Tyranitar and Hydreigon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>44 Speed EVs allow Reuniclus to outspeed Toxapex and set up against it before it uses Haze. Rocky Helmet lets Reuniclus switch into and wear down Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny. Psychium Z gives Reuniclus a way to break past or wear down Pokemon that can ordinarily take a boosted Psyshock and potentially beat Reuniclus one-on-one like Mega Scizor, specially defensive Tapu Bulu, Tapu Fini if Reuniclus isn't running Energy Ball, and Kartana if Reuniclus is using Energy Ball. Fightinium Z with Focus Blast lets Reuniclus overcome bulky Steel- and Dark-types like Heatran, Hydreigon, both Greninja formes, and both Tyranitar formes. It's also worth noting that Focus Blast boosted by Fightinium Z never misses, making it reliable in scenarios where you can't afford to miss.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Early-game, Reuniclus should attempt to stay healthy to check Pokemon such as Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Protean Greninja. Be careful about what to set up on early-game, as Reuniclus will often be forced out, and the opposing team will still be healthy enough to check it. Try to set up entry hazards early-game to use Reuniclus to force in checks like Greninja, Tyranitar, and Heatran that are easily worn down to facilitate a late-game sweep. If Reuniclus is running Focus Blast, take advantage of the fact that it can often lure in Dark-types that think they're safe hard switching in and try to catch them on the switch. However, be sure to sufficiently wear down Tyranitar into range of Focus Blast. Reuniclus should attempt to set up on Pokemon that can’t severely threaten it like Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Chansey.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Spikes helps wear down the opposing team, which makes it easier for Reuniclus to facilitate a late-game sweep. Ferrothorn and both Greninja formes are good options for this. Pursuit support is useful in removing opposing Psychic- and Ghost-types like Mega Alakazam, Mega Latias, and Blacephalon for Reuniclus. Mega Tyranitar and Weavile are good partners for this. Despite Reuniclus having coverage for Dark-types like the Greninja and Tyranitar formes, they are still an issue in a one-on-one situation, so checks for Dark-types like Tapu Fini, Tapu Bulu, and Toxapex are needed. Magnezone works well with Reuniclus by threatening and removing Mega Scizor, which is quite troublesome for Reuniclus otherwise.</p> "

Psyshock allows Reuniclus to take on other Calm Mind sweepers such as Clefable, Magearna, and Mega Alakazam, as well as Chansey.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The given EV spread maximizes Reuniclus's physical bulk and allows it to outspeed Toxapex. Leftovers gives Reuniclus a form of passive recovery. Rocky Helmet is another option that notably allows Reuniclus to wear down Tyranitar and Mega Tyranitar by itself. Magic Guard is the preferred ability to ignore Toxic poison and similar status ailments, which sets it apart from other sweepers.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Reuniclus to check Pokemon such as Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Protean Greninja early-game. Switch Reuniclus into Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Celesteela and other passive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Tangrowth to use them as setup bait. Use Recover liberally to stay healthy throughout the match to stay out of range from critical hits and to consistently check Fighting-types. If Toxic Spikes is up on the opposing side of the field, use Reuniclus to force in a Dark-type such as Ash-Greninja, Weavile, or Tyranitar. In a situation where Weavile or Tyranitar is expected to switch in, Reuniclus should use Acid Armor so that it can set up safely after. If Toxic Spikes isn't up on the field, Reuniclus should either double switch out to a teammate that can take on these respective Dark-types or use Acid Armor to safely escape Pursuit.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Toxic Spikes or Spikes is essential whenever using Reuniclus. Toxapex is a very notable Toxic Spikes setter, as it fits on most bulky builds very well. Greninja can be used too. Toxapex also checks Ash-Greninja, which forces out Reuniclus, even after the use of Calm Mind. Reuniclus appreciates the presence of Spikes on the opposing field because it wears down usual switch-ins. Ferrothorn usually fits better on defensive teams and checks Ash-Greninja as well. Tyranitar and Weavile can Pursuit trap bulky Psychic-types that can usually trouble Reuniclus, such as Mega Latias.</p> "

  "Amoonguss": {
    "overview": "<p>With a large HP stat and a good defensive typing that allows it to handle metagame staples such as Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, Tapu Bulu, and Tangrowth, Amoonguss is a decent defensive Pokemon. Amoonguss also has five key resistances to Grass, Water, Electric, Fairy, and Fighting and access to a wide number of valuable utility moves such as Spore, Stun Spore, and Clear Smog. Amoonguss's excellent defensive ability in Regenerator only further bolsters Amoonguss's defensive prowess, as it keeps Amoonguss from having to waste time recovering, meaning it doesn't lose momentum as easily and can be a good pick on more offensively oriented teams despite not having a strong offensive presence. Unfortunately, Amoonguss' defensive typing also gives it some nasty weaknesses to common offensive types in Flying, Ice, Fire, and Psychic, and its low Speed and attacking stats can make it somewhat passive, giving setup opportunities or free switches to a vast number of offensive Pokemon once it has used Spore.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Ice can be used on a more physically defensive set to nail the likes of Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, which could otherwise use Amoonguss as setup fodder.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Flying-types: The combination of super effective STAB moves and a resistance to Grass makes Tornadus-T, Celesteela, and Mega Pinsir hard for Amoonguss to handle, but they must fear Spore.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: The likes of Tapu Lele, Mega Alakazam, Mega Latios, and Hoopa-U are able to bust through Amoonguss with their Psychic-type STAB moves, although Tapu Lele must be wary of being hit hard by Sludge Bomb.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Volcarona, Mega Charizard Y, and Heatran are just a few Fire-types that are able to beat Amoonguss with their Fire-type STAB moves, while Amoonguss can do little to retaliate outside of Spore and Stun Spore.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types: Kyurem-B, Mamoswine, and Weavile hit Amoonguss hard with their Ice-type STAB moves; however, Mamoswine can't switch directly into a Giga Drain.</p> <p><strong>Various Defensive Pokemon: Amoonguss's utility and STAB moves tend to bait in a variety of bulky Pokemon that can switch freely and proceed to either set up on Amoonguss or outlast it 1v1. This includes Pokemon such as Chansey, Mega Sableye, and Mega Venusaur. Others such as Clefable, Toxapex, Skarmory, and Celesteela can all switch in and eventually outlast Amoonguss if the right conditions are met. For example, Clefable needs Flamethrower and Amoonguss needs to have put something to sleep with Spore prior to Clefable switching in, Skarmory, Toxapex, and Celesteela all switch into Amoonguss easily after it has put something to sleep too.</p> ",

        "name": "Black Sludge",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Spore grants Amoonguss the ability to put threatening Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Mega Mawile, Mega Alakazam, and Heatran to sleep and somewhat makes up for Amoonguss's lack of offensive presence by allowing it to force out Pokemon with the threat of getting put to sleep. Hidden Power Fire allows Amoonguss to check Kartana while also preventing it from being setup fodder for Mega Mawile and Shift Gear Magearna as well as Spikes fodder for Ferrothorn. Sludge Bomb's notable poison chance and damage output makes it the preferred option over Clear Smog, but Clear Smog can still be chosen to neutralize boosting threats such as Clefable and Serperior. Stun Spore can be run instead of Sludge Bomb to still cripple threats that think they're safe after Amoonguss has put a Pokemon to sleep. It should be noted that Giga Drain can be foregone in favor of Stun Spore if Amoonguss's team already has another reliable way of beating Ash-Greninja.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>56 Defense EVs allow Amoonguss to survive a +2 Smart Strike from Kartana. The given Special Defense investment along with a Calm nature allows Amoonguss to avoid the 2HKO from Ash-Greninja's Dark Pulse and lets Amoonguss check Pokemon like Magearna and Tapu Koko more reliably. On stall teams, a more physically defensive spread can be run to check threatening stallbreakers such as Mega Mawile and Choice Band Tapu Bulu more reliably. Rocky Helmet should be used with this spread to wear these Pokemon down more steadily.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Amoonguss should be brought in safely against Pokemon that it can check, such as Ash-Greninja, Magearna, Tapu Bulu, and Clefable. From there, it should look to cripple the opposition. Thanks to Amoonguss's decent bulk and Regenerator, it can also pivot into Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Kartana to scout what move they lock themselves into. However, you should be careful when using Amoonguss to check these Pokemon, as it lacks recovery and can't reliably take on Pokemon like Choice Band Kartana and Tapu Bulu because of this. Be mindful of when to use Spore because a fodder Pokemon could come in to take it for other Pokemon such as Mega Alakazam, Heatran, and Tornadus-T, which will actively be looking to take advantage of Amoonguss. If Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Mega Alakazam, and Zapdos are predicted to switch in once another Pokemon has been put to sleep with Spore, Amoonguss should attempt to cripple them with Stun Spore, in Tornadus-T and Mega Alakzam's case, or poison them with Sludge Bomb. It's also important to actively utilize Regenerator with double switches out of Pokemon that it checks, as Amoonguss needs to be at a high range of HP to consistently check Pokemon, and this allows it to keep up the maximum amount of momentum, especially after using Spore.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Amoonguss fits on teams ranging from balance to bulky offensive to even some stall teams. While Amoonguss has enough bulk to pivot into Ash-Greninja, having a Dark-resistant Pokemon like Clefable, Assault Vest Magearna, or Tyranitar is mandatory to prevent Amoonguss from getting flinched down by Dark Pulse. Steel-types like Magearna, Celesteela, and Jirachi can check Psychic-type Pokemon like Mega Alakazam and Tapu Lele that threaten Amoonguss. Because Heatran is a massive threat to Amoonguss, Pokemon that can check it such as Garchomp and Gliscor are good teammates. Slowbro in particular is a good partner to Amoonguss, as they can form a Regenerator core while Slowbro checks Heatran, Mega Medicham, and Mega Latios. In return, Amoonguss keeps Electric-types in check and removes Toxic Spikes. Electric-types like Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Tapu Koko are capable of checking Tornadus-T, which is one of the main Pokemon that will try to actively take advantage of Amoonguss. It should be noted that Tapu Koko nullifies Spore's ability to cripple a Pokemon, so make sure to be careful when using both on the same team. Because Amoonguss has to stay at high health to consistently check Pokemon, teammates that can remove entry hazards like Tornadus-T and Rotom-W are good options.</p> "
      },
      {
        "name": "Assault Vest",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Giga Drain is Amoonguss's preferred Grass-type STAB move, as it can be used to regain HP as well as being useful against some problematic Water-types, such as Ash-Greninja, Mega Swampert, and Keldeo. Sludge Bomb is used to hit Grass- and Fairy-types such as Tapu Bulu, Tapu Koko, and Tangrowth and has a chance to cripple possible switch-ins, such as Mega Latios and Landorus-T. Clear Smog can be used over Sludge Bomb, serving as a way to neutralize threats like Calm Mind Mega Latias and Clefable, but the power and utility of Sludge Bomb is better in most cases. Also, the chosen Poison-type STAB attack is the move that activates the effect of Stomping Tantrum against Steel-types such as Heatran and Magearna. Stomping Tantrum allows Amoonguss to lure in and OHKO all Heatran and Magnezone sets after a failed move and Stealth Rock damage. It also chips at Magearna, even more so if used after the Poison-type move. Keep in mind that if you use Stomping Tantrum without activating its effect, it will be a very weak move. Hidden Power Fire makes Amoonguss into a good Kartana check, as well as giving it a way to hit Ferrothorn and prevent a favorable scenario for Mega Scizor to set up or stay against Amoonguss.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP EVs combined with 96 Defense EVs let Amoonguss always survive a +2 Kartana's Knock Off after Stealth Rock damage. The rest of the EVs are put in Special Defense along with Assault Vest to take hits from some powerful special attackers like Ash-Greninja, Choice Specs Tapu Koko, and Shift Gear Magearna. 120 Defense EVs can be used instead of the standard EV spread to have a good chance of surviving +2 Kartana's Smart Strike after Stealth Rock, but the drop of bulk on the special side can be missed. Regenerator is chosen to make Amoonguss a great pivot and sponge for special hits, regaining some HP every time it switches out. A Sassy nature is used to boost the Special Defense without losing any of the offensive stats, since both are important on this set. The drop in Speed doesn't make any difference, since Amoonguss will not outspeed anything relevant anyway.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>As this set is used to swallow some special moves, try to avoid Amoonguss taking powerful physical moves because it may miss the amount of HP lost while dealing with hits it would otherwise take, even factoring Regenerator. Also, although Amoonguss can check Ash-Greninja and lure in Heatran very well, it's recommended to scout for moves that may disrupt this set, such as Ice Beam on Ash-Greninja and Inferno Overdrive on Heatran. Preserving HP by switching out after checking the desired Pokemon is highly recommended. Leaving Amoonguss at low HP or counting only on Giga Drain for longevity can leave it unable to take special hits anymore. Regenerator is what makes this set a good pivot, so use it wisely. Amoonguss can also be used to remove Toxic Spikes from your side of the field, but keep in mind that a burn from Toxapex's Scald, for example, can be critical, putting Amoonguss in range of some attacks or, if your opponent has a Heatran, Magnezone, or Magearna, leaving it unable to deal with them properly because of the Attack reduction. When facing foes such as Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth, do not hesitate to click Sludge Bomb, even if predicting a Steel-type to come in; Stomping Tantrum is here to be used in these situations.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Amoonguss fits best alongside Pokemon that are weak to strong Water-types as well as Tapu Koko, such as Tyranitar and Mega Scizor. Pokemon that are vulnerable to Toxic Spikes like Greninja and all of the Island Guardians appreciate Amoonguss as a teammate because of its ability to absorb them. Due to the fact that Amoonguss invites in many powerful Flying-types, means of checking Mega Pinsir, Hawlucha, and Tornadus-T, such as Celesteela and Tapu Koko, make great partners for Amoonguss. Physically defensive pivots like Landorus-T and Mega Scizor are also good options as partners, since they can cover the physical attackers that this set is weaker to.</p> "

Alomomola can find several opportunities to Wish pass during a game thanks to its good physical bulk. On the downside, Alomomola's low base 40 Special Attack means that it is very passive and thus heavily reliant on Scald burns or utility moves such as Toxic and Knock Off. It offers very little to a team outside of Wish passing due to its low offenses, lack of useful resistances, and its bad Special Defense, which makes it mostly outclassed by Chansey as a Wish passer.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Toxic is used to punish Pokemon such as Mega Charizard X, Mega Slowbro, and Tapu Bulu that may otherwise try to use Alomomola as setup fodder. Toxic also pressures defensive Pokemon that would otherwise be able to sit in against Alomomola and waste its PP. Knock Off is an option to remove items from Pokemon such as Tapu Fini, Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Tapu Bulu. Wish is Alomomola's means of recovery, which it can use to heal both itself and its teammates. Protect enables Alomomola to stall out a turn, gaining an additional turn of Leftovers recovery, getting potential Toxic damage on a foe, and even receiving its own Wish if necessary.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Since Alomomola's base HP is already so high, it better maximizes its bulk by investing heavily in both defensive stats. There are few Pokemon that will not be healed back to 100% as a recipient of Alomomola's Wish even without it investing into HP, so there is little reason to do so heavily. Therefore, only 40 HP EVs are used, maximizing Leftovers recovery, while 216 Defense EVs combined with a Bold nature hit a jump point in Defense. Maximum Special Defense investment allows Alomomola to stomach hits from Pokemon such as non-transformed Choice Specs Greninja. Leftovers grants Alomomola additional passive recovery, allowing it to more reliably handle threats such as Garchomp and Mamoswine. Rocky Helmet can be used in place of Leftovers to chip away at physical attackers, especially U-turn users such as Mega Scizor and Landorus-T; however, the passive recovery provided by Leftovers generally grants better defensive utility in a wider range of situations. Regenerator is what makes Alomomola such a defensive threat, healing a third of its health just for switching out, as well as an excellent Wish passer.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Once Alomomola has been brought in, it is usually best to try and throw out either a Knock Off or a Toxic to cripple the opponent's initial switch-in. Alomomola is a relatively safe Pokemon to use when scouting offensive threats such as Greninja and Keldeo for coverage moves thanks to its great bulk combined with Regenerator, so don't be afraid to switch it in during situations such as this. Lastly, keep in mind that Alomomola needs to be at a relatively high amount of HP in order to reliably wall many of the more powerful wallbreakers in OU, so try not to let it get too weak; sometimes, it is best for Alomomola to receive its own Wish, rather than passing it, so that it can remain healthy.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Heatran and Alomomola create a good defensive core, with Heatran being able to check a number of the common Pokemon that can give Alomomola trouble such as Grass-types, Mega Charizard Y, and Swords Dance Mega Mawile. In return, Alomomola keeps Heatran healthy with Wish, negating Heatran's lack of a recovery move. Physically defensive Landorus-T can be used to check physical setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Landorus, Excadrill, and Garchomp that may otherwise overwhelm Alomomola. Unaware Clefable deals with setup Pokemon such as Tail Glow Manaphy and Swords Dance Garchomp. Wallbreakers such as Kyurem-B, Mega Mawile, and Tapu Lele all appreciate being kept healthy via Alomomola's Wish, giving them greater staying power. Alomomola is also able to threaten most Steel-types with Knock Off and Scald burns.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Ferrothorn is a premier hazard setter in the OU tier, as it has access to both Spikes and Stealth Rock. They are very important in pressuring opposing teams as they switch Pokemon, which is why Ferrothorn is so successful. Ferrothorn can also annoy other teams with moves like Leech Seed and Knock Off, which whittle or cripple opposing Pokemon. Thanks to solid defenses and an excellent Grass / Steel typing that provides plenty of resistances, it finds many opportunities to set up entry hazards or fire off moves to annoy the opposing team. Ferrothorn is naturally a good check to Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Kingdra, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Swampert, though it is easily worn down by the latter two. While Ferrothorn is a very good Pokemon, it is extremely slow, which hampers its offensive presence, since it will practically always be outsped. Fortunately, it has high-Base Power STAB moves, so it is not completely passive. Ferrothorn is also 4x weak to Fire, so it should be wary of Hidden Power Fire from Pokemon like Greninja, and it is easily forced out by Heatran and other Fire-types.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rocky Helmet can be run on more physically defensive spreads to punish physical attackers such as Mega Mawile and Tapu Bulu. An Iapapa Berry can be run instead of Leftovers on fast-paced teams, which generally gain more from the burst recovery than the passive recovery from Leftovers, as Ferrothorn won't be wanting to stay in as much to make the most use of it. Hidden Power Fire can be used to deal with Kartana, which Ferrothorn is otherwise setup fodder for, though it is useless outside of this application. Bulldoze can be run on teams that are weak to Heatran and Magnezone, but Ferrothorn can't afford to fit it very often. Toxic is an interesting option to punish Pokemon like Zapdos, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Charizard Y that don't mind anything else Ferrothorn can dish out.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Heatran, Volcarona, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Charizard Y are extremely threatening to Ferrothorn, as they OHKO it with their STAB moves. The special attackers in particular don't mind Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types with Fire-type Coverage: Zapdos is one of the best counters to Ferrothorn, as it takes pitiful damage from all of Ferrothorn's attacks, can remove any entry hazards, and threatens to do massive damage if it carries Heat Wave. Magnezone is also a large threat to Ferrothorn, as it can trap it with Magnet Pull and 2HKO it. Mega Manectric carries Fire-type coverage in the form of Flamethrower or Overheat.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye: Mega Sableye prevents Ferrothorn from setting up hazards and can take any combination of attacks from it, not even being annoyed by Knock Off or Leech Seed. It should be noted that Impish Ferrothorn does Speed tie with Mega Sableye and can threaten to 2HKO a weakened Mega Sableye on the switch. However, Ferrothorn is generally dead weight in matchups against Mega Sableye.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Mega Venusaur and Amoonguss primarily counter Ferrothorn, as they take very little damage from its attacks and threaten to beat it down with Hidden Power Fire. Mega Venusaur in particular does not mind Knock Off. Tangrowth is an okay check, as it is unaffected by Leech Seed, but it fears losing its item, particularly if it is an Assault Vest variant.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Mega Medicham is very threatening to Ferrothorn not carrying Protect, as High Jump Kick is a clean OHKO. Other Fighting-types such as Terrakion and Keldeo can also threaten Ferrothorn, but they fail to OHKO it unless they are holding a boosting item such as Choice Band or Choice Specs, respectively. Mega Gallade can potentially set up a Swords Dance against Ferrothorn or OHKO with Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers: Various wallbreakers such as Swords Dance Landorus-T, Mega Mawile, Protean Greninja, Garchomp, and Kyurem-B can overwhelm Ferrothorn with coverage or sheer power.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Spikes can be extremely useful for pressuring grounded foes, though Stealth Rock can be run instead of Spikes if Ferrothorn's team can't afford to fit the move anywhere else. Leech Seed provides Ferrothorn with a way to restore HP and is particularly helpful for wearing down Pokemon such as Heatran. Gyro Ball allows Ferrothorn to handle fast Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Tapu Lele; alternatively, Thunder Wave lets it cripple them. Knock Off can be used to remove items of common switch-ins such as Heatran, Tangrowth, and Celesteela, which limits their effectiveness. Power Whip is the main STAB move due to its ability to OHKO Ash-Greninja and deal large amounts of damage to Tapu Fini and Manaphy. Protect can be used to stall turns and gain extra recovery—which is great with Leech Seed—as well as scout for coverage moves. This is also very helpful against Mega Medicham's High Jump Kick. Both Stealth Rock and Spikes can be used on the same set, but that forces Ferrothorn to give up one of its other useful utility or attacking moves. Ferrothorn is fairly versatile and can handle many different threats between its options. As such, you should be mindful when considering what moves to run on Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP in tandem with 232 Special Defense EVs and a Sassy nature ensure that Choice Specs Greninja's Dark Pulse does not 3HKO at full HP. The leftover EVs are put into Defense to ensure that Ferrothorn can take a +1 Supersonic Skystrike from Gyarados if at full HP. If running anything other than Gyro Ball, Careful is the preferred nature. If Hidden Power Fire is used, Ferrothorn needs a Sassy nature and 8 Special Attack EVs to ensure that it OHKOes Kartana. A more physically defensive spread of 252 HP / 88 Def / 168 SpD with an Impish nature allows Ferrothorn to better take on physical attackers such as offensive Landorus-T. Chople Berry is an alternative item that allows Ferrothorn to take a powerful Fighting-type move from Pokemon such as Mega Medicham, Mega Alakazam, Tapu Lele, and Gengar. Chople Berry should be used with Thunder Wave, as it allows Ferrothorn to cripple these faster threats after surviving the hit, making it easier for the rest of your team to deal with them. Gyro Ball is also an option instead of Thunder Wave to check Pokemon like Tapu Bulu, Tapu Lele, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Alakazam.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Switch in Ferrothorn on favorable circumstances, like when against weaker Pokemon such as Toxapex or Pokemon that it walls such as Tapu Koko. Use the early turns with Ferrothorn to set up entry hazards, because this pressures the opponent's entire team and in some cases forces in hazard removers. Leech Seed and Knock Off should be used to whittle down threats as they switch in, particularly if you predict big threats to switch in or if Ferrothorn has already set up hazards. Leech Seed should also be used to keep Ferrothorn healthy throughout the match so that it can stick around to check various threats or set up entry hazards again if they get removed. Generally, it is best not to sacrifice Ferrothorn until the opposing hazard remover has been weakened, if one's present at all.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Landorus-T and Heatran can set up Stealth Rock, allowing Ferrothorn the freedom to run Spikes. Landorus and Ferrothorn together check a large amount of the metagame as well thanks to their solid type synergy. Greninja can defeat common entry hazard removers such as Zapdos and Mega Scizor, and provides a lot of offensive presence to complement Ferrothorn's more passive nature. Ash-Greninja and Keldeo are also good with Ferrothorn, as they threaten Fire-types. Garchomp is also strong against many Fire-types and appreciates the hazards Ferrothorn sets up, as they wear down many of its common checks. Ferrothorn can support its teammates by removing items like Assault Vest from Tangrowth and Leftovers from Tapu Fini that are forced to use Defog. Fast pivots like Tapu Koko and Tornadus-T provide speed control and momentum while taking advantage of the hazards that Ferrothorn sets up by forcing switches. Rotom-W relieves pressure from Ferrothorn by being an extra check to Pokemon such as Greninja and Landorus-T while providing utility in Volt Switch. Fast wallbreakers such as Gengar and Swords Dance Garchomp appreciate having Spikes up to wear down the opposing team and provide offensive firepower that makes up for Ferrothorn's mediocre offensive presence.</p> "

  "Bisharp": {
    "overview": "<p>Bisharp's combination of two strong STAB moves, a powerful priority move, and the means to boost its Attack makes it a threatening physical attacker in the OU tier. Dark is one of the most devastating offensive typings in the game, which allows Bisharp to pose a big threat to defensive teams with its powerful Knock Off. In addition to this, Swords Dance + Sucker Punch gives Bisharp a powerful cleaning tool that enables it to also be a pretty threatening Pokemon for offensive teams under the right circumstances. Bisharp's Defiant ability bolsters its sweeping capabilities, gaining an Attack boost any time one of its stats is lowered. Its Dark / Steel typing is also somewhat decent, giving Bisharp resistances to common offensive types such as Dragon, Ice, Flying, and Ghost. On the flip side, Bisharp's relatively low base 70 Speed leaves it outsped by the majority of the offensive metagame, making it heavily reliant on Sucker Punch, a move that can be circumvented if the foe does not use an attacking move. Bisharp is also relatively frail, unable to take most moderately strong attacks if it does not resist them. Also, while Bisharp may only have three weaknesses, they are three of the most common typings in the tier: Fire, Ground, and Fighting.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Life Orb can be used to give all of Bisharp's attacks an additional boost, but it comes at the cost of much-reduced staying power. Life Orb recoil will wear away at Bisharp and can end up putting it into range of priority moves or weaker attacks that it would have otherwise been able to survive. Lum Berry enables Bisharp to heal itself of any major status condition, allowing it to play more aggressively when facing Pokemon such as Rotom-W, Mega Sableye, Amoonguss, and Slowbro that could all otherwise cripple it with status moves or Scald. Shuca Berry gives Bisharp the ability to take a Ground-type attack from common checks such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, which it can then threaten with either Knock Off or Swords Dance-boosted Sucker Punch. Low Kick can be used to nail Pokemon such as Heatran, Greninja, and Mega Gyarados. Lastly, Pursuit can be used in place of Swords Dance, granting Bisharp the ability to situationally Pursuit trap Pokemon such as Tapu Lele, Mega Latios, Chansey, and Alakazam.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: With a resistance to both Knock Off and Sucker Punch, Keldeo, Terrakion, and Mega Heracross are all able to effectively check Bisharp and OHKO it with their powerful STAB moves. Keldeo is a particularly good example, as it also resists Bisharp's Iron Head.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Physical walls such as Zapdos, Tangrowth, and Hippowdon are all able to stomach hits from Bisharp and can aptly deal with it. Zapdos and Hippowdon threaten to KO Bisharp with Heat Wave and Earthquake, respectively, while Tangrowth threatens to put Bisharp to sleep with Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Dark-type Pokemon such as Ash-Greninja and Mega Gyarados take advantage of their resistance to Sucker Punch to check Bisharp, with Mega Gyarados even being able to use it as setup fodder.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Knock Off is Bisharp's main STAB move, boasting good power combined with the ability to remove the affected Pokemon's item. Iron Head is Bisharp's secondary STAB move, hitting Fairy-types that resist Dark hard while also being a good move to use if a Pokemon has already had its item removed or cannot have its item removed. Sucker Punch gives Bisharp a means of priority, which allows it to somewhat cover for its relatively low Speed stat for an offensive Pokemon, enabling it to pick off frailer offensive threats and dealing significant damage at +2. Swords Dance boosts Bisharp's Attack and turns it into a fearsome offensive sweeper that is able to threaten some of the bulkiest defensive walls. Black Hole Eclipse gives Bisharp a strong 140-Base Power Dark-type Z-Move that OHKOes many defensive Pokemon at +2.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack investment enables Bisharp to hit as hard and as fast as possible, which are two important traits for a physical attacker. An Adamant nature is preferred to OHKO Pokemon such as Mega Sableye, Celesteela, Toxapex, and Mega Scizor with +2 Black Hole Eclipse if choosing to run Darkinium Z, although Stealth Rock damage is also required in the case of latter three. A Jolly nature is an option to outspeed Pokemon such as Adamant Tapu Bulu and Mega Heracross, although the additional wallbreaking power provided by an Adamant nature is generally the superior option. Bisharp is commonly used on teams that already carry a Z-Move user, so a Black Glasses is best all around option, boosting both of its Dark-type moves without any drawbacks. Darkinium Z is the best option otherwise. Defiant is Bisharp's ability of choice, enabling it to attain a +2 Attack boost whenever any of its other stats drop, such as against a Pokemon using Defog or Intimidate users entering the field.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>One of the first things to note is that if one is using Darkinium Z Bisharp, Sucker Punch has a higher 70 Base Power compared to Knock Off's 65, meaning that using Sucker Punch as the Z-Move will give Dark Hole Eclipse a higher Base Power. It is also worth noting that Z-Moves have neutral priority by default, so using Sucker Punch as the base of the Z-Move will not cause the attack to have +1 priority; it will be neutral priority. Bisharp is used either as an early- and mid-game wallbreaker or as a late-game cleaner. As a wallbreaker, Bisharp can pave the way for another sweeper by using Knock Off or Black Hole Eclipse to weaken or KO a threatening defensive Pokemon. However, sometimes all that is needed is for Bisharp to use Sucker Punch to weaken an offensive threat so that it can then be revenge killed by a teammate. As a late-game cleaner, Bisharp will most likely utilize the combination of Swords Dance and Sucker Punch to sweep through a weakened team. Keep in mind that Bisharp's excellent Defiant ability means that it has the capacity to become a massive threat at any turn, as it gains an Attack boost if any of its stats are lowered. This will often cause Defog users to think twice before removing entry hazards, and Intimidate users such as Landorus-T and Gyarados also have to play carefully around Bisharp, as if they don't, things can get out of hand quickly.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Hazard stacking offensive teams, usually those that use Sticky Web or Spikes in particular, are the types of offensive teams that Bisharp fits best on. Its Defiant ability makes it a good deterrent to Defog, and Bisharp's middling Speed tier means that it often appreciates Sticky Web support in order to outspeed faster offensive threats. With that in mind, Pokemon such as Ribombee, Araquanid, and Greninja are good partners for Bisharp, as they all fit well on these archetypes and are adept at setting up hazards. Bisharp generally pairs well with most physical attackers, as Pokemon such as Mega Pinsir and Mega Medicham  can work to overwhelm bulkier physically defensive Pokemon that Bisharp would not be able to overcome alone. Lastly, since Bisharp is forced out by almost all Fighting-type Pokemon, it is often a good idea to pair Bisharp with other offensive Pokemon such as Mega Alakazam and Tornadus-T that are able to check threats such as Keldeo and Mega Heracross.</p> "

  "Hydreigon": {
    "overview": "<p>Hydreigon is a decently powerful wallbreaker in the tier due to a solid Special Attack stat, a good STAB move in Dark Pulse, and great coverage options like Flash Cannon and Earth Power. Despite being a primarily offensive Pokemon, decent bulk, reliable recovery in Roost, and a unique typing allow it to check a number of Pokemon such as Heatran, Ash-Greninja before transformation, Reuniclus, and Blacephalon. Hydreigon's Speed tier, while good enough to outspeed Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Kyurem-B, unfortunately narrowly misses out on base 100s. Hydreigon is also aided by its useful ability Levitate, granting it an immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, meaning it doesn't have to use Roost as much as other Pokemon and making it a more reliable switch-in to Pokemon that pair well with these entry hazards such as Reuniclus. However, Hydreigon lacks the immediate power and Speed of other offensive wallbreakers and pivots in the tier like Ash-Greninja and Mega Latios. Additionally, it can be hard to justify the use of Hydreigon on a lot of teams because of how specific its niche in the tier is.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hydreigon has an expansive movepool containing a number of solid moves including Fire Blast, U-turn, and Defog, but it is difficult to fit such moves onto the set without making it less effective. Hydreigon is an effective user of Choice Specs due to its solid Special Attack stat and decent Speed tier; however, no Roost causes it to be worn down much more easily, resulting in it checking things less effectively.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey takes practically no damage from any of Hydreigon's moves and can freely get up Stealth Rock or poison it with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types that either are faster than Hydreigon or can take one of its coverage moves such as Clefable, Tapu Bulu, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Fini pose huge threats to Hydreigon, as they can threaten it with their Fairy-type STAB moves or, in Tapu Bulu's case, Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Steel-types: While Hydreigon does carry Earth Power for Steel-types, some take very little damage from it or are immune to it, namely Ferrothorn, Assault Vest Magearna, and Celesteela, although they are prone to being worn down over time.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Due to the lack of Draco Meteor, Fighting-types such as Mega Lopunny, Hawlucha, and Keldeo can come in without taking much damage and OHKO Hydreigon with their Fighting-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Water-types with solid special bulk such as Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Mantine can easily take any of Hydreigon's moves and threaten it with Toxic or a Scald burn.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Pokemon that are faster than Hydreigon such as Mega Alakazam, Kartana, and Weavile can threaten to OHKO Hydreigon with their super effective moves.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dark Pulse is Hydreigon's mandatory STAB move, packing a decent Base Power and 100% accuracy. Earth Power allows Hydreigon to deal heavy damage to Steel-types such as Heatran, Magearna, and Magnezone while also hitting Tyranitar. Flash Cannon punishes Fairy-types that try to switch into Hydreigon, namely Clefable and Tapu Bulu. Roost improves Hydreigon's longevity when it is needed to check certain Pokemon such as Heatran and Ash-Greninja. Taunt can be run instead of Earth Power to pressure bulkier teams better, but notably gives up the ability to hit Magearna for super effective damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>32 Special Defense EVs ensure Hydreigon isn't 2HKOed by Battle Bond Greninja's Hydro Pump after Stealth Rock. 232 Speed EVs in tandem with a Timid nature allow Hydreigon to outspeed base 95s, and the rest is dumped into Special Attack in order to keep Hydreigon's offensive presence intact. A Modest nature can be used instead if the extra damage dealt to Clefable and Tapu Bulu is deemed necessary, but the inability to outspeed Pokemon such as Z-Move Landorus-T, Tapu Lele, Kyurem-B, and Excadrill can be disappointing. Darkinium Z powers Dark Pulse up to a 160-Base Power Black Hole Eclipse, granting Hydreigon the ability to deal heavy damage to checks, including Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor. Levitate is Hydreigon's only ability, but it is nonetheless a good one, giving it an immunity to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and most Ground moves, although it should be noted that Hydreigon is a poor switch-in to the majority of Ground-types.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Hydreigon can be used to check a number of Pokemon such as Heatran, Battle Bond Greninja, and Reuniclus due to its bulk and two immunities. However, you should be wary of switching it into Heatran and Greninja without knowing their sets, as Heatran can potentially OHKO Hydreigon with Corkscrew Crash or annoy it with Toxic, and Greninja can carry Ice Beam on Battle Bond sets or can be Protean, which Hydreigon fails to check at all. Also, if Hydreigon is needed to check something, you should make sure to keep it healthy with Roost so it can continue to do so throughout the match. Since Hydreigon is known to be a utilizer of both Choice Specs and Choice Scarf, it is reasonable for the opponent to suspect that Hydreigon could be using one of these items, so it can be valuable to bluff these sets to surprise Pokemon that could otherwise beat this set if it were locked into a move. If facing a Clefable or specially defensive Tapu Bulu, it is essential to attempt to predict them to switch in and hit them with a Flash Cannon, as otherwise Hydreigon is forced out by Moonblast or Superpower.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set can be used on offensive and balanced teams alike due to its reliability and ability to check dangerous Pokemon for such archetypes. Steel-types like Heatran and Celesteela are welcome teammates, as they have solid type synergy with Hydreigon, providing it a switch-in to Fairy and Ice-type moves that it would otherwise fold to. Similarly, Fairy-types and bulky Psychic-types including Clefable, Reuniclus, Mew, and Mega Slowbro are decent partners, as they can beat Fighting-types such as Mega Medicham and Hawlucha that tear through Hydreigon. Stealth Rock and especially Spikes setters such as Clefable, Ferrothorn, and Greninja help to wear down Hydreigon's checks. Pokemon that enjoy Fairy-types being weakened like Hawlucha, Mega Medicham, and Mega Lopunny are good partners, since Hydreigon can deal heavy damage to said Fairy-types with Flash Cannon. Tornadus-T is an exemplary teammate, as it can annoy Hydreigon checks such as Clefable, Toxapex, and Assault Vest Magearna with Knock Off and chip damage from U-turn, and it additionally forces in Heatran, which Hydreigon can take advantage of. Likewise, Tapu Bulu, Ferrothorn, and other Grass-types lure in Pokemon that Hydreigon can use to get free turns out of, like the aforementioned Heatran, Tangrowth, and Zapdos, while also wearing down Steel-types that check Hydreigon with repeated use of Leech Seed and boosted Superpowers.</p> "

Its large movepool, which is complemented by Z-Moves, allows Volcarona to pick its checks and counters. Volcarona also has a ton of setup opportunities in a tier infested with Steel-types and passive Pokemon such as Tangrowth. However, Volcarona is held back by its 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, requiring Defog or Rapid Spin support. Volcarona will also lose to a common Pokemon depending on its set, meaning it can be inconsistent.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Flamethrower is used over Fiery Dance for the extra PP, because of the long games this set will usually force. It's also chosen over Fire Blast because the consistency is preferred over the higher power. Bug Buzz in conjunction with Buginium Z and boosts from Quiver Dance gives Volcarona a way to break through Fire-resistant Pokemon like Tyranitar and Garchomp. Roost allows Volcarona to stay healthy so it can continue to check Mega Mawile and Kartana and continue to set up on Pokemon like Mega Alakazam and Mega Latios.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>148 Speed EVs with a Timid nature mean Volcarona can outspeed Adamant Mega Medicham. The remaining EVs are put into bulk, enabling Volcarona to better check Mega Mawile, Mega Scizor, and Kartana.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It is paramount to Volcarona's success that entry hazards, particularly Stealth Rock, be cleared before sending it out because of its vulnerability to them and 4x weakness to Stealth Rock. If hazards are off Volcarona's side of the field, it's perfectly fine to throw off attacks with Volcarona multiple times throughout the game in order to wear down Pokemon like Heatran lacking Leftovers. You should still prioritize weakening Pokemon like Heatran and Toxapex with your other teammates as well, though, as without support, Volcarona will find it very difficult to do so. Unlike offensive variants, this set can be used liberally to check Pokemon like Tapu Bulu, Mega Mawile, and Mega Scizor, potentially even crippling them with a burn from Flame Body. Roost should be used frequently to keep Volcarona healthy enough to check the aforementioned threats. Avoid status at all costs, particularly Toxic, as it drastically decreases Volcarona's efficacy.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Bulky Volcarona can be used on a multitude of teams thanks to its offensive potency combined with its ability to check problematic Pokemon like Tapu Bulu, Mega Mawile, and Kartana. Entry hazard removers are essential for Volcarona teams—it's not uncommon for two hazard removers to be utilized on Volcarona teams, so Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Koko are great partners. Mega Sableye in particular is useful due to Magic Bounce, making hazard setters think twice, and its access to Knock Off and Will-O-Wisp to wear down Pokemon like Heatran, Toxapex, and Gastrodon. Since Volcarona is hopelessly walled by Heatran and Toxapex, ways to circumvent them are necessary: Pokemon that take advantage of Volcarona's counters like Mega Alakazam and Mega Medicham are good options, as Volcarona will give them several opportunities to come in. Similarly, lures for them like Thunder Punch + Focus Punch or Brick Break Mega Mawile and Choice Specs Tapu Lele are useful. Ways to chip down the two are also appreciated, be it by removing their passive recovery with Knock Off from Ferrothorn, overloading its checks with Pokemon like Calm Mind Reuniclus and offensive Magearna, or by stacking your own hazards with Heatran, Ferrothorn, or Ash-Greninja. Pokemon utilizing a Choice Scarf such as Landorus-T, Greninja, and Victini can outspeed Volcarona even after a Quiver Dance and dish out heavy damage to it, so measures for these Pokemon should be considered. Tapu Fini is a great partner, as it can lure Toxapex and remove it with Whirlpool or weaken it with Taunt + Nature's Madness, pivot into Heatran, and if needed utilize Defog to keep hazards off the field.</p> "

When combined with Buginium Z, it becomes Savage Spin-Out, which can be used to muscle past Pokemon such as Garchomp on the switch. Hidden Power Ground rounds off the set to let Volcarona break past Heatran, a Pokemon that many teams prefer not to let switch in freely. Psychic is an option with Psychium Z to break Toxapex and hit Choice Scarf Keldeo on the switch instead. Giga Drain is an option over Bug Buzz or Psychic to hit Gastrodon and Tapu Fini and recover health. This is best used with an alternative item such as Firium Z or Charti Berry.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Flame Body is the preferred ability for its burn chance in clutch moments. Buginium Z should be used with Bug Buzz to access Savage Spin-Out, while Psychium Z is the item choice for sets running Psychic, granting access to Shattered Psyche. If Giga Drain is used, however, Firium Z should be the item of choice—Inferno Overdrive is capable of OHKOing Naive Diancie and Mega Charizard Y at +1 and has insane power in general, allowing Volcarona to surprise and OHKO Landorus-T, Tapu Lele, and Kyurem-B without a boost.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Volcarona should not set up until its counters are cleared. Volcarona's matchup does fluctuate, so there are moments where it can set up mid-game and go for a sweep right off the bat. A lot of Pokemon are setup bait to Volcarona, but those Pokemon can often annoy Volcarona back. Celesteela can use Leech Seed on it and switch around until Volcarona is in range of priority. Ferrothorn can do the same or cripple Volcarona with Thunder Wave. These are the types of situations where directly attacking is usually more safe and beneficial than using Quiver Dance.</p> <p>Volcarona should only come in when entry hazards are off the field, since they greatly cripple it. Volcarona should keep as much of its health to be out of range of priority attacks and set up comfortably. Because of this, the best way to bring it in is through VoltTurn support, double switches, or after sacrificing a Pokemon. Similarly, do not make reckless plays in trying to take advantage of Flame Body. Potentially burning a Mega Scizor is not worth taking U-turn damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard removal is mandatory. Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Tapu Fini are solid options on more defensive teams, while Excadrill and Kartana are options on more hyper offensive teams. Mega Diancie can also discourage hazards from going up and can use Stealth Rock itself, meaning Volcarona can take advantage of Stealth Rock on the opponent's side of the field. Depending on Volcarona's set, it will be walled by certain Pokemon, so lures to such threats are nice. Buginium Z sets lose to Toxapex, so Thunder Punch Mega Mawile and Extrasensory Greninja can pressure it. Psychium Z Volcarona sets need a way to weaken Tyranitar, so Mega Latios is a phenomenal teammate, since it can pressure it with Earthquake. Tyranitar itself is an interesting teammate too, since it traps Mega Latios and Mega Latias for Psychium Z Volcarona and can support a potential Rapid Spin Excadrill as another teammate. Pokemon that can switch into common attackers that force out Volcarona like Ash-Greninja are required. Tangrowth and Toxapex can do this reliably.</p> "

  "Terrakion": {
    "overview": "<p>Terrakion has a great Speed tier that allows it to perform as a decent offensive Stealth Rocker. It possesses a near-unresisted STAB combination, which allows Terrakion to serve as a strong wallbreaker and cleaner for offensive teams. On the downside, however, its typing also leaves it weak to Ground-, Water-, and Grass-type moves used by Landorus-T, Greninja, and Tangrowth, which are all common in the OU tier; this also means that it can be easily revenge killed by Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken. In addition, it also faces competition as a wallbreaker and entry hazard setter from other threats, such as Landorus-T.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Stealth Rock entry hazard lead set with Focus Sash is a usable option due to its strong STAB moves allowing it to match up well against a number of entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn while also making use of Taunt to deter Defog users. However, this set has a bad matchup against some hazard leads such as Azelf, and Ash-Greninja is able to take advantage of lead Terrakion by transforming after taking it out. Double Kick can be used on this set specifically to beat Smeargle, preventing it from setting up Sticky Web or Stealth Rock. A Choice Band set allows Terrakion to work as a powerful wallbreaker by taking advantage of the lack of Pokemon that resist its STAB coverage and of its great Speed tier to revenge kill. Most notably, it can threaten normal checks such as Mega Mawile with a Choice Band-boosted Earthquake. Hidden Power Ice may be used with a Life Orb to avoid recoil and wear down Landorus-T and Garchomp, although this option forces it to cut some of its bulk in order to power Hidden Power Ice up, leaving it at the mercy of Battle Bond Greninja and its Choice Specs-boosted Water Shuriken when unboosted.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Hippowdon all resist Terrakion's Rock-type STAB moves and can threaten it with their Ground-type STAB moves. Landorus-T also cuts Terrakion's Attack with Intimidate, severely limiting its damage output. All except for Landorus-T must watch out for Close Combat if significantly weakened, and they do not appreciate getting hit with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Keldeo, Toxapex, Greninja, Ash-Greninja, and other bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini all take advantage of Terrakion due to their great natural bulk. Keldeo can take easily take out Terrakion with a Water-type STAB move, and Toxapex can easily take a hit from all of Terrakion's moves.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Tangrowth and Mega Venusaur can take most of Terrakion's attacks and respond with a strong super effective Grass-type STAB move. Tangrowth can get worn down with Toxic, while Mega Venusaur does not have the ability to consistently switch into Terrakion due to its lack of Regenerator. Tapu Bulu is a notable mention, as it is able to take advantage of most hits from the Choice Scarf set, although it must watch out for either Continental Crush or a Choice Band-boosted Stone Edge.</p> <p><strong>Priority: Super effective priority such as Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken, Mega Medicham's Bullet Punch, Mega Scizor's Bullet Punch, and the rare Breloom's Mach Punch are able to pick off a weakened Terrakion and stop any sweep cold in its tracks.</p> ",

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance allows Terrakion to serve as a bigger threat against many defensive builds that lack faster answers to it, allowing it to wallbreak with ease. Stone Edge is notable for having a large lack of resistant Pokemon in the OU metagame. With Rockium Z, it turns into a strong 180-Base Power Continental Crush, picking up notable OHKOs at +2 on physically defensive Pokemon, such as Tangrowth and Landorus-T, after Stealth Rock damage and an Intimidate drop in the case of Landorus-T, as well as Mega Venusaur and Toxapex. Close Combat is Terrakion's secondary Fighting-type STAB move, which allows it to hit the Steel- and Ground-type Pokemon that resist Stone Edge such as Garchomp and Ferrothorn. Stealth Rock lets Terrakion support the rest of its team by providing residual damage for teammates to take advantage of, and it works well on this set because, after a Swords Dance boost, Terrakion can take advantage of many common entry hazard removers such as Zapdos and Tapu Fini.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack investment with a Jolly nature allows Terrakion to hit as hard as possible while outspeeding threats such as Garchomp, Mega Pinsir, Manaphy, and Landorus-T. The choice between Rockium Z and Life Orb on this set depends on the team; if a more useful Z-Move user is not present on the team, then Rockium Z can be used to turn Stone Edge into a powerful Continental Crush, which can dent even Pokemon that resist it very hard. However, Life Orb is a very useful item that can power up Terrakion's moves at the cost of its health, making it easier to be taken out by the likes of pre-transformation Battle Bond Greninja's Water Shuriken.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set serves mainly as an early-game wallbreaker, using its great Speed tier to threaten defensive threats such as Celesteela, Landorus-T, and Ferrothorn after a Swords Dance boost using Continental Crush. Bringing Terrakion in with the assistance of Volt Switch and U-turn or double switches is a great way of keeping it healthy so that it does not fall to priority moves such as +2 Bisharp's Sucker Punch later on in the match. When using this set, Stone Edge is the safer move to use due to its lack of resistant Pokemon in the metagame, but you can predict threats that resist Rock-type moves such as Scarf Excadrill to come in by hitting them with Close Combat on the switch. Use Swords Dance on a predicted switch into a defensive threat, such as Landorus-T, and take it out with a Continental Crush, although you should be wary for opponents that try to scout for the Z-Move. The way this set is used depends on the last slot; if using Stealth Rock, it is wise to set it up against threats that Terrakion normally forces out such as Ferrothorn or Heatran.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Wallbreakers such as Garchomp and Mega Mawile that appreciate Stealth Rock support or appreciate Terrakion's ability to wear down and take out the likes of Celesteela, Tangrowth, and Landorus-T pair well with this Terrakion set. These wallbreakers can even wear down threats to prepare for a late-game Terrakion sweep. Partners that can take on faster offensive checks to Terrakion like Greninja, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Koko pair well with this set; such partners include Tapu Koko and Choice Scarf Keldeo, for example. Terrakion can find itself hindered by its weaknesses to Water-type moves from threats such as Ash-Greninja, which can deter Terrakion from setting up with Hydro Pump. Partners such as Assault Vest Tangrowth can assist in taking these threats on and therefore perform well with Terrakion. Given that this set can severely weaken or take out Landorus-T, a teammate that appreciates this such as Swords Dance Mega Mawile or Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X can easily find more opportunities to set up and sweep.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stone Edge is Terrakion's strongest STAB Rock-type move and is mainly used to revenge kill threats that are not OHKOed by Rock Slide, such as Mega Charizard X and Gyarados, as well as Gengar and Mega Alakazam after Stealth Rock damage. It can also be used to clean weakened teams that tend to lack strong Rock-resistant Pokemon. Close Combat lets Terrakion hit the Steel- and Ground-types that resist its Rock-type coverage such as Ferrothorn and Garchomp; it is also useful for a more accurate way to hit Greninja. Rock Slide provides an extra Rock-type move and can be used when you want to preserve PP on Stone Edge, as well as when you want to be more confident in hitting targets, such as revenge killing Volcarona, for example. Unlike Stone Edge, it also has a flinch chance, which can be useful in certain situations. Toxic allows Terrakion to passively wear down checks that can consistently switch into this set such as Tangrowth and Landorus-T. Earthquake, while somewhat redundant with Terrakion's phenomenal STAB coverage, allows Terrakion to more securely get damage on the likes of Tapu Koko, Mega Mawile, and Magearna, which can all be revenge killed with some prior damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed and Attack investment with a Jolly nature allows Terrakion to make use of its great Speed tier and Attack stat to serve as an efficient revenge killer with its near-unresisted STAB combination. A Choice Scarf is used so that it can perform as one of the best revenge killers in the metagame, being able to outspeed boosted threats like Volcarona, Salamence, and Mega Charizard X and even other fast Choice Scarf users like Nihilego, Garchomp, and Tapu Lele. Justified is Terrakion's only ability and is only situationally helpful, as many threats with Dark-type coverage have other super effective coverage against Terrakion, such as Bisharp and Greninja, meaning that it is not recommended to try to switch directly into Dark-type attacks to get the Justified boost.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Given that this set's primary function is as a revenge killer, it is recommended to bring Terrakion in after an opposing sweeper has KOed a teammate so that it can retaliate using its great STAB coverage. In addition to this, if the opposing team has been sufficiently weakened, this set can also serve as a cleaner due to its great Speed and STAB moves. When using this set, Stone Edge is a more spammable move than Close Combat, but Close Combat can be used if you are predicting a threat that resists Terrakion's Rock-type STAB to switch in, such as a Steel-type like Ferrothorn or a Ground-type like Garchomp. The decision between using Stone Edge and Rock Slide to revenge kill depends on the threat that Terrakion is up against and their amount of HP. For example, it is always safe to use Rock Slide to revenge kill Volcarona, which faints from full, but not against the likes of Salamence and Mega Charizard X, as they are not OHKOed. Stone Edge is necessary until they have taken enough damage to be KOed by Rock Slide. If a threat that can continuously come in on Terrakion such as Landorus-T or Tangrowth is healthy, then it is a good idea to go for Toxic, as it will hinder their ability to switch into Terrakion later on.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pairing Terrakion with partners that appreciate its ability to revenge kill threats such as Volcarona and Mega Charizard X is key, as this gives more opportunities for another sweeper on Terrakion's team, such as Supersonic Skystrike Gyarados, to set up and sweep. If this set wants to have a chance of cleaning end-game after successfully being used to revenge kill threats, it is going to need some key threats worn down or taken out in order to sweep. While Toxic helps wear down Landorus-T, Tangrowth, and other walls, Terrakion is going to need assistance from wallbreakers and other partners that can wear these threats down, such as Greninja, which can also set up. There are also other wallbreakers that help with weakening these threats for Terrakion including Mamoswine, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Mawile. Partners that resist Water and can deal with both Choice Scarf Keldeo and Ash-Greninja serve as great partners due to Terrakion's massive Water-type weakness; Assault Vest Tangrowth works great in this regard and can even wear down Tapu Koko for Terrakion to clean later on in the match if Terrakion forgoes Earthquake.</p> "

  "Tornadus-Therian": {
    "overview": "<p>Tornadus-T is one of the best offensive pivots and Defog users in the OU tier and a solid pick on a variety of team archetypes ranging from offense to balance thanks to its great Speed tier, decent bulk, and more importantly its access to Defog, which allows it to beat entry hazard setters such as Clefable and Ferrothorn with the right set. In addition to this, Tornadus-T can take care of some problematic Pokemon like Kartana and Mega Medicham with Hurricane, a strong Flying-type STAB move with great neutral coverage, which makes it a pain to switch into for some teams. Although Tornadus-T is vulnerable to Stealth Rock and all forms of status, Regenerator gives it the longevity to continually check these threats throughout the course of the game and get rid of entry hazards.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Life Orb can be used instead of Flyinium Z. It should generally be used with a Naive nature to take advantage of Tornadus-T's strong Life-Orb boosted Knock Off while preserving physical bulk for threats such as Kartana, but, Tornadus-T suffers from the loss of HP, and it's generally less useful than Flyinium Z and Rocky Helmet. Superpower can be used with a mixed attacking spread to give Tornadus-T the power to nail common Stealth Rock users such as Heatran and Mega Tyranitar. If using Superpower, a spread of 40 Atk / 216 SpA / 252 Spe with a Naive nature gives Tornadus-T the power to 2HKO bulky Mega Tyranitar, OHKO Choice Band Tyranitar after Stealth Rock, and 2HKO offensive Heatran after Stealth Rock. Assault Vest is a notable alternative for Tornadus-T, as it gives it the bulk to scout against Pokemon such as Greninja thanks to the aid of Regenerator. However, it is generally subpar, as Assault Vest Tornadus-T is rather weak and struggles to put a dent in common defensive Pokemon. Assault Vest Tornadus-T also cannot use Defog, which removes a significant chunk of its utility. Finally, Assault Vest Tornadus-T cannot effectively scout against Pokemon such as Greninja while Stealth Rock is on the field, which makes this set even more difficult to use and far less useful.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Tapu Koko and Other Fast Offensive Pokemon: Tapu Koko is one of the best offensive checks to Tornadus-T. Roost sets are particularly dangerous, as they can quickly heal off anything it throws at Tapu Koko. Pokemon such as Weavile and Ash-Greninja cannot switch in, but they scare Tornadus-T out with the threat of Choice Band Icicle Crash and Choice Specs Hydro Pump, respectively. Weavile can also use Pursuit to eliminate a weakened Tornadus-T.</p> <p><strong>Zapdos: Zapdos completely shuts down Tornadus-T, as it struggles to put a meaningful dent in Zapdos, and can also threaten it with Static. While Tornadus-T can remove Leftovers and wear it down quickly with the aid of Stealth Rock, Tornadus-T is completely walled in a one-on-one situation because of Roost.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Entry Hazard Setters with Recovery</strong>: Pokemon such as Toxapex and Chansey can keep entry hazards up against Tornadus-T. However, Tornadus-T can bring in a partner safely without exposing it to any entry hazards, as well as remove any layers of Spikes set by Pokemon partnered with the aforementioned Pokemon.</p> ",

        "name": "Pivot",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Knock Off provides excellent utility, crippling Pokemon that resist Hurricane and stop it dead in its tracks otherwise, such as Heatran, Zapdos, and Celesteela. It also helps against Pokemon like Landorus-T, Gastrodon, Ferrothorn, and Chansey, which don't appreciate having their item removed. U-turn lets Tornadus-T serve as a pivot and is especially useful to gain momentum against Pokemon that it can force out, such as Kartana and Tapu Bulu. Defog removes entry hazards from the field and can shut down hazard setters like Ferrothorn and defensive Landorus-T. Toxic can be used instead of U-turn to put popular Pokemon like Tapu Koko, Gastrodon, Mega Latias, and Zapdos on a timer, which lays a lot of pressure on them. Although it is a situational move, Heat Wave can also be used instead of U-turn to get off a strong, accurate hit on Kartana, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn. Taunt is yet another option that can be used instead of U-turn to match up better against walls like Toxapex, Ferrothorn, Clefable, and Chansey, as they largely rely on their passive moves to annoy Tornadus-T and its team.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP investment allows Tornadus-T to pivot into Landorus-T, Kartana, and Tapu Bulu. Rocky Helmet punishes U-turn users like Landorus-T and Mega Scizor and also chips away at Kartana's health. Regenerator is Tornadus-T's only ability and is very useful because it grants Tornadus-T important longevity.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Tornadus-T should be used to check Pokemon like Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and Choice Scarf or defensive Landorus-T. Tornadus-T should remove entry hazards if the chance presents itself, as this allows its team to switch around without getting punished by them. Tornadus-T can afford to use U-turn after using Defog due to its high base Speed. Use Knock Off to cripple Pokemon like Heatran, Zapdos, Gastrodon, and Toxapex on the switch. Switch Tornadus-T in against U-turn users like Landorus-T and Mega Scizor to chip away at their health with Rocky Helmet. Try to avoid Toxic from Pokemon like Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Heatran, as it puts heavy pressure on Tornadus-T, making it very hard for it to switch in and effectively remove entry hazards. Watch out for Thunder Wave and Glare from Clefable and Serperior, as paralysis makes Tornadus-T lose its very important Speed tier, which it uses to check Pokemon like Landorus-T, Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and Serperior.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon like Gastrodon and Hippowdon can easily check Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Zapdos, which Tornadus-T tends to struggle against. Gastrodon and Hippowdon themselves tend to struggle against Grass-types, which Tornadus-T has an easy time pressuring. Amoonguss and Tangrowth can form a powerful Regenerator core with Tornadus-T that can check a wide variety of Pokemon. Due to their outstanding synergy, it becomes practically impossible for Pokemon like Tapu Bulu and Kartana to overwhelm this core. Tornadus-T can take on Mega Venusaur, which is a major annoyance to Amoonguss and Tangrowth. In return, Amoonguss and Tangrowth can check Tapu Koko and Ash-Greninja.</p> "

        "name": "Offensive Z-Move",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Supersonic Skystrike allows Tornadus-T to blow through common Pokemon such as Landorus-T and Clefable. Knock Off is an excellent utility move for Tornadus-T, removing Leftovers from common Pokemon that resist Flying-type moves such as Zapdos, Celesteela, and Heatran, as well as items from common special walls such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex,  Assault Vest Magearna, and Chansey. U-turn allows Tornadus-T to serve as a pivot, switching in on Pokemon it can scare out such as Tapu Bulu and Kartana and then using U-turn to pivot safely out as the opponent brings in a check. Defog is a useful utility move for Tornadus-T, clearing entry hazards for its teammates and completely shutting down Pokemon such as defensive Stealth Rock Landorus-T that Tornadus-T completely walls. Taunt lets Tornadus-T more easily break through walls such as Toxapex, but Tornadus-T already struggles to fit all the different moves it would like to use. Additionally, it ensures progress, which is great alongside an inaccurate STAB move like Hurricane. It can also be used instead of Defog on certain teams. Focus Blast in tandem with Fightinium Z allows Tornadus-T to overwhelm usual checks, namely Heatran and Mega Tyranitar. Heat Wave is a neat option instead of U-turn; however, it does a pittance to Celesteela without a Life Orb, and both Celesteela and Ferrothorn are quickly worn down once Leftovers are removed. While lacking U-turn leaves Tornadus-T quite vulnerable to Tyranitar, forgoing Knock Off or Defog is undesirable.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Timid nature preserves Tornadus-T's natural bulk; Tornadus-T uses Knock Off and U-turn for the utility, so the extra damage output that comes from a Hasty or Naive nature is unnecessary. An alternative EV spread of 88 HP / 160 SpA / 8 SpD / 252 Spe can be run to enable Tornadus-T to stomach an Ice Beam from Protean Greninja. Metronome is an option over either Z-Move for a better matchup against the likes of Toxic Spikes Toxapex and Clefable.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Tornadus-T is best used as a utility check to Pokemon such as Kartana and Landorus-T as well as a Defog user for balanced teams that don't mind a single layer of entry hazards but appreciate the situational Defog to remove multiple layers when playing against hazard-stacking teams. Using U-turn against Pokemon that can't significantly dent Tornadus-T such as Specially Defensive Tapu Bulu and defensive Landorus-T lets Tornadus-T rack up Regenerator recovery and quickly heal off any damage it takes. Because of Tornadus-T's high Speed, it can use U-turn after using Defog to clear away particularly troublesome hazards such as Toxic Spikes from Toxapex. This lets it bring in a sweeper safely, even if Tornadus-T cannot beat those hazard setters one-on-one. Use Team Preview to effectively identify which Pokemon Tornadus-T should expend its Z-Move to defeat, as once Supersonic Skystrike is used, Tornadus-T struggles to break through common Pokemon such as Clefable.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Bulkier Pokemon that appreciate the Speed and set of resistances that Tornadus-T brings to the table such as Toxapex are excellent partners. Toxapex also can set up Toxic Spikes, helping Tornadus-T break through checks such as Tyranitar far faster. Strong, bulky wallbreakers such as Heatran are also excellent partners. Heatran in particular appreciates Tornadus-T's ability to use Defog to clear away Spikes and U-turn to bring in Heatran safely. Good checks to Tapu Koko such as Ferrothorn and Specially Defensive Tapu Bulu are also great partners for Tornadus-T.</p> "

  "Thundurus": {
    "overview": "<p>Thundurus acts as niche wallbreaker in the tier thanks to its great Special Attack, colorful coverage, and access to a potent boosting option in Nasty Plot, allowing it to break through metagame staples like Ferrothorn, Toxapex, Tornadus-T, and Celesteela. Thundurus also has a respectable Speed stat, letting it outpace common Pokemon in Garchomp, Kartana, and Mega Latios, and an Electric / Flying typing gives it some useful defensive merits such as an immunity to Earthquake and a resistance to Grass and Flying; these notably allow it to stay in on bulky Grass-types like specially defensive Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth and means it can check Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Kartana. However, Thundurus's mediocre bulk and weakness to Stealth Rock mean it can't do this very reliably. Though Thundurus has overall good coverage, it struggles to break through Grass-types like Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur as well as Calm Mind Mega Latias thanks to its best attack for them being the weak Hidden Power Ice, which they negate with their abilities or stat boosts. Unfortunately, despite its good typing and decent Speed tier, Thundurus is very prone to being revenge killed, either by faster Pokemon like Ash-Greninja, Mega Alakazam, and Tapu Koko or by priority from the likes of Mega Mawile and Mega Medicham.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Flying is an option over Hidden Power Ice that gives Thundurus a better matchup against Grass-types, specifically Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur. It leaves Thundurus unable to OHKO Landorus-T and Gliscor, though, making it the worse choice of Hidden Power the majority of the time. A Defiant set with the moves Thunderbolt, Hidden Power Ice, Knock Off, and Superpower could be used as a means of deterring Defog. However, it can prove to be inconsistent due to its inability to garner any boosts outside of Defiant. Because of this, it has to use Life Orb to attempt to make its offensive presence more consistent, causing it to be worn down exceptionally quickly. Thunder Wave is a decent option over Nasty Plot, providing good general speed control by crippling sweepers and faster Pokemon like Shift Gear Magearna, Mega Alakazam, Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X, and Mega Lopunny, which allows it to act as an emergency check to them. It also catches Tornadus-T if they try to pivot out safely with U-turn.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Revenge Killers and Strong Priority: Thundurus's main downfall is that it has mediocre bulk and just a decent Speed tier, meaning it is very prone to being revenge killed by faster Pokemon like Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, Mega Alakazam, and Mega Lopunny and priority from Pokemon like Mega Mawile and Mega Medicham.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Assault Vest Magearna and Gastrodon take very little from Thundurus's attacks and can retaliate with Fleur Cannon or Toxic, respectively. However, it should be noted that the latter can fall to a +2 All-Out Pummeling after some prior damage. Calm Mind Mega Latias can use Thundurus as setup fodder, even with a Nasty Plot boost. Although 3 Attacks Mega Latias is 2HKOed most of the time by +2 Hidden Power Ice, it can retaliate with an Ice Beam, which threatens to KO Thundurus after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types: Though Thundurus has a good matchup against a few of them, Grass-types like Amoonguss and Mega Venusaur can beat Thundurus handily if it doesn't have Hidden Power Flying, with the former being able to stomach a +2 Hidden Power Ice easily and hit it with Spore and the latter actually walling it thanks to Thick Fat. Even Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth can beat Thundurus if it is weakened.</p> ",

Focus Blast rounds out the set's coverage, hitting Heatran, Ferrothorn, Mega Tyranitar, Chansey, and Kyurem for super effective damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>4 Defense EVs let Thundurus take two unboosted Leaf Blades from Kartana at full HP. Fightinium Z gives Thundurus access to a powerful All-Out Pummeling, which coupled with a Nasty Plot boost can help it break through Pokemon like Assault Vest Tyranitar and Gastrodon. It also helps with the stall matchup, providing Thundurus with a nuke that can break through Quagsire and even Chansey if it has taken some prior damage. Leftovers is an alternative if the Z-Crystal is already in use on Thundurus's team, improving Thundurus's ability to check certain threats while also making it more resistant to being revenge killed. However, it comes at the cost of a worsened stall matchup.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Early- and mid-game, bring in Thundurus through double switches, on a free switch from Volt Switch or U-turn, or after a teammate faints to break through teams; set up Nasty Plot on forced switches in order to break through the opposing team. Thanks to Thundurus's typing and coverage, it can stay in on Grass-types like Ferrothorn, specially defensive Tapu Bulu, and Tangrowth that may try to switch in on a predicted Thunderbolt. Aside from its offensive capabilities, Thundurus can be used as a switch-in to Pokemon like Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Kartana, though it should be noted that it will fall to coverage from Landorus-T and can lose to the other two if Stealth Rock is up or it has taken even minor chip damage. Furthermore, if Thundurus takes too much damage from trying to check these Pokemon, it will no longer be able to take a hit from the aforementioned Grass-types after setting up, forfeiting its ability to break through them. Against more offensive teams, it can be better to just throw out attacks rather than to set up, as Thundurus won't have as many opportunities to set up due to being outsped by Pokemon commonly found on such teams like Mega Alakazam, Greninja, and Tapu Koko.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Thundurus should be used on offensive teams due to its fragility and relative lack of setup opportunities, so it should be paired with other Pokemon that fit on this archetype. Mega Latias is a big issue for Thundurus; 3 Attacks Mega Latias can comfortably take a +2 Hidden Power Ice and retaliate with Ice Beam, which can KO after Stealth Rock, while Calm Mind Mega Latias actually uses Thundurus as setup fodder. Pursuit support from Tyranitar and Weavile can remove Mega Latias, making them very valuable partners. VoltTurn users like Landorus-T, Assault Vest Magearna, and Tornadus-T are great assets to Thundurus, as they give it more opportunities to wallbreak. Entry hazard setters like Focus Sash Landorus-T, Greninja, and Excadrill work well alongside Thundurus on hyper offensive teams, as they help to weaken its checks in range with Stealth Rock and Spikes. Sticky Web is an interesting option, rendering Pokemon like Mega Alakazam and Protean Greninja unable to revenge kill Thundurus, so Araquanid and Ribombee can be good partners to set it up. Sweepers found on hyper offense like Shift Gear Magearna, Dragon Dance Mega Charizard X, and Dragon Dance Mega Gyarados that can clean up after Thundurus has broken through the opposing team are great teammates.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Thundurus-T is a powerful Electric-type wallbreaker that is able to power through typical Electric-type checks such as Tangrowth, Ferrothorn, Mega Venusaur, and Gastrodon thanks to the combination of an absurdly high Special Attack stat and a vast movepool. Despite its high Special Attack, Thundurus-T depends on boosting with Nasty Plot to break past the aforementioned Pokemon and specially defensive Pokemon like Mega Latias and Magearna. This is often easier said than done because Thundurus-T's Speed, while decent for a wallbreaker, leaves it easily revenge killed by much faster Pokemon like Mega Alakazam, Greninja, and Garchomp, which means it often won't get a safe chance to boost. Thundurus-T has issues breaking neutral targets such as Mega Latias and Mega Latios because it relies on Hidden Power Flying to hit these Pokemon. As an offensive Electric-type, Thundurus-T is heavily overshadowed by Tapu Koko, which is much faster and provides more utility for a team beyond just being a wallbreaker.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Electrium Z can give Thundurus-T an extremely powerful STAB Z-Move that gives it a better matchup against Assault Vest Magearna, but it loses the ability to dent Pokemon like Chansey. Thundurus-T can make use of Agility to boost its Speed, which improves its offensive matchup against Pokemon like Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Mega Medicham, but this requires giving up an important coverage option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Threats: Thundurus-T's merely decent Speed means that it is outsped and threatened by Pokemon such as Mega Diancie, Greninja, and Mega Lopunny. Still, keep in mind that none of these Pokemon want to switch directly into Thundurus-T's moves. Mega Latias, however, can freely switch into Thundurus-T's coverage and STAB moves and easily recover back its health, while Mega Alakazam can easily Trace Volt Absorb and block its STAB attacks. Both of these Pokemon threaten Thundurus-T out of the battlefield because it only has Hidden Power Flying to deal any significant damage to them, while they can easily retaliate after switching in with their powerful moves.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Chansey, and Assault Vest Magearna take any move that Thundurus-T goes for and can either recover the damage done or retaliate with Toxic or Fleur Cannon and Ice Beam in Magearna's case. While these Pokemon do need to be cautious of Thundurus-T's Z-Move, they can deal with it more easily once it has exhausted its Z-Move, forcing Thundurus-T to continue boosting with Nasty Plot in order to beat them. Unaware Clefable is also a definite counter because it will always take very little damage from Thundurus-T's attacks. Even though this is mitigated by Electrium Z, it still requires prediction for Thundurus-T to beat Clefable.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hidden Power Flying is Thundurus-T's only special Flying-type STAB move, but it is necessary to power through bulky Grass-types such as Mega Venusaur, Tapu Bulu, and Tangrowth as well as provide neutral damage to Pokemon like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Mega Alakazam without using its Z-Move. Focus Blast powered by Fightinium Z allows Thundurus-T to OHKO Ferrothorn and Assault Vest Tyranitar and severely dent Chansey at +2. Hidden Power Ice is an alternative move to hit Ground-types such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor for super effective damage while still being able to hit Grass-types, but it comes with the cost of losing coverage against Pokemon like Mega Venusaur and Mega Alakazam.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Fightinium Z is used to power through Pokemon such as Chansey, Gastrodon, and Ferrothorn. Volt Absorb gives Thundurus-T some defensive utility by being able to switch into a Choice-locked Tapu Koko's Electric-type STAB move or Volt Switch from Pokemon like Rotom-W and Magearna and recover some health while denying them momentum.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against balanced teams, it is best to determine whether Thundurus-T even has an opportunity to set up, especially against faster offensive threats like Garchomp, Mega Latias, and Mega Alakazam, since they can switch into it and threaten it out, which is why it is best to simply fire off a strong attack so that they don't necessarily come in for free. Thundurus-T can take advantage of its typing to freely set up against Pokemon such as Celesteela and Mega Scizor. Thundurus-T can also come into battle by a teammate pivoting against other Electric-types such as Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Magnezone, but this play is generally not worth it because Thundurus-T relies on being healthy in order to effectively break foes like Assault Vest Magearna while having a chance to stay out of KO range of revenge killers' neutral attacks. Before sending Thundurus-T into battle, make sure Stealth Rock is cleared, as it can wear Thundurus-T down quickly if it switches into battle repeatedly. Try to save Thundurus-T's Z-Move for a target that is normally not threatened by either Thunderbolt or Hidden Power Flying such as Chansey, Assault Vest Tyranitar, or Gastrodon.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard removal from the likes of Tornadus-T, Tapu Fini, and Landorus-T makes them excellent partners to give Thundurus-T an easier time coming into battle. Toxapex can make a decent parter for Thundurus-T because of its ability to set Toxic Spikes, which can ease Thundurus-T's matchup against Gastrodon and Tangrowth. Pivots such as Landorus-T, Magearna, and Tornadus-T make for fantastic partners for Thundurus-T because they can bring it into the battlefield safely. Landorus-T also provides Intimidate support. Other offensive Pokemon like Ash-Greninja, Kartana, and Tapu Lele greatly appreciate Thundurus-T luring in and removing bulky Grass-, Water-, and Steel-types. Mega Scizor can also make for a decent teammate, since it also lures in Water-, Steel-, and Electric-types such as Magnezone, Toxapex, and Celesteela for Thundurus-T.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Landorus-T is incredibly versatile. It can function as an effective pivot thanks to its access to Intimidate and U-turn, whether that be an offensive pivot that takes advantage of its sky-high Attack stat or a bulky one that makes use of its access to Stealth Rock and useful set of resistances, checking Pokemon like Mega Pinsir and Mega Lopunny. It can also function as a potent wallbreaker thanks to its access to Swords Dance and its dangerous STAB combination in conjunction with Z-Moves. However, its weaknesses to Ice and Water often cause issues given that they are both very common types on offensive and defensive Pokemon alike such as Weavile, Ash-Greninja, and Toxapex, and its lack of recovery options hurts its ability to check certain Pokemon repeatedly throughout the match. Its average Speed stat also leaves it below the important base 95 benchmark, leaving it vulnerable to dangerous Pokemon that sit on or above it such as Tapu Lele, Kyurem-B, Volcarona, and Mega Medicham.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Soft Sand or Groundium Z can be used on the Swords Dance set to present a greater offensive presence, with Soft Sand also being useful over Rockium Z if a Z-Crystal is needed on another teammate. Continental Crush variants could run Rock Polish over Stealth Rock to provide Landorus-T with the option to pose a greater threat to offensive teams when needed. Sludge Bomb is an option on Choice Scarf variants to punish Tapu Bulu and put pressure onto switch-ins like Tangrowth and Zapdos courtesy of its high poison rate. Punishment can be used on Choice Scarf variants on teams that lack consistent counterplay versus Mega Latias and Reuniclus. Earth Power can be used on Choice Scarf and defensive variants to hit Kartana if Landorus-T can't afford to give up Hidden Power Ice, but the power drop is noticeable if you sacrifice Earthquake, and other utility moves are usually preferred over running the two moves together.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Pokemon Immune to Ground: Skarmory, Rotom-W, Zapdos, and Celesteela take very little from most of what Landorus-T can throw at them. The same applies to Gliscor, which eventually wins out versus faster non-Z-Move variants of Landorus-T if it switches in on anything other than Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types: Tangrowth can wall any set that doesn't carry a Z-Move. The same applies to Tapu Bulu, which can both set up on Landorus-T and further hinder its general functionality with Grassy Surge.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Greninja and Manaphy outspeed non-Choice Scarf Landorus-T and force it out with their STAB attacks, with Ash-Greninja threatening Choice Scarf variants with Water Shuriken. If Rotom-W switches in on Earthquake against Choice Scarf or defensive Landorus-T, it can force it out with the threat of Hydro Pump or Will-O-Wisp. Gyarados is immune to Earthquake and can potentially use the opportunity to clean up versus non-Stone Edge variants.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon and Ice-type Coverage: Kyurem-B, Weavile, and Mamoswine can easily OHKO Landorus-T with their STAB moves, with the latter two beating Choice Scarf Landorus-T with Ice Shard. Ice Punch variants of Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny can put a lot of pressure onto Landorus-T, as it will often need to use its resistances to pivot through them, and similarly, it's not uncommon for more defensively inclined Pokemon like Clefable and Mew to carry Ice Beam for Landorus-T.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers: Landorus-T struggles to take hits from the likes of Mega Latios, Heatran, Tornadus, and Tapu Lele, since it has mediocre special bulk.</p> ",

Stone Edge notably allows Landorus-T to remove Tornadus-T, as well as other Pokemon like Gyarados, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Pinsir, while having good neutral coverage alongside Earthquake. Explosion is Landorus-T's strongest option versus Rotom-W and Tapu Bulu; it additionally gives teammates a free switch-in and prevents slower Pokemon's attempts at clearing entry hazards on the turn that it is used. Defog is useful for if the team Landorus-T is used on can't afford to use another Pokemon for entry hazard removal. Hidden Power Ice allows Landorus-T to hit opposing Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor hard. Knock Off can be used to cause issues for Pokemon like Celesteela and Assault Vest Tangrowth that are otherwise consistent stops to Choice Scarf Landorus-T. Superpower can be used to OHKO Kartana and Mega Gyarados with a little prior damage and is also Landorus-T's strongest move versus Ferrothorn.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The listed EV spread makes Landorus-T one point faster than a boosted Kommo-o and allows it to survive +2 Acrobatics from Hawlucha after Stealth Rock. Bulkier EV spreads such as 80 HP / 148 Atk / 84 Def / 196 Spe, which allows Landorus-T to avoid a 2HKO from Kartana's Leaf Blade after Stealth Rock damage, are also viable options if the role compression they provide is important. Naive should be run alongside Hidden Power Ice to guarantee that Landorus-T 2HKOes certain bulkier Gliscor variants.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Landorus-T as an offensive check to Pokemon like Mega Alakazam and Tapu Koko, and use it as a pivot to help get frailer teammates onto the field safely. Use U-turn a lot early-game and generally try to avoid using Earthquake unless Landorus-T can clean up or it is otherwise advantageous to do so, as it is easy for dangerous Pokemon like Mega Pinsir, Tapu Bulu, and Gyarados to take advantage of.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Wallbreakers and cleaners that appreciate U-turn and take advantage of Landorus-T's stops, such as Kyurem-B, Heatran, Hoopa-U, and Volcarona, make for good partners. Mega Scizor, Tornadus-T, Tapu Koko, and Rotom-W can all form highly potent VoltTurn cores when used alongside Landorus-T. Defensively, this set appreciates checks to Water- and Ice-types, such as Tangrowth and Mega Scizor. Since Landorus-T fails to outspeed boosted Volcarona and Mega Charizard X, defensive checks to those, notably including Toxapex and Tyranitar, make for good partners.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Stealth Rock is an invaluable move, as it allows Landorus-T to take advantage of the switches it forces and put even more pressure onto the opposing team. Fly is used alongside Flyinium Z to break through common switch-ins to Landorus-T such as Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu and functions well as an all-purpose nuke versus bulky neutral targets. Alternatively, Stone Edge can be used alongside Rockium Z to punish Flying-types that resist Fly such as Celesteela and Zapdos. It also provides Landorus-T with virtually perfect neutral coverage, notably hitting Tornadus-T and Mega Charizard Y hard without needing to use up its Z-Move.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment allows Landorus-T to outrun Pokemon like Naughty Kyurem-B and Gyarados, thus preventing them from revenge killing it easily. Flyinium Z is needed when running Fly in order to circumvent Fly's charge turn and give it a significant damage boost. Meanwhile, Rockium Z allows it to knock out Celesteela after a Swords Dance boost with some prior damage and heavily dent neutral targets such as opposing Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is best used to put a dent into bulkier teams and pave the way for faster attackers such as Mega Alakazam and Dragon Dance Gyarados to clean up. Landorus-T should set up Stealth Rock or Swords Dance against foes that it forces out, such as Heatran and Magearna, although it needs to be wary of the threat posed by their attacks. Consider bluffing a non-Z-Move variant to help ensure that Supersonic Skystrike lands against targets like Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth instead of being wasted on the wrong target. Keep the option of using Fly without the Z-Crystal in the back of your mind either when your opponent is out of options to react to it with or if you need to buy a turn to stall for Toxic damage or something similar, although it's not recommended to use it outside of specific scenarios like this.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>If running Fly, Pokemon like Ash-Greninja and Mega Gyarados, which appreciate Grass-types being removed from the picture, are able to take good advantage of Supersonic Skystrike's utility. Alternatively, when running Stone Edge alongise Rockium Z, Landorus-T is best paired with attackers that appreciate the removal of Celesteela, Rotom-W, and Tapu Bulu such as Tornadus-T, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Pinsir. It's important to cover Landorus-T's weaknesses due to its Speed tier that can be taken advantage of, so Pokemon that can switch into Water- and Ice-types, such as Toxapex, Mega Scizor, and Assault Vest Tangrowth, make good partners. U-turn and Volt Switch support is very helpful for getting Landorus-T onto the field safely and preserving its health, with the aforementioned Mega Scizor being particularly notable due to its tendency to invite Heatran onto the field.</p> "

Alternatively, Fly can be used alongside Flyinium Z to provide Landorus-T with a strong nuke against frail attackers and bulky Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu. U-turn takes advantage of Landorus-T's low Speed stat to grab momentum and help frail teammates switch in without taking damage. Stone Edge hits Tornadus-T and Mega Pinsir extremely hard, prevents Volcarona from setting up a Quiver Dance on Landorus-T, and helps Landorus-T deal with Hidden Power Ice Zapdos. Toxic gives opposing Landorus-T, Tangrowth, Tapu Bulu, and Zapdos a headache. Defog is also an option over Stealth Rock if you have another Stealth Rock user and can't afford to carry entry hazard removal on anything else.

Running this much Speed investment has some added benefits, notably making Landorus-T faster than Hoopa-U, most opposing Landorus-T, and Jolly Mega Tyranitar but comes at the cost of reliability against stronger physical threats. Rocky Helmet is useful for punishing opposing Landorus-T and Tapu Koko's U-turns. Lastly, Figy Berry is an alternative that lets Landorus-T take powerful hits and recover 50% of its HP. Flyinium Z must be used when running Fly to enable Landorus-T to remove foes such as Mega Heracross and Hawlucha.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Stealth Rock should be set up against foes that are either forced out or otherwise don't pose a significant threat to Landorus-T.

Its high base Special Attack and access to Ice- and Ground-type coverage let it hit a vast majority of the OU tier for neutral damage and threaten many common Pokemon like Landorus-T, Heatran, and Tornadus-T. However, Kyurem's mediocre base 95 Speed leaves more to be wished for in a metagame full of faster threats that can beat it, such as Mega Alakazam, Mega Medicham, and Kartana. Kyurem is also susceptible to every form of entry hazard and requires entry hazard control to perform its niche to its fullest potential. Moreover, Kyurem's ability to PP stall takes a big hit if it is inflicted with status, which is fairly common in the OU metagame, and its typing leaves it susceptible to the plethora of Steel-, Fairy-, and Fighting-type Pokemon and moves that plague the tier.</p> ",

Once behind a Substitute, Kyurem is able to PP stall super effective moves with low PP, such as Ferrothorn's Gyro Ball and Tyranitar's Stone Edge. Ice Beam and Earth Power allow Kyurem to break through common defensive backbones consisting of Pokemon such as Heatran, Tangrowth, Tapu Bulu, and Toxapex. Roost is crucial for keeping Kyurem healthy throughout the match and lets Kyurem PP stall foes with the combination of Substitute and Pressure.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>56 HP EVs give Kyurem 101 HP Substitutes, preventing Chansey from breaking them with Seismic Toss. 4 Special Defense EVs ensure Kyurem avoids the OHKO from Mega Charizard Y's Fire Blast. Metronome pairs nicely with Substitute, allowing Kyurem to possibly muscle through defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Celesteela, Clefable, and most importantly Toxapex, which Kyurem would struggle to break through otherwise, thanks to the additional damage per turn. Icium Z lets Kyurem use Subzero Slammer, which is difficult to switch into offensively and defensively. Subzero Slammer is especially useful if Kyurem is behind a Substitute, OHKOing Pokemon that could otherwise stomach a hit and force it out like Mega Alakazam, Tapu Lele, Mega Medicham, and Clefable. Leftovers is an acceptable alternative to potentially give Kyurem more opportunities to use Substitute throughout the game, but it misses out on the additional power that Metronome and Icium Z provide.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Kyurem's priority should be to set up a Substitute against Pokemon that it forces out or Pokemon that can't break its Substitute, such as Tangrowth and Toxapex. Once behind a Substitute, Kyurem's combination of Pressure, Roost, and respectable bulk should be utilized to deplete Pokemon of their PP. Some examples include Celesteela and Clefable, as these can be PP stalled out of Heavy Slam and Moonblast, respectively, once behind a Substitute. Try to keep Stealth Rock and other entry hazards off of the field to keep Kyurem as healthy as possible and maximize its ability to switch into Pokemon it can beat like Tangrowth and Tornadus-T. Leech Seed and status conditions, especially paralysis and poison, hinder Kyurem's ability to PP stall foes, so try not to switch into status-inducing moves and avoid them with Substitute whenever possible. At times, using Substitute isn't necessary; if the opponent's team struggles to switch into Kyurem's coverage or is more offensively inclined, then attacking and weakening the opposing team for its teammates is beneficial. Kyurem should utilize its Ice- and Ground-type coverage effectively to dent common defensive backbones consisting of Heatran, Tapu Bulu, and Landorus-T.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard removers, such as Tornadus-T, Rotom-W, and Landorus-T, are vital to prevent Kyurem from being worn down over time. Defensive Landorus-T pairs nicely with Kyurem because it can lure in Grass-types that Kyurem can beat with ease, such as Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu, and it can also help against physical threats that can threaten Kyurem like Mega Lopunny and Kartana. Kyurem greatly appreciates Toxic Spikes support to wear down the opposing team over time and make its job of stalling foes out easier. Toxapex is a phenomenal partner, as it can set up Toxic Spikes of its own and absorb opposing ones while helping counter Pokemon that trouble Kyurem like Mega Scizor, Volcarona, and Ash-Greninja. Reuniclus also benefits from Toxic Spikes and appreciates Kyurem's ability to beat common Taunt users like Heatran and Tornadus-T. Magearna, specifically Shift Gear and Calm Mind variants, makes for a good teammate, as it can take advantage of teams that have been weakened by Kyurem to have an easier time sweeping late-game. Magearna also appreciates Kyurem's ability to pressure opposing Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Assault Vest Magearna, and Heatran. Similarly, threatening wallbreakers like Mega Mawile and Mega Alakazam appreciate the pressure that Kyurem exerts on the Steel-types mentioned earlier and are difficult for offensive teams that can pressure Kyurem to switch into. Celesteela can form an annoying core with Kyurem, especially if paired with Toxapex, thanks to Leech Seed allowing it to slowly wear down the opposing team. Celesteela can also pressure certain Fairy- and Steel-types that can give Kyurem trouble like Magearna and Scizor. Magnezone can trap and potentially remove annoying Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Kartana, and Celesteela for Kyurem.</p> "

Kyurem-B's bulk is also quite good, enabling it to come in on some passive Pokemon like Zapdos, Gliscor, and Tangrowth lacking Sludge Bomb, as well as taking at least one hit from faster Pokemon like Serperior, Tapu Koko, and Greninja. However, its weak defensive typing and vulnerability to entry hazards, especially Stealth Rock, make its entry opportunities more limited than they may seem; it usually relies on aggressive switches and pivot support to get on the field. Thus, Kyurem-B can sometimes have trouble doing its job against bulkier teams: Life Orb sets especially, due to the added recoil forcing more uses of Roost. Kyurem-B is also quite vulnerable to status ailments from Pokemon like Toxapex, Gliscor, and Tangrowth, making switching into these Pokemon not as risk-free as it may appear. Also, while its matchup against bulkier teams is great despite its entry struggles, Kyurem-B struggles against faster offensive teams, which can revenge kill it easily with Pokemon such as Kartana, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Diancie due to its average Speed.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Substitute + Hone Claws with Freeze Shock and Fusion Bolt theoretically demolishes balance and stall teams thanks to Terravolt negating Unaware and Kyurem-B punishing switches very effectively in general. This set runs 52 HP EVs to let its Substitute have 101 HP so Seismic Toss doesn't immediately break it. However, the low PP of the set's attacks, along with its inability to meaningfully damage to some Steel-types that can break its Substitute like Mega Scizor and Jirachi, makes it inconsistent and typically inferior.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Defensive Magearna and Jirachi can very effectively handle the majority of Kyurem-B sets, Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn can switch into sets lacking Hidden Power Fire and heal the damage, and Heatran can switch into sets lacking Earth Power relatively well. Mega Mawile is able to take one hit from full health, except for Gigavolt Havoc in Electric Terrain, and OHKO Kyurem-B. However, many Steel-types lack recovery and aren't hard to wear down into KO range, so they aren't very good long-term checks regardless of Kyurem-B's coverage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Faster offensive Pokemon like Mega Alakazam, Mega Lopunny, Victini, Mega Diancie, Tapu Lele, Mega Medicham, Z-Move Garchomp, Choice Specs Tapu Koko, and Kartana all force Kyurem-B out with their strong attacks and higher Speed but they typically cannot switch in safely.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards and Residual Damage: Entry hazards, mainly Stealth Rock, make Kyurem-B very easy to wear down and minimize the benefits of its good bulk. This issue is furthered by potential Life Orb recoil and other forms of residual damage. Kyurem-B is also quite vulnerable to status when Misty Terrain or Substitute isn't up, which makes it much easier to pivot around and offensively pressure.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Set Description</h1> <p>Freeze Shock's Subzero Slammer lets Kyurem-B blow through any Pokemon that doesn't resist it and deal a ton of damage to most Pokemon that do. Freeze Shock itself should only be used if behind a Substitute and after Subzero Slammer. Fusion Bolt hits Water-types like Toxapex, Tapu Fini, Manaphy, and Slowbro. Its good power and neutral coverage make it a generally safe choice, especially in Electric Terrain. Ice Beam lets Kyurem-B handle Ice-weak Pokemon like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Zapdos, and Tangrowth without or after burning its Z-Move. Earth Power hits Rotom-W and Steel-types such as Heatran and Jirachi. Make sure to not reveal Earth Power too early though, as you want to surprise them as they come in. Substitute lets Kyurem-B punish switches, lessen prediction, and block status moves from Pokemon like Toxapex, Rotom-W, Gliscor, Zapdos, and Tangrowth. It should be used against passive Pokemon. Roost can be used in the last moveslot for sustainability against bulkier teams. Kyurem-B can also pivot into resisted and weak attacks like Greninja's Hydro Pump and Heatran's Earth Power. Naive is used over Hasty to take hits from Pokemon like Landorus-T and Kartana better. However, Hasty can be used if you're well-covered against those threats and prefer to take hits from Battle Bond Greninja, Reuniclus lacking Focus Blast, and Mega Latias. Electrium Z can be used over Icium Z to massively damage the Steel-tyes typically used to absorb Subzero Slammer and even OHKOes Celesteela. If using it, Kyurem-B should replace Freeze Shock with Earth Power or Roost.</p> <p>At Team Preview, see what Pokemon Kyurem-B is able to break through, what Pokemon it should aim to hit hard with its Z-Move, and if entry hazards are necessary to achieve any really important KOs. The Z-Move should only be used if you're confident it will make progress you can capitalize on. Get Kyurem-B in on Pokemon that can't do too much much to it like Toxapex lacking Toxic, Tangrowth, Gliscor, Zapdos, and Reuniclus lacking Focus Blast. It's ideal to get it in on these Pokemon as they use a recovery move.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tapu Fini protects Kyurem-B from status with Misty Terrain, clears Stealth Rock with Defog, and threatens Heatran with Scald—if Kyurem-B lacks Earth Power—and Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor with Nature's Madness. Kyurem-B destroys Grass-types and Rotom-W for Tapu Fini while also beating Gliscor and Heatran if running Earth Power, which frees Tapu Fini up to run Nature's Madness over Scald. Entry hazard control sources like Tapu Fini, Rotom-W, Tornadus-T, and Gliscor are important for its Stealth Rock weakness. VoltTurn users like Landorus-T, defensive Magearna, Tornadus-T, Mega Scizor, Rotom-W, and Tapu Koko are able to pivot Kyurem-B into slower Pokemon safely. Tapu Koko, in particular, brings Electric Terrain to boost Fusion Bolt's power and is an essential partner if running Electrium Z. Mega Alakazam, Choice Scarf Kartana, and Mega Lopunny appreciate Kyurem-B hitting a bulky foe with its Z-Move and are good against faster offensive teams. Spikes support from Greninja and Ferrothorn can wear down Pokemon into KO range of Kyurem-B's attacks, and Kyurem-B threatens Pokemon immune to Spikes like Gliscor and Rotom-W with its coverage. This support works especially well with Electrium Z sets because the Pokemon can take Gigavolt Havoc are very vulnerable to Spikes. Steel-types like Jirachi, Mega Scizor, Magearna, Ferrothorn, and Heatran can switch into Rock- and Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele, Tyranitar, and Clefable. Heatran is a particularly great partner because it can handle Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn while providing Stealth Rock support. In return, Kyurem-B wears down or takes out Tapu Fini, Gliscor, Mega Latias, and Mega Latios. All Steel-types appreciate Kyurem-B scaring out Ground- and Water-types.</p> "

It also means Kyurem-B can switch into resisted and weak attacks like Greninja's Hydro Pump and Heatran's Earth Power. Hidden Power Fire hits Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor much harder than Earth Power while still denting most other Steel-types like Jirachi. Earth Power, on the other hand, hits Rotom-W, Heatran, and Jirachi as hard as possible. Naive is used over Hasty to take hits from Pokemon like Landorus-T and Kartana better. However, Hasty can be used if you're well covered against those threats and prefer to take hits from Battle Bond Greninja, Reuniclus lacking Focus Blast, and Mega Latias. This 3 attacks set optimizes Kyurem-B's coverage against Ice-resistant Pokemon and lets it act as a versatile wallbreaker.</p> <p>Use Kyurem-B to do as much damage as possible throughout the game so its faster teammates can clean. Prediction is key, as many Pokemon coming into it can take one of its moves but not others. Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn will likely scout for Hidden Power Fire, so don't reveal it immediately. The same is true for Heatran and Rotom-W with Earth Power. Ice Beam is a good move to use a lot of the time, since it has great coverage.  Keeping Kyurem-B healthy is especially important against bulkier teams and teams with offensive threats Kyurem-B can defensively handle, like Serperior and Gigavolt Havoc Rotom-W.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tapu Fini protects Kyurem-B from status with Misty Terrain, clears Stealth Rock with Defog, and threatens Heatran with Scald—if Kyurem-B lacks Earth Power—and Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor with Nature's Madness—if lacking Hidden Power Fire.

Tapu Koko, in particular, brings Electric Terrain to boost Fusion Bolt's power. Spikes support from Greninja and Ferrothorn can wear down Pokemon into KO range of Kyurem-B's attacks, which is especially important considering Kyurem-B wants to minimize recoil and lacks a Z-Move nuke. Other wallbreakers, including Mega Mawile, Choice Band Kartana, and Mega Medicham, can team up with Kyurem-B to suffocate bulkier teams. Life Orb Kyurem-B isn't as reliable a solo wallbreaker as its Z-Move set, so another wallbreaker relieves pressure. Shift Gear Magearna, Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, and Mega Lopunny appreciate Life Orb Kyurem-B more comfortably wearing foes down long term than the Z-Move set, and they are good against faster offensive teams. Steel-types like Jirachi, Mega Scizor, defensive Magearna, and Heatran can switch into Rock- and Fairy-types such as Tapu Lele, Tyranitar, and Clefable. Heatran is a particularly great partner because it can handle Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn while providing Stealth Rock support. Due to this set lacking a Z-Move, other Z-Move users such as Shift Gear Magearna, Swords Dance Kartana, and Tapu Koko can be run and make the team's true Z-Move user harder to predict.</p> "

Keldeo's STAB Secret Sword also allows it to bypass traditional checks to special attacking Water-types such as Chansey and Ferrothorn. Unfortunately, not all shines for Keldeo, as numerous Pokemon such as Toxapex, Amoonguss, and Tapu Fini are all hard counters to most Keldeo sets. Keldeo also lacks any powerful coverage options and is forced to rely on weaker moves such as Hidden Power and Icy Wind.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Calm Mind + 3 Attack set with Hyper Beam and Normalium Z allows Keldeo to not only boost its Special Attack but to blow through traditional counters such as Toxapex and Tapu Fini with a powerful Breakneck Blitz as well. This set has only one attempt to get off its Z-Move, though, and it is very weak without a boost. Choice Scarf can be used to pressure normally faster Pokemon such as Ash-Greninja and Volcarona, but is very mediocre at accomplishing anything else, because of the popularity of bulky Grass-types and Toxapex. Toxic, while undesirable to be Choice locked into, can be useful for chipping away at Pokemon such as Tangrowth and Slowbro that take little damage from any of Keldeo's attacks but despise status ailments.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Bulky Water-types such as Toxapex, Mantine, Tapu Fini, and Slowbro all resist Keldeo's STAB attacks and can either status Keldeo or hit it super effectively with their STAB attacks.

It also stops them from draining Keldeo's health with Toxic and Leech Seed. Keldeo can break past Toxapex with burn and hazards long-term, making it a better choice overall compared to Taunt, which aims to break past Toxapex immediately by setting up on it and blowing it back with the combination of Waterium Z and Hydro Pump. Scald is Keldeo's most spammable move and is used instead of Hydro Pump for its reliability and higher PP on Substitute sets, as well as its burn chance. This allows Keldeo to annoy common cores such as Heatran + Tapu Bulu. Secret Sword allows Keldeo to beat Chansey and pressure Assault Vest variants of Tangrowth and Magearna while letting it beat other Pokemon that resist Scald such as Ferrothorn, Ash-Greninja, Kyurem-B, and Kyurem.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Leftovers heals chip damage from defensive foes that have been Taunted such as Scald from Toxapex and Heavy Slam from Celesteela, allowing Keldeo to set up more Calm Mind boosts and beat bulky teams with a bit more ease. It also provides Keldeo with longevity so that it can switch into the likes of Heatran and Ash-Greninja more safely.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against more offensive teams, Keldeo can be switched into resisted attacks from foes that it forces out such as Heatran, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Tyranitar. Scald should be spammed early-game to fish for burns on the likes of Tapu Bulu, Mega Latios, and Mega Latias. Keldeo should only attempt to set up once its checks have been weakened or removed. Taunt should be used before setting up against Pokemon that can use Toxic such as Heatran, Toxapex, and Chansey, as a poison status can prevent Keldeo from beating bulky teams effectively. Keldeo can be used to beat a lot of stall teams on its own, but it should first be brought in via an aggressive switch, as most Pokemon used on this playstyle will be able to poison or burn Keldeo or Knock Off its Leftovers before it can start setting up. Keldeo also has to be wary of physically defensive Tangrowth, Unaware Clefable, and Heart Swap Magearna on these teams, as they can tank its attacks and force it out with their super effective STAB moves.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Keldeo struggles to beat Mega Latios and Mega Latias, so Pursuit trappers that are able to remove them such as Tyranitar and Weavile make useful partners. Entry hazards, especially Spikes, make Keldeo's job a lot easier. Hazard setters like Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Mega Tyranitar are able to keep up hazards for most of the game. Powerful wallbreakers like Mega Mawile, Mega Medicham, and Rockium Z Garchomp form strong offensive cores with Keldeo. The latter two can also force in and weaken Fairy-types such as Clefable and Tapu Fini that give Keldeo a hard time, while the former can take advantage of bulky Grass-types that Keldeo forces in. Keldeo can act as a check to Ash-Greninja and Heatran, but it gets worn down quickly, so other checks to these Pokemon such as Toxapex and Tapu Bulu, or Garchomp and Mega Latias, respectively, are needed. Bulky Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth can take even a boosted attack from Keldeo and force it out, so a reliable switch-in to these Pokemon such as Tornadus-T or Mega Scizor is a useful partner. Bulky Steel-types such as Celesteela and defensive variants of Magearna are able to take on Fairy-types like Clefable and Tapu Bulu that give Keldeo a hard time. They also provide a secondary soft check to Ash-Greninja.</p> "

  "Greninja": {
    "overview": "<h1>Ash-Greninja</h1> <p>Ash-Greninja is a top Pokemon because its excellent offensive typing combines with its monstrous Special Attack and Speed stats to turn it into a dangerous attacker that is capable of shredding offensive teams. This is further enhanced by its access to Water Shuriken, which is one of the most powerful priority moves in the game if Battle Bond has activated. It's also one of the best offensive Spikers in the tier, being able to wear down its own checks and counters. However, until it successfully knocks something out, Greninja needs to go through its mediocre base forme, which functionally lacks an ability. This means that it can have a lot of difficulty breaking through a number of common defensive Pokemon like Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Assault Vest Magearna. It is also frail, meaning that it has a lot of difficulty switching into even strong resisted hits consistently.</p> <h1>Greninja</h1> <p>Greninja, courtesy of its stellar Speed tier and amazing ability in Protean, is one of the OverUsed metagame's premier offensive threats, as it is more than capable of pressuring both faster, offensively inclined teams and bulkier builds. Its expansive movepool is a major contributing factor to its potency as an offensive force as well: because it has such a high number of move options, it can circumvent would-be counters and defensive checks and leave one's opponent guessing at Team Preview. Additionally, Greninja is one of the few viable offensively inclined user of Spikes and Toxic Spikes, which it is a stellar user of. Greninja only truly falls short when it comes to bulk, which renders it incapable of taking even resisted hits repeatedly, and the inability to run every coverage move on one set.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <section><h1>Ash-Greninja</h1> <p>Most options not already mentioned are generally subpar on Ash-Greninja. Gunk Shot can be a decent option on select rain teams to lure Tapu Bulu and Tapu Fini, though it leaves Ash-Greninja with no way to punish Toxapex and is horrendous to be locked into.</p> <h1>Greninja</h1> <p>Hidden Power Electric is an option on regular Greninja to hit Gyarados and Mantine. Z-Happy Hour Greninja can serve as a threatening sweeper, but it suffers from lack of viability because of Greninja's frailty and lack of coverage when using it.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Ash-Greninja</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: These Pokemon mean that Greninja can't mindlessly spam Hydro Pump and Water Shuriken like it wants to. Toxapex can easily take a few uses of Dark Pulse unless the Greninja user has used multiple entry hazards, and specially defensive sets are not terribly prone to falling victim to flinches. Tapu Fini resists both of Greninja's STAB moves courtesy of its typing. It also has access to Defog, meaning it can remove the Spikes Greninja might try to set up, though Tapu Fini is prone to being worn down due to its lack of reliable recovery. Gastrodon is immune to Hydro Pump and takes less than 40% from Dark Pulse before Greninja transforms, but Stealth Rock and Spikes can put Gastrodon in range of a 2HKO from Dark Pulse.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Grass-types: As long as these Pokemon are alive, Greninja can't mindlessly spam its Water-type STAB moves. Specially Defensive Tapu Bulu resists both of Greninja's STAB types and OHKOes it in return with Horn Leech, however it should be wary of Ice Beam. Assault Vest Tangrowth takes very little damage from Dark Pulse and only takes around 50% from Ice Beam before Greninja transforms. Mega Venusaur takes very little damage from Greninja's STAB attacks and doesn't fear Ice Beam due to Thick Fat, although its reliance on the low-PP Synthesis for recovery and extreme vulnerability to Spikes means that it is easy to overwhelm.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Choice Scarf users such as Kartana and Garchomp are able to attack Ash-Greninja before it can move, although these Pokemon need to be careful of Water Shuriken. Tapu Koko outpaces Greninja before it transforms and can OHKO it with Thunderbolt or Volt Switch. Mega Alakazam and Mega Lopunny are capable of revenge killing Greninja post-transformation but are vulnerable to Water Shuriken if they have taken prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Transformation-prevention Strategies: Ultimately, Greninja isn't incredibly strong until it transforms; therefore, taking measures that prevent it from transforming, such as aggressive pivoting or packing Pokemon that take its attacks with ease before it transforms, are good ways of keeping it in check.</p> <p><strong>Strong, Unresisted Priority</strong>: Mega Pinsir poses a major threat with Quick Attack, as does Mega Medicham with Fake Out—however, a healthy Ash-Greninja can tank both. That said, a lot of common priority moves—namely Bullet Punch—are resisted by Greninja and, as such, don't faze it, and it can also ease matchups versus priority users with Water Shuriken.</p> <h1>Greninja</h1> <p><strong>Set-dependent Switch-ins: Greninja has no true, guaranteed switch-ins because of its expansive movepool. Given that it is limited to four moveslots, it can be countered or checked defensively if Greninja is not carrying the appropriate moveset or move. Toxapex and Mega Venusaur can wall Greninja if it lacks Extrasensory; Chansey can wall Greninja if it is not physically based and running Low Kick; Ferrothorn is a good answer for those lacking Hidden Power Fire; and Gastrodon will completely stop those lacking Hidden Power Grass. Assault Vest Magearna avoids the 2HKO from all of Greninja's moves, but is easily worn down due to its lack of recovery. Keldeo, while prone to residual wear and chip damage, can irritate Greninja lacking Extrasensory. Alomomola's massive HP stat allows it to avoid the 2HKO from a majority of its coverage moves, fearing only the rare Hidden Power Grass and Electric.</p> <p><strong>Naturally Faster Revenge Killers: Mega Alakazam, Tapu Koko, Mega Manectric, Mega Lopunny, and Weavile all outpace maximum Speed Greninja and can threaten it depending on its current typing.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Surf is a weaker, more accurate alternative to Hydro Pump that also sports more PP. It should be noted, though, that Greninja will struggle to pick up certain KOes without Hydro Pump. Spikes is an option that allows Greninja to punish the opponent's attempts to switch into defensive answers such as Toxapex, Tapu Bulu, and Magearna by pressuring their attempts to switch into Greninja later on in the match. Ice Beam deals super effective damage to the Grass-types that prevent Greninja from mindlessly spamming its Water-type STAB moves, being its strongest attack versus specially defensive Tapu Bulu and Assault Vest Tangrowth, but it is generally a subpar option, as it leaves Greninja with no good way to punish a switch into Toxapex or Assault Vest Magearna.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Battle Bond is what allows this set to function, giving Greninja the ability to transform into Ash-Greninja upon securing a KO. Choice Specs bolsters Greninja's firepower substantially without wearing it down over time, which is important for securing a safe transformation. Waterium Z can be used as a one-time nuke to blast through Pokemon such as Magearna, Tapu Lele, and Mega Mawile and a reliable way to clean without relying on the subpar accuracy of Hydro Pump. Waterium Z Ash-Greninja also retains the ability to switch moves. This does, however, significantly reduce Greninja's overall power, which can make it more difficult to KO a foe.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Unless the situation forces you to do so, do not use Water Shuriken if Greninja has not transformed because it is extremely weak, inconsistent, and easy to punish. If Greninja carries Spikes, the optimal time to use it is when you expect a Pokemon such as Toxapex, Tapu Bulu, Magearna, or anything else that takes very little from either of its STAB moves to switch into Greninja so that they can be more easily pressured later in the match. Try to play Greninja aggressively before transformation so that it is able to remove weakened targets in order to reap the benefits that Battle Bond brings. Bring Greninja in using a slow VoltTurn user or when a teammate faints, and generally try to avoid switching in directly unless it is absolutely necessary.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon that are able to eliminate Toxapex and Ferrothorn, such as Tapu Koko and Landorus-T for the former and Magnezone for the latter, make for useful teammates because Toxapex and Ferrothorn are major roadblocks to transformation. Magnezone helps create a particularly potent core, as Ferrothorn is one of the few Pokemon that can punish Ash-Greninja's attempts to use Spikes by using its own Spikes. Volcarona and Mega Pinsir make for solid teammates for the same reason, as they eliminate Assault Vest Tapu Bulu in addition to the aforementioned checks. Slow VoltTurn users like Mega Scizor, Landorus-T, and Rotom-W are useful for getting Ash-Greninja onto the field safely, with a special mention going to Pelipper due to Ash-Greninja being a powerful asset to rain teams with its brutally strong Hydro Pumps, lack of dependence on rain to maintain its excellent Speed tier, and powerful priority to ease matchups that rain teams otherwise struggle with, such as those against Mega Alakazam or Aurora Veil hyper offense. Entry hazards from Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Heatran, and Ferrothorn are useful to put bulky Pokemon under additional pressure, which Greninja appreciates both before and after transforming; similarly, wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele and Kartana are also capable of putting defensive Pokemon under heavy pressure to consequentially enhance Greninja's effectiveness.</p> "

Ice Beam is important to deal with Ground- and Dragon-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Mega Latios. Gunk Shot allows Greninja to pressure Tapu Fini, Rotom-W, and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Spikes is very useful to punish switches into Greninja's checks, but U-turn can also be run to gain momentum against them. Oftentimes, U-turn is also more useful on teams with another Spikes setter. Hydro Pump is an option that can be run over Ice Beam so that Greninja can pressure Heatran and Tyranitar without having to use Tectonic Rage while maintaining the ability to hit Landorus-T and Gliscor.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Hasty nature is preferred over a Naive nature to take hits from Heatran slightly better while not hindering Greninja's damage output.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>You should avoid using Tectonic Rage as soon as the opportunity arises, as players will often be wary of it and play around it. Instead, you should play proactively to punish their attempt at scouting for it by using Spikes or coverage moves. Because of its frailty, it's often hard for Greninja to switch into play directly. To mitigate this, you should aggressively switch it into play on forced switches or with VoltTurn support. When Greninja forces a switch, you should take advantage of that by setting up Spikes or using U-turn to generate momentum.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon such as Magearna, Clefable, and Mega Scizor, which can struggle against Toxapex, Magearna, and Heatran, benefit greatly from Greninja's ability to lure in and beat them. On top of that, Greninja's Spikes can make them much more annoying to switch into. Other Pokemon like Gliscor, Mega Latias, and Mega Alakazam also appreciate Greninja's Spikes support. Pivots such as Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and Magearna are useful teammates because they give Greninja an easier time to switch into play.

Gunk Shot is useful for hitting Grass-types that commonly attempt to pivot into Greninja like Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth as well as Fairy-types like Tapu Lele, Clefable, and Tapu Fini. It also gives Greninja a better matchup against Rotom-W thanks to the poison chance. Alternatively, Ice Beam can be used over Gunk Shot to give Greninja a better matchup against Mega Latias and Mega Latios, which can cause issues if Greninja lacks Dark Pulse. Hidden Power Fire allows Greninja to dent Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Assault Vest Magearna, two common Pokemon used to check Greninja. Hidden Power Fire also ensures that Greninja beats Mega Scizor without having to waste its Z-Move or rely on Hydro Pump's accuracy. Spikes is a great utility move due to the number of switches Greninja forces in addition to Greninja's ability to beat common Defog users; it also weakens some of its common switch-ins, such as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Assault Vest Magearna. U-turn can be used to ease prediction and gain momentum against anything that attempts to switch into Greninja. Extrasensory allows Greninja to beat Toxapex, one of this set's hardest counters, with the help of Metronome. Lastly, Dark Pulse pairs nicely with Metronome, allowing Greninja to muscle through Psychic-type Calm Mind users such as Reuniclus and Mega Latias.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Waterium Z is used as a nuke to guarantee the OHKO on Pokemon such as Mega Medicham and Mega Mawile, and it also guarantees the KO on Zapdos with Hydro Vortex + Hydro Pump. If running a special attack over Gunk Shot, a Timid nature should be used. Metronome is an interesting option to gradually build up damage against Pokemon that try to wall Greninja, such as Magearna and Clefable, but it doesn't possess Waterium Z's attacking power.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Take advantage of Greninja's ability to hit a vast amount of the metagame for super effective damage to weaken popular defensive cores consisting of Pokemon such as Heatran, Tapu Bulu, and Clefable. Attempt to set up Spikes as early as possible on expected switches to weaken Greninja's switch-ins throughout the game, giving them fewer opportunities to switch in. Try to save Greninja's Hydro Vortex for a scenario where an OHKO is guaranteed instead of prematurely wasting it early-game. Due to Greninja's vast movepool and flexibility, bluffing a Choice Scarf set can let you surprise opponents that think Greninja is Choice-locked with Hydro Vortex or a super effective coverage move. However, Greninja's subpar bulk means it struggles to come in even on resisted hits, so attempt to bring it in on predicted double switches or through VoltTurn support.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Due to the number of switches Greninja forces, having a teammate to set up Stealth Rock is greatly beneficial to form a hazard-stacking core. Heatran, Clefable, and Landorus-T can all reliably set up Stealth Rock and fit on the offensive and balanced teams that Greninja finds itself on. Pokemon that can exert a lot of offensive pressure and appreciate Spikes support make for good partners. Mega Alakazam and Mega Mawile deserve special mentions, as they both appreciate residual damage from Spikes and possess good offensive synergy with Greninja. Similarly, powerful attackers like Magearna and Choice Specs Tapu Lele appreciate their checks being weakened by Spikes. Toxapex walls this set with ease if Greninja is not running Extrasensory, so having strong Psychic- and Ground-types like Mega Alakazam, Tapu Lele, and Landorus-T that can threaten it is helpful. Mega Alakazam and Tapu Koko both outspeed and threaten to OHKO Greninja, so having a way to handle them is crucial. Choice Scarf Landorus-T can outspeed and threaten Mega Alakazam with U-turn and Tapu Koko with Earthquake. Mega Scizor, Landorus-T, and Tapu Koko can all pivot Greninja in safely, with Mega Scizor luring in Heatran, Landorus-T luring in opposing Landorus-T, and Tapu Koko luring in bulky Ground-types, all of which Greninja can take advantage of.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rock Slide allows Greninja to revenge kill dangerous offensive sweepers such as Volcarona and Gyarados. U-turn is a great move to gain momentum on the Pokemon that Greninja naturally threatens, such as Landorus-T and Heatran. Ice Beam OHKOes Landorus-T and Garchomp and hits Zapdos harder than any other move on the set. Gunk Shot is preferred in the last slot to hit Tangrowth, as well as OHKOing Tapu Bulu, Tapu Koko, and Tapu Lele and 2HKOing Tapu Fini. Another option is Low Kick, which OHKOes both regular and Mega Tyranitar, as well as netting coverage against Bisharp, Terrakion, and Magnezone. Spikes is also an option, as Greninja's high Speed usually allows it to get up a layer of Spikes in most games. Hydro Pump is an alternate option that gets boosted by rain, is Greninja's strongest viable option against Shift Gear Magearna, and has decent neutral coverage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The Speed investment allows Greninja to hit as hard and as fast as possible. Hasty is the preferred nature to maximize Ice Beam's damage output while letting Greninja handle opposing Ash-Greninja, though Naive can be used to improve Greninja's ability to handle other priority moves. The given Special Attack EVs are to OHKO Kartana with Ice Beam, and the remaining EVs are put into Attack. Protean gives Greninja STAB on every move that it uses and makes it an effective revenge killer.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Hard switching Greninja into attacks is not recommended, as it's very frail and gets worn down easily from entry hazards. Choice Scarf Greninja is best used as a revenge killer of boosting Pokemon such as Volcarona and Gyarados. While Greninja can't actually switch into any boosting Pokemon, it can revenge kill them with the appropriate coverage move. U-turn is often a solid move to use against the Pokemon that it naturally forces out, such as Landorus-T and Heatran, so use it often to gain momentum. Use Gunk Shot and Ice Beam on targets such as Tangrowth and Zapdos, which usually check Greninja, that might be lured in; if running it, use Low Kick against Pokemon such as Tyranitar and Bisharp.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Greninja set can't do much to walls such as Chansey and Skarmory; as such, strong wallbreakers that can advantage of the momentum and free switches that U-turn provides, such as Swords Dance Landorus-T, Mega Pinsir, Mega Medicham, and Hoopa-U, make for good teammates. Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu and Ferrothorn that appreciate Greninja's ability to revenge kill setup sweepers also make for good teammates, as they're setup bait for Volcarona and, to a lesser extent, Supersonic Skystrike Gyarados. Choice Scarf Greninja also appreciates defensive Pokemon that can make up for its lackluster defenses, so Pokemon such as Assault Vest Tangrowth, Landorus-T, and Latios also make for good teammates.</p> "

        "name": "Dual Hazards",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Greninja's blistering Speed allows it to perform as an excellent Spikes user, and when holding a Focus Sash it is capable of setting up at least one layer of the hazard every game. This lets its teammates apply pressure on the opposing team thanks to the residual damage dealt to grounded foes on the switch in. Spikes is especially useful against foes that lack reliable recovery like Assault Vest Magearna, as they have a hard time switching in with Spikes up. Toxic Spikes, on the other hand, poisons grounded foes on the switch in and slowly stacks damage on bulkier teams that lack a grounded Poison-type. Some notable targets are Tangrowth, Mew, and Tapu Bulu. Taunt prevents Defog from the likes of Mega Scizor and Mew, which otherwise wall Greninja and prevent it from setting up hazards. Taunt also prevents setup from the likes of Shift Gear Calm Mind Magearna and Dragon Dance Gyarados and can even stop opposing hazards from setters like Heatran and Ferrothorn if timed correctly, though this comes at the risk of Greninja setting up fewer layers. Ice Beam is Greninja's only attacking move and provides Greninja with useful coverage against some Defog users like Zapdos and Latios, and it OHKOes Landorus-T and Garchomp. Hidden Power Fire is usable over Toxic Spikes to deal with Swords Dance Mega Scizor, normally a big threat to hyper offense. Gunk Shot is an option instead of Ice Beam to surprise Taunt Tapu Koko and stop it from preventing Spikes and to also hit Tapu Fini for super effective damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature gives Greninja as much Speed as possible, notably outpacing Latios, Kartana, and Garchomp. Maximum Special Attack investment powers up Greninja's Ice Beam for a chance to OHKO Zapdos after Stealth Rock damage and gives it decent overall damage. A Jolly nature alongside maximum Attack investment should be used instead if running Gunk Shot. Focus Sash is needed in order for Greninja to survive any hit with 1 HP, thus guaranteeing at least one layer of Spikes or Toxic Spikes per game. Protean is the best ability for this set, as it gives Ice Beam the needed STAB boost and can even force mind games with Spikes.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Greninja does a great job at setting up Spikes early-game on offense teams and throughout a match on balance ones. When used on offense, Greninja should be either led with or sent out after the Stealth Rock user to set up as many layers of Spikes and Toxic Spikes as possible and then faint. In order to maximize the amount of hazards it sets up in a game, Greninja should try to get into the field against passive Pokemon or Pokemon it forces out such as Celesteela, Toxapex, and Landorus-T. If the opponent lacks a Toxic Spikes absorber like Toxapex or Mega Venusaur and a majority of the opposing team is vulnerable to the hazard, Greninja should prioritize setting up Toxic Spikes as opposed to Spikes, though it should aim to set both up if possible. If the opponent sends out a Defog user that doesn't fear Ice Beam like Mega Scizor or Mew, Greninja should make use of Taunt to prevent them from removing the hazards even if Greninja sacrifices itself in the process, though balance teams can afford to switch Greninja out and find another opportunity to set up hazards.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Another suicide lead with Stealth Rock like Focus Sash Excadrill or Landorus-T complements Greninja and forms a deadly double hazard core with it. Alternatively, other Stealth Rock users like defensive Landorus-T and Clefable pair well with Greninja on bulkier teams, where it shines due to its ability to pivot in and set up hazards multiple times against balance teams. This set excels when paired with teammates that can apply offensive pressure on the opposing team and prevent members of it from getting rid of the hazards, or teammates that can take advantage of opposing Defog to set up. Wallbreakers like Choice Specs Tapu Lele and sweepers like Swords Dance Scizor and Mimikyu can fulfill this role and are great on offense, and they have good synergy with Spikes since some of their checks like Assault Vest Magearna and Toxapex are grounded. Other bulky setup sweepers like Shift Gear Calm Mind Magearna and Dragon Dance Mega Gyarados appreciate Spikes too and can stack poison damage thanks to the many switches they force.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Diggersby isn't necessarily a bad wallbreaker; in fact, it's actually quite difficult to switch into. Its main issue, however, is that it faces immense competition from other wallbreakers such as Mega Medicham, Mega Mawile, and even Hoopa-U. Diggersby's below average Speed stat and subpar defensive typing leave it very vulnerable to common offensive threats such as Greninja, Kartana, and Kyurem-B. Its mediocre bulk is also problematic because anything it fails to OHKO will most likely deal a heavy amount of damage to it, so it will often be dead weight against offensive teams. Overall, Diggersby has almost nothing to distinguish itself from the plethora of other wallbreakers in the tier, and there's just very little reason to use it over something else.</p> ",

Diggersby can force a decent amount of switches against bulkier teams, so it should have plenty of opportunities to lay Spikes down, giving it a slight niche over other wallbreakers. Alternatively, Fire Punch provides valuable coverage against Celesteela which resists both of its STAB moves, as well as OHKOes Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Kartana. Foul Play is boosted by Huge Power, so it's also an option for dealing solid neutral damage to most of the tier, although it provides no real coverage.</p> "}],

  "Zygarde-10%": {
    "overview": "<p>Zygarde-10% is a niche wallbreaker in OU due to its access to a great move in Thousand Arrows, which differentiates it from other Ground-types by enabling it to immediately pressure traditional Ground checks like Celesteela, Rotom-W, and Skarmory without relying on a Z-Move, making it less exploitable. It also has a great Speed stat, allowing it to outspeed Kartana, Mega Latias, and Garchomp. One major downfall is its terrible bulk, meaning it is revenged killed easily and will usually be KOed if it doesn't KO the foe. Its average Attack stat doesn't help with this, as its damage output will not be remarkable and it will, therefore, have to rely quite heavily on Spikes support in order to break bulkier teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Superpower is an option to deal major damage to Ferrothorn and Choice Scarf Kartana, which can otherwise stomach a hit and KO Zygarde-10%, but most Superpower targets are vulnerable to Spikes damage and Thousand Arrows, and Zygarde-10% will have to give up the ability to pressure Fairy-types or Tangrowth.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu are two of Zygarde-10%'s best checks, although Assault Vest Tangrowth should look out for Outrage, which has a high chance to 2HKO it from full, Tapu Bulu should be careful of Iron Tail, and both are crippled by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Albeit not as effective as Grass-types, as most of them fail to take Thousand Arrows safely, Clefable and Tapu Fini are bulky enough to sponge a hit and retalitate with Moonblast. All of them can take advantage of a Zygarde-10% that is locked into Outrage, or even Extreme Speed in Tapu Lele’s case.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon: Landorus-T, Slowbro, Mega Scizor, and Buzzwole can all stomach several Thousand Arrows and deal significant amounts of damage to Zygarde-10%.

Mega Scizor and Mega Mawile resist Extreme Speed, while Mega Lopunny and Mega Medicham can outpace even Extreme Speed with Fake Out.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thousand Arrows is instrumental for Zygarde-10% to pressure Pokemon like Celesteela and Rotom-W. Iron Tail targets Fairy-types like Tapu Bulu and Clefable for super effective damage. Toxic gives up the ability to immediately 2HKO Fairy-types like Tapu Bulu and Clefable for crippling bulky Ground-, Grass-, and Water-type switch-ins like Landorus-T, Tangrowth, Hippowdon, and Slowbro, making them less consistent switch-ins. Glare can also be used to paralyze checks like Landorus-T, Mega Scizor, and Tangrowth, allowing you to play more aggressively against them.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Jolly nature is preferred to outspeed Garchomp and Mega Latias.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It is important to get Spikes up early, as this will enable Zygarde-10% to pressure grounded checks like Tapu Bulu and Mega Scizor, forcing them to recover more often and therefore giving you an advantage in momentum. It is also great because most of the Defoggers, like Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Rotom-W, fail to reliably remove these Spikes without taking a considerable amount of damage. Make sure to use Outrage only when Fairy- and Steel-types are eliminated or if sacrificing Zygarde-10% to said Pokemon is affordable after nabbing a KO. When there are several Zygarde-10% checks or Pokemon that resist Ground on the opposing team, it is always a good idea to scout for their reaction to Zygarde-10%. For example, if the opponent has both a Slowbro and Tapu Bulu, you should be using Thousand Arrows to scout which one of these checks are going for, instead of immediately clicking Iron Tail, so Zygarde-10% will be able to break past Tapu Bulu later. Zygarde-10% should also be used aggressively in this kind of matchup where multiple checks are present, or else it will not do much at all. This cannot be said of its status moves, however, as using these can open up opportunities for Zygarde-10% or its teammates to break through teams more easily. Pokemon that are immune to Toxic or Glare are often forced out or cannot come in on Zygarde-10% anyway. Take note that Pokemon with Protect, mainly Celesteela, can scout for whether you go for Thousand Arrows or a status move and switch accordingly. One should be mindful when revenge killing a Pokemon with Extreme Speed, as the move is relatively weak and can give a foe like Shift Gear Magearna or Choice Specs Tapu Lele an opening to set up or throw out a powerful hit, which is quite annoying, as the relatively offensive builds Zygarde-10% typically fits on may get severely weakened if it gives the opponent a free turn. Against offensive teams, use Thousand Arrows whenever Zygarde-10% gets on the field. Many of these teams will struggle to consistently switch into it, as their many defensive pivots, including Landorus-T, Tapu Fini, and Ferrothorn, are all extremely vulnerable to it. Even those with Tangrowth or Tapu Bulu can be easily overwhelmed if Zygarde-10% is running Toxic, which can even allow another teammate to clean up when these Grass-types have been weakened by poison.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Zygarde-10% fits best on offensive teams, where it can come in through pivot support from the likes of Magearna and Tornadus-T and throw out a powerful hit or cripple a Pokemon with status. These teams will aim to constantly pressure defensive checks through VoltTurn and stacking multiple threats that have similar checks. Entry hazards, especially Spikes, are essential in helping Zygarde-10% wear down checks like Tangrowth and Mega Scizor and make it quite difficult to play around, and most Spikes-immune Pokemon are pressured by Thousand Arrows. Ferrothorn and Ash-Greninja are amazing Spikes users along Zygarde-10%, as Ferrothorn can check many Grass- and Fairy-types while enjoying Zygarde-10%'s ability to pressure opposing Steel-types, while Ash-Greninja can form a core to overwhelm Grass-types and pressure physically defensive checks to Zygarde-10%. Most offensive teams also struggle to safely switch into Zygarde-10%'s Thousand Arrows as well, as their Ground-type check is often neutral to it. Entry hazard control is also important as Zygarde-10% usually wants to keep out of revenge killers' KO range. Tornadus-T and Landorus-T are good options, as they can Defog away entry hazards and provide pivoting support while luring out their checks, which are mostly pressured by Zygarde-10%. Pokemon that are also checked by Grass-types like the aforementioned Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Serperior are good partners, as they can pressure Grass-types into recovering more often in order to check both threats. Additionally, Ash-Greninja can set up Spikes and revenge kill Kartana and Mega Mawile, Tapu Koko is able to pivot around and check Tornadus-T, and Serperior enjoys many of its checks being pressured and forms a Glare spam core with Zygarde-10%. Psychic- and Fairy-types like Mega Alakazam, Reuniclus, and Magearna appreciate Steel-types and, in Magearna’s case, Toxapex being pressured, and in return they can take advantage of some of Zygarde-10%’s checks like Slowbro and Tangrowth to set up or throw out a powerful hit.</p> "

The Defoggers that do match up well against Mega Diancie, namely Rotom-W and Tapu Fini, lack reliable recovery, so it's very easy for it to wear them down. Mega Diancie has a decent defensive typing that allows it to check prominent threats such as Tornadus-T and Volcarona to an extent. However, this typing in conjunction with Mega Diancie's poor bulk leaves it threatened by many Pokemon that outspeed it such as Greninja, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Tapu Koko.

Endeavor can be used to surprise Chansey for teammates that appreciate the defensive behemoth removed, but it's usually much too situational to justify using over a coverage move. Finally, Mega Diancie can have a pseudo-suicide lead set with Stealth Rock and Explosion to deny Defog and provide offensive momentum as well as to act as a surprise factor against Pokemon such as Toxapex early-game, but it's much less consistent in longer games and makes it much harder to deny entry hazards from the opposing side in the long run.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Bulky Steel-types such as Assault Vest Magearna, Celesteela, and Jirachi can switch into and threaten to OHKO Mega Diancie, but they have to be wary of switching into Mega Diancie too often and accruing too much chip damage.

On the other hand, Greninja can outspeed Mega Diancie and threaten to OHKO it with either Surf or Hydro Pump, but it cannot switch directly into Mega Diancie.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earth Power is an excellent coverage move, allowing Mega Diancie to hit Steel-types like Magearna and Heatran as well as Toxapex. Protect can be used in place of Stealth Rock or Diamond Storm in order to allow Diancie the ability to scout Choice-locked Pokemon, such as Landorus-T, Ash-Greninja, and Kartana, that Mega Diancie would otherwise be forced out by. In a similar vein, Protect allows Mega Diancie to scout for potential Z-Moves, such as Tapu Koko's Gigavolt Havoc and Magearna's Twinkle Tackle. Hidden Power Fire is an alternative option that allows Mega Diancie to hit Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn significantly harder, but it has trouble fitting it onto its already constricted moveset.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Diancie uses a Hasty nature because the drop in its special bulk from running Naive makes it a significantly less reliable check to Tornadus-T and leaves it OHKOed by Tapu Lele; however, if Diamond Storm is dropped in favor of Protect or another coverage move, Mega Diancie should utilize a Timid nature.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Due to Mega Diancie's ability to beat virtually every method of hazard control in the tier, attempt to get up Stealth Rock early in the game, as it pressures many of its common checks. This is especially important against stall teams, particularly those with Mega Sableye, because having entry hazards up against them makes it significantly easier to break through them. However, Mega Diancie should take care when playing against stall with specially defensive Mew, as it needs to be chipped before Mega Diancie threatens to 2HKO it. If using Protect, use it against Pokemon that commonly get Choice-locked, such as Greninja and Landorus-T, to scout what move they are using, and then make your move accordingly. However, be wary of Pokemon that are bluffing a Choice item, such as Kartana and Landorus-T, and scout to make sure that they have a Choice item early-game. Use Mega Diancie as a breaker, weakening defensive Pokemon like Magearna and Tapu Fini that are commonly used as defensive answers for Mega Diancie for teammates to clean late-game. Don't be afraid to use Mega Diancie to aggressively deny entry hazards when you can afford the risk, as keeping them off of the field can be the difference between losing and winning in many matchups.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Generally, Mega Diancie fits into more offensive teams that need the role compression between being both a Stealth Rock setter and a wallbreaker that can threaten balance teams. As is the case with most Stealth Rock setters, but with Mega Diancie especially because it can set up Stealth Rock against the best hazard control in the tier, wallbreakers that are aided by entry hazards such as Kyurem, Tapu Lele, and Kartana make good partners for Mega Diancie, especially because it can weaken Steel-types with Earth Power. Magnezone is an excellent partner for Earth Power Mega Diancie, being able to remove troublesome Pokemon such as Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor. Offensive Pokemon that appreciate Mega Diancie's ability to discourage Stealth Rock, such as Tornadus-T and Volcarona, make great partners for Mega Diancie. Those two in particular are good partners because they have good defensive synergy with Mega Diancie and deal with Choice-locked Kartana particularly well in conjunction with Protect Mega Diancie.</p> "

Z-Trick gives Hoopa-U +2 Speed, which is useful against offensive teams, allowing it to serve as a great cleaner, and it also allows Hoopa-U to utilize Shattered Psyche with Psyshock; Z-Snatch serves the same purpose while allowing Hoopa-U to alternatively use Black Hole Eclipse if needed. Moves like Zen Headbutt, Ice Punch, and Trick could be used on the Choice Band set; however, they tend to be outclassed by the moves already listed.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Threats: Faster threats like Greninja, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Koko all threaten to outspeed and OHKO Hoopa-U due to its very poor Defense; U-turn users in general deserve a mention due to Hoopa-U's 4x weakness, as the U-turn user will force it out and always gain momentum.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types such as Magearna, Mega Mawile, Tapu Fini, and Tapu Koko resist Hoopa-U's Dark-type STAB moves and can respond back with a strong super effective Fairy-type move or U-turn in the case of Tapu Koko. Assault Vest Magearna, while it does not have any recovery, is able to stomach just about all of Hoopa-U's hits from full and can respond back with a STAB Fleur Cannon, which can OHKO Hoopa-U.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: While they do not appreciate taking any of Hoopa-U's Fighting-type coverage options such as Drain Punch and Focus Blast, Tyranitar, Weavile, and Alolan Muk resist Dark, are immune to Hoopa-U's STAB Psychic-type moves, and can threaten Hoopa-U with Pursuit or a strong STAB-boosted Dark-type move in Crunch or Knock Off, removing Hoopa-U's item. Pursuit users in general can take advantage of Hoopa-U Choice-locked into Hyperspace Fury due to the Defense drops accumulated from the move. Mega Tyranitar has high enough bulk to take all of Hoopa-U's attacks aside from Drain Punch and Focus Blast and potentially set up on it with Dragon Dance.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hyperspace Fury gives Hoopa-U great overall coverage due to the lack of Pokemon that resist it and its great power, netting 2HKOs on defensive threats such as Mega Sableye, Skarmory, and Toxapex. Gunk Shot lets Hoopa-U hit Fairy-types that resist Hyperspace Fury such as Tapu Fini, Clefable, and Tapu Koko while also netting coverage against Tangrowth, which can take the rest of Hoopa-U's attacks with a physically defensive set. Fire Punch allows Hoopa-U to hit Magearna, Mega Mawile, Ferrothorn, Mega Heracross, and Mega Scizor all in one slot. Drain Punch allows Hoopa-U to hit Dark-types such as Tyranitar, which can take the rest of its moves, while also healing off any residual damage Hoopa-U has taken during the match.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>32 HP EVs ensure Hoopa-U always takes two Focus Blasts from Mega Alakazam from full health. Maximum Speed investment alongside a Jolly nature lets Hoopa-U outspeed Adamant Landorus-T and Gliscor most importantly, but it also lets Hoopa-U outspeed Timid Heatran, Jolly Tapu Bulu, and neutral Mega Garchomp; an Adamant nature is not needed due to Hoopa-U's already great power.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Due to Hoopa-U's frailty, it finds difficulty switching directly into threats aside from passive Pokemon and weak special attackers such as Toxapex, Zapdos, and Chansey; still, beware Scald burns, which can cripple this set. It is then best to bring Hoopa-U into the match after a partner has fainted or by the assistance of Volt Switch and U-turn users like Rotom-W, Tapu Koko, and Landorus-T. Hyperspace Fury is Hoopa-U's most spammable move due to the lack of Pokemon that resist it and its great power backed up by a STAB boost. Its other coverage options can be used when predicting an opponent's switch to a threat that checks Hoopa-U; for example, using Gunk Shot on a predicted Tapu Fini or Tapu Koko or Fire Punch on a predicted Magearna switch-in allows Hoopa-U to retain momentum for its team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Volt Switch and U-turn users are necessary to bring Hoopa-U safely into the match; some examples include Tapu Koko, Mega Scizor, and Landorus-T. Spikes Greninja pairs well with this set, as it appreciates Hoopa-U's ability to weaken Mega Sableye and Chansey with a Choice Band-boosted Hyperspace Fury to find more opportunities to set up Spikes. Heatran can assist Hoopa-U in breaking defensive builds and can set up Stealth Rock while also checking the Fairy-types that Hoopa-U has difficulty dealing with such as Tapu Lele. Given that Hoopa-U is a prime target for opposing Volt Switch and U-turn users, partners that deter the use of these moves such as Rocky Helmet Landorus-T and Ferrothorn partner well with Hoopa-U.</p> "

        "name": "Nasty Plot",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Foremost, Nasty Plot is an effective setup move that allows Hoopa-U to break through its normal checks and threaten to sweep through balanced teams altogether. Dark Pulse is a strong, reliable STAB move with very few sturdy switch-ins in OU and can decimate the vast majority of balanced teams bar one or two Pokemon. Psychic is a solid secondary STAB move that can hit Dark-type switch-ins such as Mega Lopunny and Keldeo while also hitting Toxapex significantly harder. Alternatively, Psyshock can be used if Hoopa-U is holding Darkinium Z because it allows it to more reliably beat Chansey and Magearna, as Hoopa-U lacks All-Out Pummeling to break through them. Focus Blast is an excellent coverage move that allows Hoopa-U to hit Dark-types like Tyranitar that would otherwise wall this set.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Timid nature alongside full Speed investment allows Hoopa-U to outspeed key threats like Adamant Landorus-T and Gliscor, but it also lets Hoopa-U get the jump on Timid Heatran, Jolly Tapu Bulu, and neutral Mega Garchomp. Fightinium Z is usually the best option on this set to enable Hoopa-U to more reliably take out Chansey and offensive Magearna and do large amounts of damage to Assault Vest Magearna. However, Darkinium Z is still a fine option to be able to guarantee an OHKO on defensive Landorus-T and still OHKO the Steel-types that All-Out Pummeling breaks through, bar Magearna.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Most importantly, as a breaker with Nasty Plot, Hoopa-U needs to remain relatively healthy in order to survive potentially important attacks late-game such as Clefable's Moonblast, so it should be brought in via free switches or VoltTurn support in order to conserve its HP. Ideally, Hoopa-U should be brought in on passive special attackers such as Toxapex that offer relatively risk-free setup so that you can either fire off an attack or get a Nasty Plot off depending on the opposing team. Avoid setting up unless you're sure that the opposing Pokemon cannot harm Hoopa-U or in game-changing scenarios when you're sure they're going to switch out because Hoopa-U is fairly frail and easy to KO for the most part. Conserve Hoopa-U's Z-Move unless your team can significantly benefit from heavily weakening an opposing threat, such as when you have an Ash-Greninja as a teammate versus an Assault Vest Magearna and your opponent has no other Ash-Greninja switch-in. Finally, take into account the opposing team's structure when deciding whether to set up or attack. For example, it's usually better to spam attacks vs offensive teams due to them having a multitude of ways to revenge kill Hoopa-U, whereas setting up Nasty Plot versus defensive teams can potentially net you multiple KOs depending on the team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>First and foremost, VoltTurn support from Pokemon such as Rotom-W, defensive Landorus-T, and Assault Vest Magearna is greatly appreciated, as it allows Hoopa-U more opportunities to wallbreak for teammates. Additionally, late-game cleaners such as Shift Gear Magearna, Dragon Dance Mega Gyarados, and Kartana that benefit from Hoopa-U's ability to break down common walls make excellent teammates. Ash-Greninja is a fantastic teammate in particular because it shares several checks with Hoopa-U and can pressure shared answers with Spikes support. In a similar vein, Pokemon that can exert pressure on Assault Vest Magearna such as Choice Specs Tapu Koko assist Nasty Plot Hoopa-U in being able to break through one of its best defensive answers. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Heatran can help punish the many switches that Hoopa-U forces and wears down the opposing team. Finally, entry hazard control from teammates such as Defog Rotom-W is appreciated so that Hoopa-U can stay healthy throughout the game in order to live attacks from more passive Pokemon as mentioned earlier.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dark Pulse is Hoopa-U's most spammable STAB move; when it's coming off of a Choice Specs boost along with Hoopa-U's exceptional Special Attack stat, there are very few defensive Pokemon that can stomach this attack. Psyshock is its other STAB attack, which is preferred over Psychic in order to hit Chansey on its weaker physical Defense stat while netting coverage against threats such as Volcarona, Mega Heracross, Toxapex, and Tapu Koko. Focus Blast provides great coverage in combination with Dark Pulse, hitting numerous Steel- and Dark-types that could otherwise stomach Hoopa-U's STAB combination such as Magearna, Tyranitar, Alolan Muk, and Mega Mawile. Trick allows Hoopa-U to shut down a defensive threat such as Chansey as well as alleviate prediction against defensive builds. Thunderbolt rounds out Hoopa-U's coverage to allow it to hit a majority of the metagame, and it is Hoopa-U's safest option to hit Tapu Fini, Azumarill, and Greninja along with the majority of Water-types in the tier.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>32 HP EVs enable Hoopa-U to stomach two Focus Blasts from Mega Alakazam. Timid is the nature of choice due to Hoopa-U's decent Speed tier, allowing it to outspeed Gliscor, Adamant Landorus-T, Jolly Tapu Bulu, Timid Heatran, and neutral-natured Mega Garchomp. A Modest nature is not necessary, since Hoopa-U nets the 2HKOs and OHKOs that it needs to with a Timid nature. Magician is Hoopa-U's only ability and has very situational uses, such as removing Assault Vest from Tangrowth after switching into its Knock Off.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It is best to bring Hoopa-U in on double switches or by assistance of a Volt Switch or U-turn user such as Tapu Koko. Hoopa-U can also switch in on defensive threats that cannot immediately threaten it out, such as Toxapex. While it can use its great Special Defense stat to switch in on predicted special attacks such as Choice Scarf Keldeo's Surf or Scald, be careful, since it can also get hit by Secret Sword or get too worn down due to repeatedly switching in along with potential Stealth Rock damage. Dark Pulse is generally the safest move to go for due to its phenomenal coverage. It is safe to use its coverage options on a predicted switch, such as using Focus Blast on a predicted Mega Mawile or Magearna switch-in, as hitting it will wear it down to the point where it cannot switch in again on Hoopa-U later on in the match. Hoopa-U must watch out for faster offensive threats, specifically physical attackers or those with U-turn that can easily gain momentum on it such as Tapu Koko. When against defensive teams like stall, you can predict the designated switch-ins such as Chansey and go for Psyshock, which 2HKOes.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Due to the great number of faster offensive checks to Hoopa-U that exist in the tier, partners to take care of these threats ease the pressure on Hoopa-U. Rocky Helmet Landorus-T can dissuade U-turn from the likes of opposing Landorus-T and Tapu Koko, although it must watch out for Hidden Power Ice from these two. Checks to Fairy-types such as Tapu Fini and Tapu Lele pair well with Hoopa-U; Steel-types such as Heatran can take care of Tapu Lele while also luring in Tapu Fini and taking it out with Bloom Doom; Heatran can also set up Stealth Rock for Hoopa-U to allow it to serve as a greater threat towards defensive teams. Teammates with U-turn or Volt Switch can easily get Hoopa-U in so that it does not have to risk coming in on an attack that can take it out; Tapu Koko, Landorus-T, Rotom-W, and U-turn Ash-Greninja can force switches to bring Hoopa-U in safely.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Volcanion's great offensive typing and high Special Attack stat make it a solid balance breaker. Water Absorb allows it to take full advantage of Toxapex, a staple on many balance teams, as well as pressure offensive Water-types such as Greninja and Keldeo. Volcanion also has access to a unique and powerful move in Steam Eruption, which is very hard to reliably switch into due to its high Base Power and 30% burn chance. Unfortunately, Volcanion's mediocre Speed stat puts it below most offensive Pokemon, such as Landorus-T, Tapu Bulu, and even Mega Tyranitar, and its vulnerability to entry hazards is also a huge problem because it heavily limits the number of times it can come in safely. Lastly, Volcanion faces a lot of competition from many other balance breakers, such as Kyurem-B, Kartana, Heatran, and Hoopa-U.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choice Specs set can be used to take advantage of Volcanion's excellent offensive typing and STAB attacks, but it requires a decent amount of prediction and can't effectively break teams because of this. Grassium Z with Solar Beam can be used to KO the bulky Water-types that Volcanion lures in such as Gastrodon, Suicune, and Alomomola. Toxic is another alternative to cripple bulky Water-types, but it doesn't fit anywhere on the set. Hidden Power Electric can 2HKO Mantine and Pelipper.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey completely walls Volcanion because of its insanely high Special Defense and can use Seismic Toss on Volcanion until it is KOed.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Gastrodon is quite possibly the best switch-in to Volcanion in the tier because it's immune to Steam Eruption, takes little damage from its other moves, and can threaten it out with Earthquake. Tapu Fini can use Taunt on Volcanion and prevent it from using Substitute, while Nature's Madness chips it considerably. Suicune can't touch Volcanion but can easily stall out its moves with its Pressure ability, and Mantine also stalls out Volcanion and is immune to Steam Eruption. Mega Slowbro resists both of Volcanion's STAB moves and sets up Calm Mind on it. Alomomola is hard to take down too due to Wish and Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Latios resists both of Volcanion's STAB moves and can simply use Roost to heal off the damage or threaten it with Draco Meteor. Mega Latias can use Volcanion as setup fodder. Dragonite has to be wary of being burned by Steam Eruption but otherwise can use Volcanion as setup fodder as well.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon: Volcanion is pretty slow, so a large portion of offensive Pokemon such as Mega Diancie, Tapu Koko, Landorus-T, and Tapu Lele can threaten it out.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Substitute allows Volcanion to take advantage of many passive, defensive Pokemon found on balance teams, such as Ferrothorn, Mew, Clefable, and Toxapex. It also eases prediction and protects Volcanion from status and revenge killers. Steam Eruption is very spammable due to its high Base Power and accuracy as well as its burn chance. It can be very useful for burning Pokemon such as Mew and Mega Venusaur that may try to stall out Volcanion. Flamethrower hits most of the Grass-types that resist Steam Eruption, such as Tangrowth, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Bulu. Fire Blast is a stronger alternative, but due to its low accuracy and PP, Flamethrower is preferred. Earth Power is an imperative coverage move for Toxapex, which walls Volcanion otherwise.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment allows Volcanion to hit as hard as possible, while maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature are important to outspeed Timid Magearna and Adamant Tapu Bulu. Leftovers is the optimal item choice because it lets Volcanion use Substitute more frequently and can also help offset entry hazard damage a bit. Waterium Z is also a fine option because it lets Volcanion break balance better by blasting through Clefable and Mew, as well as just hitting very hard in general. Groundium Z can be used to break through specially defensive Toxapex a lot faster without having to rely so much on Special Defense drops. Shuca Berry is a nice surprise for offensive Landorus-T as well as Heatran.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Bring Volcanion directly into passive Pokemon that can't really threaten it, such as Toxapex, Mew, Clefable, and Ferrothorn. If choosing to hard switch into Toxapex, make sure Toxic Spikes aren't present on your side of the field, as otherwise Volcanion can be stalled out by Toxapex. Use Substitute as much as possible against balanced teams if Volcanion can afford to, because these teams usually struggle to deal with it behind a Substitute. Against offensive teams, it's usually best to just spam Steam Eruption on whatever comes in and only get Volcanion in on free switches via momentum. Try not to hard switch Volcanion into a predicted Hydro Pump or Scald from Greninja or Keldeo, because if you are incorrect, Volcanion is going to take a lot of unnecessary damage. If attempting to burn something with Steam Eruption, be wary of its low PP because Pokemon like Mew can potentially stall out Volcanion with Soft-Boiled otherwise.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard removal is imperative, because otherwise Volcanion is going to take a lot of damage from Stealth Rock and Spikes, and Toxic Spikes render it useless. Latios is a great option that can also switch into offensive Landorus-T somewhat reliably, as well as help with Mega Venusaur, which walls Volcanion. Mew and Kartana are also great options that can fit on a wide variety of teams. Tapu Koko provides momentum with Volt Switch and also baits in Pokemon such as Ferrothorn and Tangrowth, which Volcanion can usually force out and set up a Substitute on. Pokemon that can clean up after Volcanion busts through balance cores are useful, such as Shift Gear Magearna and Ash-Greninja, which also baits in Toxapex. Pursuit trappers such as Mega Tyranitar and Choice Band Tyranitar are very nice, because Roost Latios completely walls Volcanion while balance teams with Mega Latias give Volcanion a lot of issues. Pokemon that can help make up for Volcanion's subpar matchup against offensive teams are very nice, including Choice Scarf Tapu Lele or Kartana, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Alakazam.</p> "

It also has some nice utility in Stun Spore and is less passive than other suicide leads thanks to a passable Special Attack stat, a strong STAB move in Moonblast, and the ability to boost in Quiver Dance.

Moonblast is Ribombee's most powerful and accurate Fairy-type STAB move, hitting Greninja, Mega Medicham, and Mega Lopunny. Hidden Power Fire deals heavy damage to Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Kartana, and Mega Scizor, particularly the latter two, which are often major issues for the offensive teams Ribombee finds itself on. Stun Spore is used to cripple Pokemon that Ribombee would otherwise not pose a major threat to, such as Heatran and Tornadus-T, and against setup sweepers that could cause you problems. Quiver Dance can instead be used, allowing Ribombee to become much more threatening and therefore successfully set up Sticky Web against Defog users such as Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Mew.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment in tandem with a Timid nature allows Ribombee to outspeed a number of notable Pokemon, such as Greninja and Tornadus-T. Maximum Special Attack investment gives Ribombee as much offensive presence as possible. Focus Sash is used to guarantee that Ribombee is able to set up Sticky Web. Shield Dust is Ribombee's best ability, as it allows it to ignore potential annoying secondary effects from moves such as freezes from Ice Beam, burns from Flamethrower, and flinches from Fake Out.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Ribombee is fairly straightforward to use; in most situations, you should send out Ribombee turn one and set up Sticky Web. When facing setup sweepers or Speed-boosting sweepers such as Shift Gear Magearna, Gyarados, and Blacephalon, you should prioritize using Stun Spore to ensure Ribombee can outspeed and KO them so they do not sweep your team. If opting to use Quiver Dance, it is best to use it in situations where the foe cannot deal much damage to Ribombee, such as against defensive Landorus-T and non-Gyro Ball Ferrothorn, or to threaten Defoggers such as Zapdos and Mew. In some cases, it is a good idea to keep Ribombee alive, even if it's at 1 HP, as its Speed can be very useful in revenge killing Pokemon like Greninja and non-Choice Scarf Kartana.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Ribombee is only used on very offensive teams that appreciate the speed control that Sticky Web provides. Thus, Pokemon like Focus Sash Excadrill and Greninja are good partners, as they can form deadly entry hazard stacking cores on these kinds of teams. Strong wallbreakers with middling Speed stats such as Mega Medicham, Mega Pinsir, and Mega Charizard X are great partners, as they appreciate the speed control from Sticky Web. Similarly, setup sweepers such as Magearna, Gyarados, Blacephalon, and Manaphy are solid teammates, since they too benefit from Sticky Web by making it harder to revenge kill them. Because Sticky Web is absolutely paramount to the success of the teams that utilize it, Defog deterrents such as Serperior and Bisharp are very useful.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Toxapex is one of the best defensive Pokemon in the OU metagame thanks to a combination of excellent natural bulk, multiple methods of recovery, and a key move in Haze, making it a great fit on stall and balance teams alike. Toxapex is one of the few viable Pokemon in OU with access to Toxic Spikes, which gives it a method to passively wear down the opposition, and immensely pressures sweepers from setting up. Its Poison / Water typing furthers its defensive capabilities, letting it check a myriad of offensive threats such as Ash-Greninja, Magearna, Mega Scizor, Volcarona, and Mega Lopunny. Toxapex is able to effectively pivot into many attacks because of its insane bulk and Regenerator ability, allowing it to scout movesets with very little risk. However, abysmal offensive stats make Toxapex somewhat passive, and it relies on status to make up for this shortcoming. Despite its passive nature, Toxapex can be extremely difficult to take down without a dedicated answer to it, and is capable of stalling out many Pokemon that fail to break it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Shed Shell can be used to escape from Heatran's Magma Storms, otherwise Toxapex risks being taken out by the combination of Magma Storm, Earth Power, and Taunt. Block can be used to trap and slowly drain Toxapex's foes with Toxic or Toxic Spikes. Using Spite can speed up the process, as it wears away the foe's PP while it helplessly tries to fight back. Toxapex can use an Eject Button to pivot into an attack and immediately switch out to an ideal teammate. However, finding an ideal moment to make Eject Button activate can prevent Toxapex from pivoting around easily before it activates.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Pokemon such as Tapu Lele, Latios, Mega Gallade, and Mega Alakazam all are capable of doing major damage to Toxapex, though none of them appreciate being worn down by poison or burn. It's worth noting that if Alakazam stays in its base form, it will not be affected by residual damage. Reuniclus gets a special mention thanks to Magic Guard preventing it from getting worn down and it being able to threaten Toxapex with Psyshock.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types such as Tapu Koko, Zapdos, and Mega Manectric all threaten Toxapex with their STAB moves, with Zapdos being particularly effective against Toxic Spikes variants due to its access to Defog. Zapdos is also impossible for Toxapex to significantly cripple unless it's running Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor all are capable of heavily damaging Toxapex, though none are safe switch-ins by any means, with the first being weak to Scald and Garchomp being vulnerable to burns.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt is a good way of shutting down Toxapex, as it can only use Scald to fish for burns. Taunt Tapu Fini is particularly bothersome because it clears Toxic Spikes with Defog, is immune to status until Misty Terrain wears off, and heavily chips away at Toxapex with Nature's Madness. Whirlpool variants, in particular, trap and outright eliminate it. Other Taunt users such as Gengar, Tapu Bulu, and Gyarados are also effective means of shutting Toxapex down and taking advantage of its passivity.</p> ",

Toxic can be run to immediately cripple Pokemon such as Gastrodon, Rotom-W, Zapdos, Mega Charizard X, and Mega Latias. Toxic Spikes works well on Toxapex, as its bulk and typing give it plenty of opportunities to set it up, and it helps a significant amount with wearing down various grounded Pokemon. Baneful Bunker is great for scouting out Choice-locked moves such as from Landorus-T, Greninja, and Tapu Lele while also giving Toxapex a free turn to recover. Baneful Bunker can punish Pokemon that make contact such as Mega Medicham and Mega Lopunny by poisoning as well as Pokemon that would otherwise U-turn out of Toxapex such as Landorus-T expecting a switch or Choice Scarf Victini. Knock Off can be used to cripple Pokemon such as Ferrothorn by removing its Leftovers, as well as Pokemon like Leftovers Heatran and Reuniclus that may try to pivot into Toxapex.</p> <p>In some team situations dropping Haze can be done to let Toxapex use its other move options. Be advised that this makes Toxapex more vulnerable to setup sweepers such as Mega Scizor, Dragon Dance + Clangorous Soulblaze Kommo-o, and Calm Mind and / or Shift Gear Magearna.

Regenerator further increases longevity, making Toxapex difficult to wear down. Black Sludge provides passive recovery and is used over Leftovers to potentially cripple Trick users, if the aforementioned threats are already covered by something else. Payapa Berry can be used to effectively wall Psychium Z Volcarona. Payapa Berry should be used with an alternative spread of 252 HP / 92 Def / 164 SpD, this spread can live Mega Medicham's High Jump Kick into Zen Headbutt.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Toxapex is fairly straightforward to use—switch it in on Pokemon that it walls, and respond by getting off potential burns with Scald or using it as an opportunity to set up a layer of Toxic Spikes. Always try to keep Toxapex at a good amount of health by using Recover or pivoting around with Regenerator, as it needs to be as healthy as possible in order to effectively check the Pokemon it's supposed to. When pinned up against setup sweepers, the best way to handle them is to use Haze followed by using Recover, should Toxapex get low on HP, and whittling the foe with either Scald or Toxic. Use Baneful Bunker to scout out incoming moves, stall out weather turns, or for passive recovery.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Due to Toxapex's very passive nature, which causes it to be vulnerable to a specific set of Pokemon, Toxapex fits best on stall and balance teams, with both providing a way to make up for its shortcomings. Mega Sableye is an excellent partner on stall, as Toxapex covers several Pokemon that it is weak to such as Volcarona, Clefable, Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, non-Thunderbolt Magearna, and non-Thunder Punch Mega Mawile. Chansey covers Toxapex's vulnerability to common Electric- and Psychic-types. On balance, Tangrowth makes for a good partner thanks to its typing, letting it cover Garchomp, Tapu Koko, and non-Supersonic Skystrike Landorus-T all in one teamslot while appreciating Toxapex's ability to absorb Toxic Spikes and cripple Pokemon with status. Celesteela hard checks Tapu Lele and counters all other Psychic-types while also checking the likes of Landorus-T and Garchomp, thus walling most Pokemon that Toxapex is vulnerable to.</p> <p>When dropping Haze, make sure to have Pokemon that can respond to some setup sweepers, as it makes Toxapex more prone to them. Teams that have Pokemon such as Chansey to handle Volcarona and Magearna should suffice here. Other Magearna checks include Gastrodon and Assault Vest Magearna. Mega Scizor should be stopped through Heatran, Magnezone, or either Mega Charizard. Kommo-o is a bit trickier to stop, though there are a few options. If Kommo-o lacks Poison Jab, it is easier to stop with Tapu Fini and Clefable. Heart Swap Magearna can take Kommo-o's boosts and take advantage of them to fire off a stronger STAB Fleur Cannon or Flash Cannon, though it has to be careful of boosted STAB Close Combat and repeated Earthquakes. Remember that these partners can switch into a suspected Clangorous Soulblaze and deny Kommo-o from obtaining its stat boosts. Finally, Ditto is a good teammate, since it can also take advantage of many of the setup sweepers and outspeed them thanks to Choice Scarf.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Araquanid is a suicide lead for Sticky Web teams. Its typing and bulk allow it to take attacks such as the combination of Fake Out + Return from Mega Lopunny and Water Shuriken from Ash-Greninja. However, it is extremely slow and vulnerable to hazard control techniques, including Taunt and Defog.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Band Araquanid is usable on Trick Room teams; this set would generally run Liquidation / Leech Life / Toxic / Hidden Power Fire with a Brave nature. However, it is generally outclassed by Crawdaunt, as Crawdaunt boasts Swords Dance, Aqua Jet, and the ability to break through common defensive threats such as Toxapex. Araquanid is rather one-dimensional in its role as a Sticky Web user, so unless a team features Trick Room setters such as Cresselia and Uxie, it's safe to assume Araquanid is being used to set Sticky Web.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Taunt Users: Pokemon such as Taunt Tapu Koko and Taunt Tapu Lele are able to prevent Araquanid from setting Sticky Web. While they will usually be hit by a follow-up Liquidation, Araquanid cannot afford to predict a use of Taunt, as Taunt is not always used on either of these Pokemon, and Araquanid will fail to set Sticky Web if they simply attack Araquanid and 2HKO it. The rare Tapu Fini also can Taunt Araquanid and successfully use Defog against it.</p> <p><strong>Mega Scizor: Defog Mega Scizor not only walls Araquanid but also can use Defog to remove Sticky Web. Swords Dance Mega Scizor also sets up on Araquanid and will usually win, as hyper offense has very few checks to Swords Dance Mega Scizor. Araquanid will struggle to muscle past Mega Scizor regardless of the set.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Sticky Web provides speed control to support the team. Liquidation is boosted by Araquanid's signature ability Water Bubble, and it OHKOes Pokemon that can prevent Araquanid from using Sticky Web such as Magic Bounce Mega Diancie, paving the way for a sweep from a teammate such as Mega Pinsir or Bisharp. Magic Coat allows Araquanid to bounce back hazards such as Stealth Rock and Spikes from the likes of Landorus-T and Ferrothorn, and it makes Taunt users wary about Taunting Araquanid. Hidden Power Fire OHKOes Kartana, which can normally use Defog to remove Sticky Web. On the other hand, Toxic allows Araquanid to cripple Defog users such as Mantine, Zapdos, and Mew. Mirror Coat is a niche choice that allows Araquanid to use its good special bulk to bounce a special attack back, such as Volt Switch from Tapu Koko, potentially OHKOing a threat. Leech Life is a final option that gives Araquanid a secondary STAB move to hit the likes of Ash-Greninja, but it is not recommended, as it is weak and does not qualify for a Water Bubble boost.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack allows Araquanid to hit as hard as possible with Water Bubble-boosted Liquidation. The Special Attack investment lets Araquanid always OHKO Kartana with Hidden Power Fire. The rest of the EVs are placed in HP to give Araquanid extra bulk to check Pokemon such as Heatran and Greninja, as well as always survive Fake Out + Return from Mega Lopunny. A Brave nature is used to boost the power of Liquidation without compromising Araquanid's bulk or ability to OHKO Kartana. Water Bubble is the best possible ability on Araquanid, as not only does it double the power of Araquanid's Water-type moves, but it also gives Araquanid a resistance to Fire-type moves and immunity to burns from the likes of Mega Sableye and Mew.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Araquanid should nearly always be your lead, unless it is paired with a second suicide lead such as Focus Sash Landorus-T or Excadrill. If it's possible to preserve Araquanid after setting Sticky Web and the opposing team has a Greninja or a Heatran, keeping Araquanid can be convenient to switch into the likes of Water Shuriken and Magma Storm.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Pinsir and Bisharp are standard Pokemon on Sticky Web teams that also appreciate Araquanid's ability to either KO or severely damage common checks such as Mega Diancie and Tapu Koko. Araquanid is best paired with another suicide lead to form a double Focus Sash core. Landorus-T and Excadrill are excellent partners in this regard, setting Stealth Rock relatively reliably. Araquanid fits best on hyper offense, so strong breakers that appreciate Sticky Web support such as Tapu Lele and Kartana are generally ideal.</p> "

  "Pyukumuku": {
    "overview": "<p>Due to Pyukumuku's combination of good defensive stats, a pure Water typing, access to reliable recovery, and an amazing ability in Unaware, it's able to carve itself a decent niche by being an Unaware user with better overall bulk than both Quagsire and Clefable, allowing it to handle certain setup sweepers and offensive threats such as Mega Pinsir, Mega Swampert, and Manaphy better than the other two, while having useful and unique utility options in Block, Spite, and Soak that make the target unable to switch out, lower the target's PP, or allow it to poison Steel- and Poison-types. Aside from being an Unaware wall, Pyukumuku's other role is that of a bulky trapper that is able to either PP or Toxic stall passive targets such as Clefable, Gliscor, and Celesteela. This is incredibly useful for stall teams that want to remove a specific nuisance early on. However, Pyukumuku is a massive momentum drain, so much so that it basically requires that you use it exclusively on stall teams where its teammates can make up for its shortcomings. It also has a barren movepool, leaving it both one-dimensional and predictable. Due to not having any attacking options and only being able to inflict damage with Toxic, Pyukumuku is extremely passive and will lose to any Taunt users while being severely annoyed by Substitute users. Finally, even though it has a lot of unique features going for it, Pyukumuku can still fall behind the other Unaware users; Quagsire having actual attacking options prevents it from being complete Taunt bait, and it also checks Choice Band Tyranitar and provides a useful Electric immunity, while Clefable can support teammates with the use of Heal Bell and Wish.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Innards Out, while less reliable than Unaware, can be used to force damage onto strong wallbreakers and thus remove them from the match. The moveset should be Toxic / Soak / Rest / Block with maximum HP investment, a Hasty nature, 0 IVs in Attack, Defense, and Special Defense, and an Aguav Berry, and it should be set to Level 96. This set maximizes Pyukumuku's HP while lowering its bulk as much as possible. Pyukumuku will end up with 301 HP, the same amount as Hoopa-U, which lets Innards Out OHKO it, and it also prevents Pyukumuku from getting 3HKOed by Seismic Toss. If the foe isn't able to OHKO Pyukumuku but takes over 75% of its health, the Aguav Berry heals 50% of its HP and puts it in range of the next attack, maximizing the effects of Innards Out. Gastro Acid over Block can be used to remove Poison Heal from Swords Dance Gliscor and Magic Guard from both Clefable and Reuniclus, but it's usually not worth losing an important move in Block, and Spite sets can still beat the aforementioned targets. Counter over Block is another possible option, allowing Pyukumuku to remove frighteningly strong physical wallbreakers such as Kartana, Mega Mawile, and Choice Band Hoopa-U in exchange for Pyukumuku's HP while not having to utilize Innards Out, but losing Block puts a damper on its PP and Toxic stalling capabilities.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Taunt Users: Taunt users such as Heatran and Protean Greninja are able to completely shut down Pyukumuku and stop it from utilizing any of its moves.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Users: Substitute users such as Serperior are able to bypass Pyukumuku's only form of damage and become unaffected by Block. Mega Gyarados can also use Substitute and also ignores Unaware thanks to Mold Breaker.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types such as Tapu Koko and Zapdos are able to switch into Pyukumuku and force it out, and both boast reliable recovery in Roost, allowing them to mitigate Toxic damage.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Offensive Grass-types such as Kartana and Tapu Bulu are able to overpower Pyukumuku using their super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers: Wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele, Kyurem-B, Hoopa-U, and Mega Heracross are able to overpower Pyukumuku and easily 2HKO it.</p> ",

        "name": "Unaware Wall",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Block is used to prevent the target from switching out, which can allow Pyukumuku to PP stall foes with Spite more effectively or force more Toxic damage to quickly rack up. Recover gives Pyukumuku reliable recovery and allows it to continuously check threats throughout the match. Spite, in tandem with Block, allows Pyukumuku to deplete the PP of Poison Heal and Magic Guard users and beat Manaphy. This especially helps against Calm Mind Clefable, which is otherwise a very annoying threat to any stall team that lacks Haze Toxapex. Rest is used to relieve Pyukumuku of status and beat other defensive walls such as Chansey and Toxapex, but, more importantly, it allows Pyukumuku to effectively outstall Mega Sableye if Block gets bounced back and traps Pyukumuku. Taunt may also be used instead of Rest to accelerate the PP stalling. Alternatively, Toxic and Soak are also viable options instead of Spite and Taunt. Toxic is Pyukumuku's main and only real form of damage and, in conjunction with Soak, allows it to poison the majority of the tier, barring certain Magic Guard, Magic Bounce, and Poison Heal users. Soak allows Steel- and Poison-types to get hit by Toxic and can also remove the target's access to its STAB-boosted moves. One of the main advantages of using Toxic + Soak is being able to cripple common switch-ins such as Tapu Koko and Tapu Bulu, making it more effective against offensive teams.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>A Bold nature with maximum HP and Defense investment allows Pyukumuku to more easily handle the large number of physical attackers in the tier. Unaware allows Pyukumuku to check setup sweepers by ignoring their boosts. Leftovers allows Pyukumuku to avoid important 2HKOs from strong offensive threats and gives it a small amount of passive recovery.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>It's best to preserve Pyukumuku's HP and keep it healthy enough to check setup sweepers such as Hawlucha and Manaphy and some wallbreakers such as Mega Swampert. Use Recover liberally to keep Pyukumuku healthy and scout possible Z-Moves from wallbreakers such as Landorus-T, which might put it in range of regular attacks. Keep Pyukumuku away from common Taunt users such as Heatran to prevent it from getting crippled. Use Block when you suspect the opponent to stay in with a trappable target, such as against Clefable if Pyukumuku is running Spite. If using the Soak + Toxic variant, try not to reveal Soak- against Steel and Poison-types such as Celesteela and Toxapex until you have trapped them with Block.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pyukumuku only fits on stall teams, so staples of the archetype are the best teammates. Mega Sableye is a good example here, as it can bounce back Taunt from Heatran and check non-Z-Move variants. Chansey is able to take on a large variety of powerful special attackers that can overwhelm Pyukumuku such as Choice Specs Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Mega Latios. It can also utilize Heal Bell to cure Pyukumuku of status. Zapdos is able to check an otherwise devastating stallbreaker in Mega Gyarados while also removing entry hazards that may cut into Pyukumuku's longevity. Physically defensive Tangrowth can also deal with Mega Gyarados, and with Hidden Power Fire or Sludge Bomb, it can deal with Kartana or Tapu Bulu, respectively. Hippowdon is able to soft check physical attackers that Pyukumuku cannot, such as Mega Mawile and Choice Band Tyranitar, while also providing a useful Electric immunity. Jirachi, while sometimes harder to fit on stall teams, is able to take on important threats in Tapu Lele and Kyurem-B and pass Wishes to Pyukumuku.</p> "

  "Mimikyu": {
    "overview": "<p>Mimikyu holds a niche in the OU metagame due to its unique typing and ability Disguise, which gives it a free turn to attack or set up. Defensively, Mimikyu can act as a blanket check to many threats such as Volcarona and Mega Medicham. Ghost- and Fairy-type STAB moves allow Mimikyu to hit the entire metagame for at least neutral damage. Decent Attack along with access to Swords Dance and great STAB coverage allows Mimikyu to clean easily. However, Mimikyu struggles to break common defensive Pokemon such Toxapex and Landorus-T. Also, once Disguise is broken, Mimikyu is very easy to revenge kill, as it is very frail and isn't very fast.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mimikyu can use Trick Room effectively, as it can almost always set up Trick Room thanks to Disguise. Will-O-Wisp can be used to cripple switch-ins such as Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor. Red Card can be used in conjunction with Disguise to phaze a foe. Taunt can be used to stallbreak; however, this is done better by Tapu Koko. Destiny Bond can be used to take a foe down with Mimikyu.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Ferrothorn can easily take multiple Shadow Claws and either knock Mimikyu out with Gyro Ball or cripple it with Thunder Wave or Leech Seed. Mega Scizor, Celesteela, Magearna, and Skarmory can all take at least one boosted Shadow Claw and retaliate with their Steel-type STAB moves or, in Skarmory's case, phaze Mimikyu out.</p> <p><strong>Physically Bulky Pokemon: Landorus-T is a great answer to Mimikyu, as it can tank any hit Mimikyu can throw at it and do massive damage with Earthquake. Toxapex can use Haze to remove any Swords Dance boosts and threaten Mimikyu with a Scald burn. Finally, Mega Venusaur is a great counter to Mimikyu if Mimikyu has already used its Z-Move.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Choice Scarf Excadrill is a good check to Mimikyu, as it can KO it through Disguise thanks to Mold Breaker. Other Choice Scarf users such as Tapu Lele can also prey on Mimikyu's low defenses.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Swords Dance allows Mimikyu to boost its below-average Attack stat. Shadow Sneak makes up for Mimikyu's low Speed and is used to revenge kill faster threats. Play Rough is Mimikyu's strongest move, hitting Pokemon such as Garchomp, Tyranitar, and Mega Lopunny for massive damage. Finally, Shadow Claw has nearly perfect neutral coverage with Play Rough and can hit Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Celesteela, Gengar, and Heatran.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Life Orb is the preferred item, as it gives Mimikyu a consistent boost in power, allowing it to hit much harder. Ghostium Z lets Mimikyu fire off a strong Never-Ending Nightmare, which allows it to break through certain threats such as Celesteela. Maximum Speed and Attack investment allows Mimikyu to hit as hard and be as fast as possible. An Adamant nature allows Mimikyu to do much more damage to Pokemon such as offensive Landorus-T and Celesteela, especially after a Swords Dance, and it is the preferred nature on Sticky Web teams. However, a Jolly nature allows Mimikyu to outpace Jolly Landorus-T, Hasty Kyurem-B, and non-Choice Scarf Tapu Lele.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mimikyu's Disguise should be saved until the mid- or late-game, as Disguise can be used to stop a setup sweeper such as non-Mega Gyarados or Volcarona. However, it is acceptable to use up Mimikyu's Disguise early-game to weaken Pokemon such as Landorus-T. Try to use Swords Dance when Mimikyu has a clear shot at sweeping or when you need to break through the opposing Pokemon. If Ghostium Z is run over Life Orb, use Never-Ending Nightmare after a Swords Dance to break Pokemon such as Celesteela. Be careful of Psychic Terrain, as it blocks Shadow Sneak.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mimikyu fits very well on Sticky Web teams, as it can benefit from the foe's Speed decrease and can spinblock. Thus, Sticky Web setters such as Smeargle and Shuckle make good teammates. Other Pokemon found on Sticky Web teams such as Bisharp and Mega Pinsir also make good teammates. Magnezone can trap bulky Steel-types such as Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory. Slow VoltTurn users such as Landorus-T and Assault Vest Magearna can get Mimikyu in without breaking Disguise. Entry hazard setters such as Greninja and Garchomp can wear down Mimikyu's checks, allowing it to sweep. Heatran is also a good partner, as it deals with Ferrothorn and Scizor while also being able to set up Stealth Rock. Finally, wallbreakers such as Mega Charizard Y, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Mawile can make it easier for Mimikyu to clean up late-game.</p> "

Likewise, Belly Drum with Salac Berry is also a deadly sweeper that can be quite the useful addition to hyper offense by cleaning up teams or punching hole for fellow sweepers. Kommo-o's bulk and typing are beneficial to its offensive role too, letting it act as a soft check to many Pokemon that are troublesome to offense, such as Ash-Greninja, Blacephalon, Tyranitar, and Heatran while allowing Kommo-o to set up Stealth Rock or Substitutes on a number of common Pokemon in the tier, such as Ferrothorn, Jirachi, and Tapu Bulu. Its bulk and typing also make it resistant to a number of forms of revenge killing, such as Choice Scarf Kartana and priority like Water Shuriken or Sucker Punch. Alternatively, a specially defensive set can also be run on stall teams, which provides stall a switch-in to notable breakers such as Blacephalon, Heatran, Tyranitar, and Mega Gyarados. However, Kommo-o does have its downsides. Its typing, while good in a lot of regards, leaves it weak to some common typings like Psychic, Ice, and especially Fairy. This weakness to Fairy also extends to the fact that Fairy-types can easily block its Z-Move and prevent it from sweeping, as can Pokemon sacrificed to entry hazard damage. Additionally, its Speed is only decent, meaning offensive sets are prone to being revenge killed by faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Choice Scarf Greninja. As for the specially defensive set, it can struggle defensively due to a lack of access to any reliable recovery, making it over-reliant on Wish support from other members of its team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>An offensive set with Dragon Dance, Close Combat, Poison Jab, and Clanging Scales with Kommonium Z is an alternative to the offensive set listed above. It's actually better in some regards, namely in that it has an easier time setting up thanks to Dragon Dance boosting both Attack and Speed. However, it has less potential for results, as the listed coverage fails to OHKO staples of the tier like Magearna, Mega Mawile, Tornadus-T, and Toxapex. It also requires some heavy prediction to make effective use of the Z-Move due to Fairy-types preventing the boosts. If using specially defensive Kommo-o with other consistent entry hazard setters, you could replace Stealth Rock with a coverage move like Poison Jab to catch Fairy-types such as Tapu Bulu or Toxic to cripple Pokemon like Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Mega Alakazam.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Specially defensive Kommo-o only has Earthquake to hit Fairy-types, meaning it is forced out by the majority of Fairy-types in the tier, such as Tapu Bulu, Tapu Lele, and Clefable. The Belly Drum set has a better matchup, with +6 Thunder Punch OHKOing quite a few common ones, but it still misses out on healthy Clefable and is outsped by Choice Scarf Tapu Lele.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Mega Alakazam, Tapu Lele, and Mega Medicham don't really fear much from defensive Kommo-o and easily OHKO it in return. Additionally, bulkier Psychic-types like Reuniclus, Mew, and Mega Slowbro can at least take one hit from +6 Kommo-o and threaten it back, with Reuniclus actually being able to set up on it with Acid Armor if at full HP.</p> <p><strong>Status: Toxic renders the defensive set unable to properly check the Pokemon it should and limits how many turns the offensive set has to break. Burn and paralysis severely cripple the offensive set, either leaving it much weaker to the point where it can't break or prone to being revenge killed.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive Stealth Rock",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Kommo-o's decent bulk and useful typing allow it to set up Stealth Rock against common Pokemon like Ash-Greninja and Heatran. Kommo-o can also pressure Defog users like Tornadus-T and Zapdos once it has set up with Clangorous Soulblaze. Clanging Scales is a powerful STAB move that is required to use Clangorous Soulblaze. It also bypasses Substitute, so Pokemon such as Serperior and Kyurem can't attempt to take advantage of Kommo-o. Close Combat is crucial for hitting Steel-types like Heatran and Magnezone, which resist or are immune to Kommo-o's other moves, Magearna and Celesteela, which would otherwise beat it one-on-one, and Dark-types like Ash-Greninja and Tyranitar that can survive an unboosted Clanging Scales. Poison Jab hits Fairy-types such as Tapu Fini and Clefable for decent damage when boosted, as they'd otherwise wall Kommo-o, and it also OHKOes Tapu Bulu and Tapu Lele at +1. Flamethrower is an option to hit Mega Scizor, which can easily take a +1 Close Combat. It also hits Steel-types like Mega Mawile and Ferrothorn and Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tangrowth while avoiding the Defense and Special Defense drops from Close Combat and Clanging Scales. However, giving up Poison Jab leaves Kommo-o walled by Fairy-types such as Tapu Fini and Clefable.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Kommonium Z turns Clanging Scales into Clangorous Soulblaze, which can be used to help break through troublesome defensive Pokemon such as Gliscor and Reuniclus. It also gives Kommo-o a +1 boost in each stat, making it a potent late-game sweeper as well as a Stealth Rock setter that can pressure Defog users like Tornadus-T and Zapdos. Bulletproof grants Kommo-o an immunity to moves such as Ferrothorn's Gyro Ball, Blacephalon's Shadow Ball, and Tangrowth and Amoonguss's Sludge Bomb, giving it a safer opportunity to set up against these Pokemon. An EV spread of 208 HP / 56 Atk / 244 Spe gives Kommo-o the bulk to survive two Hydro Pumps from Ash-Greninja while maintaining the Speed to outpace Mega Alakazam at +1, although this reduces its damage output. A Hasty nature is used instead of Naive, as it allows Kommo-o to better take Hydro Pump and Dark Pulse from Ash-Greninja and Magma Storm from Heatran.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Kommo-o should attempt to set up Stealth Rock early-game, and Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Heatran give it a good opportunity to do so, as they're unable to do much damage to it. Kommo-o can also switch directly into offensive Pokemon like Ash-Greninja, Heatran, and Tyranitar thanks to its typing and decent bulk. However, this wears it down quickly, so if Kommo-o's goal is to sweep late-game, this is not always the best option. Kommo-o also has to be cautious of coverage moves like Heatran's Corkscrew Crash and Mega Tyranitar's Ice Punch. Once Stealth Rock is up, Kommo-o can attempt to weaken its checks such as Magearna and Tapu Fini with Close Combat and Poison Jab, respectively; this can help its teammates and give it potential to clean late-game. Kommo-o must be wary of the Defense and Special Defense drops from Clanging Scales and Close Combat, as they leave it more vulnerable to Pokemon it would usually check. Clangorous Soulblaze is best used against Pokemon that Kommo-o forces out, ensuring that it sets up safely without being put in range of attacks from faster Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T using Earthquake and Kartana using Sacred Sword. Avoid using Clangorous Soulblaze if the opponent still has a Fairy-type that can switch in or a Pokemon that can be sacrificed to entry hazards, as this will waste Kommo-o's Z-Crystal and prevent its boosts. Status conditions will often leave Kommo-o unable to sweep due to it being worn down quickly or having a lowered Speed or Attack stat, so be cautious against Pokemon like Toxapex, Gliscor, and Rotom-W that could potentially inflict them. If Kommo-o's goal is to keep hazards up, then the Z-Move can be used against Tornadus-T and Zapdos as they attempt to remove them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Kommo-o fits best on offensively oriented teams with Pokemon like Serperior and Ash-Greninja that make it easier for Kommo-o to sweep late-game by weakening its checks. Since Kommo-o needs the opposing team to be weakened before attempting a sweep, strong wallbreakers like Mega Mawile, Kartana, and Ash-Greninja are useful partners; they also appreciate Kommo-o setting up Stealth Rock. Another way to weaken the opposing team is with Spikes. Ash-Greninja forms a good hazard-stacking core with Kommo-o while wearing down Tapu Fini and Magearna. Protean Greninja also sets up Spikes and can lure and KO Fairy-types such as Tapu Fini and Clefable with Gunk Shot. Ferrothorn is also able to set up Spikes while switching into some of the offensive Psychic- and Fairy-types that Kommo-o dislikes. Kommo-o struggles against offensive Psychic- and Fairy-types like Mega Alakazam, Tapu Lele, and Mega Mawile, especially when unboosted. Steel-types such as Magearna and Celesteela can take on Psychic-types, and the former can also switch into Tornadus-T; both of them appreciate Kommo-o's ability to switch into Fire-types. Heatran can switch into Mega Mawile and take a hit from Tapu Lele as long as it's cautious of Focus Blast; it appreciates that Kommo-o can switch into Ash-Greninja if needed. Kommo-o can act as a check to Ash-Greninja and Heatran, although it gets worn down quickly, so an additional check to these Pokemon is needed. Toxapex, Tapu Bulu, and Assault Vest Tangrowth can check Ash-Greninja, while Pokemon like Gliscor and Mega Alakazam can switch into Heatran if needed. Kommo-o is unable to take down Toxapex, which can also remove its boosts with Haze. Therefore, Pokemon that can deal with Toxapex such as Mega Alakazam and Tapu Lele are useful partners.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Kommo-o is an effective Stealth Rock setter, as its defensive niche allows it to force some switches and it can pressure a lot of entry hazard removers such as Tornadus-T and Excadrill with Toxic or Drain Punch. Toxic alongside Protect is fantastic for racking up chip damage on the likes of Landorus-T, Mega Alakazam, and Tornadus-T that would otherwise get a free switch in on Kommo-o. Protect is multifaceted; aside from the above application, it also gives Kommo-o an extra turn of Leftovers recovery and allows it to block Z-Moves and scout Choice-locked Pokemon. Drain Punch provides Kommo-o with some extra recovery and pressures Pokemon like Ash-Greninja and Heatran.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>140 Speed EVs are ran in order to outspeed the likes of Timid Magnezone and Adamant Tyranitar. Bulletproof is Kommo-o's most useful ability, immunizing it against a number of moves, with the most notable examples being Gyro Ball from Ferrothorn, Sludge Bomb from Tangrowth, Mega Venusaur, and Amoonguss, and Shadow Ball from Blacephalon.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use this Kommo-o set to switch into Pokemon like Ash-Greninja, Heatran, Rotom-W, and Magnezone, and use the free turn to set up Stealth Rock. Due to Kommo-o's lack of reliable recovery, it can be worn down throughout the game. Try to avoid scenarios that will exacerbate this issue, such as Kommo-o's Leftovers being removed by Knock Off and switching it into entry hazards, especially Spikes and Toxic Spikes, repeatedly. If the opponent has a Pokemon that totally shuts down Kommo-o, such as Gliscor or Tapu Fini, try not to let them in freely; you can double switch into a Pokemon that can take advantage of them. However, this isn't always needed—by getting up Stealth Rock, Tapu Fini and Defog Gliscor will often be forced to remove them, giving you a free switch into a Pokemon that can take advantage of them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Specially defensive Kommo-o fits best on bulky offense, as compressing a Stealth Rock setter, a Heatran check, and an Ash-Greninja check in into one teamslot is very beneficial for the archetype. Steel-types like Magearna, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor are good teammates, as they can check Psychic-types like Mega Alakazam, Mega Latias, and Tapu Lele and Fairy-types like Magearna and Clefable for Kommo-o. In return, Kommo-o can consistently switch into Heatran, arguably the biggest threat to Steel-types in the tier. Tyranitar also works well as an answer to both Flying-types like Tornadus-T and the aforementioned Psychic-types. Additionally, it has the extra benefit of being able to Pursuit trap and potentially remove these Pokemon. Rotom-W and Tangrowth are great teammates for Kommo-o, as they can take advantage of counters to it, particularly Gliscor and Tapu Fini.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Drain Punch is used over moves like Close Combat, as the extra power isn't needed, and the recovery is greatly appreciated, leaving Kommo-o less prone to being revenge killed. The HP reduction from Substitute and Belly Drum activates Kommo-o's Salac Berry, giving it a boost to its Speed. Substitute is also key in letting Kommo-o set up on common Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Rotom-W, and Zapdos. Thunder Punch provides good coverage alongside Drain Punch, OHKOing Fighting-resistant Pokemon like Tornadus-T, Toxapex, and Tapu Fini after a Belly Drum while still providing neutral coverage against most other Fighting-type checks, namely Tapu Lele, Reuniclus, and Clefable.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>52 HP EVs ensure that Choice Scarf Magnezone can't break Kommo-o's Substitute behind screens. It also allows Kommo-o to set up a Belly Drum on Magnezone while avoiding being 2HKOed by Flash Cannon. Finally, it leaves Kommo-o's HP divisible by 4, meaning Salac Berry will always be activated after Substitute and Belly Drum. Bulletproof grants Kommo-o an immunity to a large number of moves, allowing it to set up on attacks like Ferrothorn's Gyro Ball, Blacephalon's Shadow Ball, and Mega Venusaur's Sludge Bomb.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This set is used on hyper offensive teams, so the majority of the time Kommo-o should be sent out to attempt to sweep when its checks have been weakened and revenge killers dealt with. It can also be used to weaken the opposing team in order to pave the way for one of its teammates to clean up. Kommo-o's typing and decent bulk mean it can be used to check certain threats like Heatran and Ash-Greninja. However, sometimes it can be better to not use it to check these Pokemon, as it can put Kommo-o in range of even resisted priority like Water Shuriken and Sucker Punch after a Belly Drum, or it can simply leave Kommo-o unable to set up a Belly Drum and render it mostly useless offensively. While Kommo-o can set up on numerous Pokemon, it is often not a good idea to switch into these Pokemon and try to set up, as they will often be able to harass Kommo-o if it doesn't have a Substitute up—for example, Ferrothorn can whittle it down with Leech Seed, and Rotom-W can burn it with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set's used on hyper offense teams due to its reliance on one-time setup, so it should be paired with teammates that would fit on this archetype. Even with +1 Speed, Kommo-o is outsped by Choice Scarf users like Greninja and Tapu Lele, meaning it can be revenge killed if Substitute is broken. Sticky Web helps to circumvent this, so setters like Ribombee and Araquanid can be used. Dual screens Tapu Koko is an exemplary partner, as it sets up both screens that give Kommo-o more setup opportunities, has U-turn to pivot Kommo-o in, and boosts the power of Thunder Punch, allowing Kommo-o to OHKO Pokemon like Clefable and Mew with minor chip damage. Hawlucha has great synergy with Kommo-o, as they pressure each other's checks, namely Clefable, Reuniclus, and Hippowdon, likely facilitating a sweep. Additionally, Hawlucha too appreciates Tapu Koko as a teammate, completing a good offensive core with it. Unaware walls such as Clefable, Pyukumuku, and Quagsire perpetually wall Kommo-o, so it should be paired with sweepers like Mega Gyarados and Manaphy that can overcome these walls.</p> "

A good matchup against prominent Defog users like Tornadus-T and Tapu Fini also helps Nihilego keep Toxic Spikes up. Additionally, Nihilego's high Special Defense and typing let it act as a decent check to threats like Tornadus-T and Mega Charizard Y. Nihilego's typing has some major drawbacks, however, as every Ground-type in the tier easily beats Nihilego, and its STAB combination is walled by most Steel-types; this cuts Nihilego's effectiveness a lot given that both Ground- and Steel-types see use on almost every team. Nihilego also faces competition as a Toxic Spikes setter from Toxapex, which provides a ton of defensive utility to the team, and from Greninja, which is far more versatile and unpredictable than Nihilego and potentially can lure in and KO Toxapex too.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hidden Power Ice prevents Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T from coming in on Nihilego for free. However, Nihilego struggles to fit this move onto its set.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Garchomp, Gliscor, Gastrodon, and other Ground-types can come in on Nihilego and beat it one-on-one. Most of them dislike being poisoned, however. Landorus-T, while it can't really switch in on Nihilego, is able to revenge kill it with Earthquake. Gliscor is an especially notable counter to Nihilego because it is immune to poison and has a form of reliable recovery in Roost.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Pokemon like Magearna, Heatran, and Jirachi don't care about Nihilego's STAB moves, and their defensive sets take relatively small damage from Thunder and Gigavolt Havoc. Celesteela also sponges Nihilego's STAB combination relatively well, but it hates eating Gigavolt Havoc. Ferrothorn deserves a special mention because it resists or is immune to all of Nihilego's attacks and can set up entry hazards on it.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attacks: Nihilego's nonexistent physical bulk means that any physical attack will put a heavy dent in it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: While Nihilego's Speed tier isn't bad, there are still plenty of faster threats like Ash-Greninja, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Kartana, and Mega Alakazam, all of which beat Nihilego.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: This Pokemon absolutely counters Nihilego thanks to its sky-high special bulk and cannot be outstalled by poison thanks to Natural Cure, reliable recovery in Soft-Boiled, and potentially Heal Bell.</p> ",

Thunder is used over Thunderbolt in order to fire off a stronger Z-Move; Gigavolt Havoc from Thunder allows Nihilego to OHKO Toxapex and Celesteela after Stealth Rock and one Power Gem as well as inflict more damage on Steel-types like Magearna, Mega Mawile, and Celesteela.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Electrium Z is necessary to turn Thunder into Gigavolt Havoc, which prevents Nihilego from being a deadweight against Steel-types and lets it beat Toxapex.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Nihilego's main aim is to set up Toxic Spikes and keep them up during the battle by aggressively playing around your opponent's entry hazard removers and positioning your team so they won't have free turns to remove Toxic Spikes. The best method to bring Nihilego in on the field is through aggressive plays and double switches to keep momentum up and pressure attempts to remove Toxic Spikes. Use Gigavolt Havoc wisely, since Nihilego absolutely requires it to break past certain threats; also, be sure to chip down your intended Z-Move target before firing Gigavolt Havoc off. The chip damage is necessary because most Gigavolt Havoc targets, like Toxapex and Celesteela, are capable of surviving it from full HP. Be wary of Baneful Bunker and Protect from these two, however. Be especially careful with Gigavolt Havoc if any of your opponent's Ground-types are still active; if the move hits one of them, you will completely waste your team's Z-Move and all your momentum.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Toxic Spikes is a pretty niche move, so Nihilego fits only on teams containing Pokemon that can make use of it, like Mega Latias, Reuniclus, and Suicune. The former two also appreciate Nihilego being able to weaken Steel-types with a well-timed Gigavolt Havoc. Since Nihilego loses to any Ground-type in the tier, sturdy answers to them like Tangrowth, Mega Latias, and Tapu Bulu are necessary teammates. Pokemon that can take advantage of Steel-types make for great allies to Nihilego; for example, Suicune and Reuniclus can capitalize on passive Steel-types like Celesteela and Ferrothorn, while Heatran can also handle more offensive ones, like Magearna and Jirachi. Additionally, Heatran's Magma Storm synergizes very well with Nihilego's Toxic Spikes. Bulky Steel- and Grass-types such as Celesteela, Mega Scizor, Tangrowth, and Ferrothorn can switch into Pokemon that force Nihilego out, like Mega Alakazam and Ash-Greninja.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Buzzwole's great physical bulk in conjunction with its rare defensive typing allows it to function as a blanket check on stall teams to many of the metagame's most dangerous physical attackers such as Kartana, Garchomp, and Tapu Bulu. Having a Bulk Up-boosted Buzzwole can be a win condition for stall teams, potentially sweeping bulky offensive teams in the late-game after they've been whittled down by Buzzwole's team. Buzzwole's movepool gives it access to a wide variety of coverage options such as Ice Punch for Gliscor and Landorus-T, allowing it to effectively utilize its high Attack stat. On the other hand, Buzzwole's mediocre special bulk leaves it susceptible to being KOed by strong special attacks such as Tapu Koko's Thunderbolt and Greninja's Hydro Pump after prior damage. Buzzwole's defensive typing also leaves it easily preyed upon by common attacking types in Flying, Fairy, and Psychic, and Buzzwole is easy to KO due to its poor Speed tier, so Pokemon like Mega Pinsir, Tapu Lele, and Clefable all force Buzzwole out with ease.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Buzzwole can also run offensive sets that attempt to utilize its impressive offensive coverage, but these sets are oftentimes hard to justify over other breakers like Mega Heracross and Hoopa-U that can break through bulkier teams with much more ease.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-type Pokemon in general, particularly Clefable, are problematic for Buzzwole because they can easily take any move that it can throw at them and threaten it out with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Similarly to Fairy-types, Psychic-types are very problematic for Buzzwole.

Bulk Up allows Buzzwole to set up alongside setup sweepers such as Kartana in order to more reliably check them, and it makes Buzzwole an endgame sweeper capable of taking down weakened teams.

Avoid letting Buzzwole absorb status such as burn or poison, as status conditions limit its ability to effectively beat the aforementioned threats. Keep entry hazards off your side of the field so that Buzzwole can reliably beat Pokemon such as Corkscrew Crash Kartana. Additionally, analyze the opposing team and scout for lures such as Supersonic Skystrike Landorus-T if Buzzwole is meant to check multiple Pokemon so it can avoid being KOed in the early-game. When utilizing Buzzwole as part of the team's win condition, wait for the opposing team to be worn down before setting up and attempting to win the battle.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Buzzwole tends to fit better onto bulkier teams, usually stall or semi-stall, that need a consistent answer to Garchomp and Kartana.

It struggles to make progress against defensive builds featuring Regenerator walls like Toxapex and Tangrowth, and Gliscor, whose Poison Heal lets it break even with Leech Seed's draining.

Specially based Autotomize sets are also viable with Flyinium Z, but its inability to break Toxapex, Heatran, and Zapdos is very unfavorable. Earthquake can be used on Celesteela instead of Flamethrower, as an option to hit Heatran and deal more damage to Magnezone, but losing out on Kartana, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and opposing Celesteela is a huge deal.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Zapdos: Zapdos is one of few Pokemon that can wall Celesteela completely, as it takes negligible damage from all of Celesteela's common offensive options and can PP stall Leech Seed very easily.

Kartana's offensive prowess usually gives it at least one opportunity to set up on a foe that it threatens out during a match; thus, try to set up a Swords Dance against Pokemon that it can beat, such as Rotom-W, Ferrothorn, and Gliscor. Bulkier teams tend to have Pokemon faster than Kartana, such as Mega Latias and Mega Alakazam, that can easily revenge kill it. If your ultimate goal is to sweep, make it your primary task to eliminate these faster Pokemon before setting up; with these threats gone, Kartana can easily punch holes in these teams and pave the way for other teammates to sweep. Offensive teams tend to struggle switching into Kartana with the exception of glue Pokemon like Tornadus-T, but they can easily revenge kill it with faster Pokemon like Mega Alakazam, Greninja, and Tapu Koko, so try to weaken the opposing team as much as possible to allow a teammate to sweep easier late-game. It is important to note that even without a Swords Dance Attack boost, Kartana can OHKO Tornadus-T if it tries to pivot into Kartana to scout for a Choice set. Use this to your advantage, as removing Tornadus-T from opposing teams can open up a big hole for Kartana to do some serious damage.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pursuit from Tyranitar is extremely useful for Kartana because it eliminates this set's biggest revenge killers on bulky offense and balance builds: Mega Latias, Mega Latios, Mega Alakazam, and Tornadus-T. Offensive Pokemon that can simultaneously pressure Kartana's checks like Tangrowth and Zapdos, such as Ash-Greninja, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Alakazam, make for good partners. These Pokemon also have an easier time sweeping late-game after Kartana has weakened the opposing team. Pokemon like Heatran, Volcarona, and Magnezone can not only handle Celesteela and Mega Scizor, two of Kartana's best counters, but also draw in Pokemon that Kartana can potentially set up on such as Rotom-W, Toxapex, and Gliscor. Kartana is very frail and outsped by faster offensive Pokemon like Ash-Greninja, Mega Alakazam, and Tornadus-T, so having a Pokemon in the back to check these Pokemon is key; some good examples include Assault Vest Magearna and Tapu Koko. Volt Switch and U-turn users such as Rotom-W, Landorus-T, and Assault Vest Magearna can bring Kartana into play safely without it having to risk taking big hits due to its poor bulk.</p> "

        "name": "Paper Plane (Choice Scarf)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Leaf Blade is the Grass-type STAB move that hits quite hard for a move on a Choice Scarf user thanks to Kartana's high Attack stat, and Sacred Sword is the best complementary coverage move, hitting opposing Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Heatran. Another potential move can be Smart Strike, which is a secondary STAB move that can knock out Fairy-types such as Clefable. Knock Off is a great utility move to cripple Pokemon that wall Choice Scarf Kartana such as Celesteela and Zapdos, ridding them of their Leftovers. On the utility front, Defog can be used in the final slot if you want a quick, convenient form of entry hazard removal to slap onto more offensively oriented teams. Finally, Giga Impact is viable to remove Volcarona, as teams with Choice Scarf Kartana often are more offensive, lack another revenge killer, and struggle to defensively check Volcarona to the necessary extent, giving Kartana an emergency button to remove it at the cost of Kartana giving up a free turn after use to recharge.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread allows Kartana to have a high damage output and Speed stat, as it is meant to be threatening and quick. Jolly is also used in order to maximize Kartana's Speed, as many Pokemon have similar base Speed stats. Choice Scarf is present to let Kartana clean opposing teams and act as a revenge killer, letting it outrun everything that is unboosted and most setup sweepers at +1. In addition, Defog can let it act as an entry hazard remover for a team that is in need of one, essentially letting you have an emergency button in case of a situation that is getting out of hand due to the presence of entry hazards on the field.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Kartana is meant to clean teams later on in games with the assistance of its ability, Beast Boost. Beast Boost lets it snowball Attack boosts and run through weakened teams. In addition, Choice Scarf Kartana functions as a revenge killer earlier on in games, outrunning and defeating or forcing out most common offensive threats in the metagame such as Greninja, Tapu Lele, and Keldeo. While locking into Defog is not particularly ideal, as Kartana has to switch out afterwards or become fodder, it is still convenient in some situations and should be used when entry hazards are proving to be problematic to your team during the early- to mid-game. Due to the fact that Swords Dance Kartana is the more common and threatening of the two sets, there are many occasions where you are facing an offensive team that lacks a true Kartana counter and you can take advantage of this via strategic utilization of this Kartana variant. Essentially, the opponent will often try to pivot to their faster, offensive checks that resist a certain move or predict you to use Swords Dance to break through a defensive pivot and Kartana can take advantage of this by hitting them with a strong attack right off the bat, making prediction easier to make, as you know it has to lock into a move.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Kartana is primarily used to clean up later on in games, so it should be paired with an early-game breaker that can poke holes and do significant damage to opposing defensive cores, such as Choice Band Tyranitar or Mega Medicham. Also, Spikes support is appreciated by Choice Scarf Kartana, as the residual damage does rack up on opposing teams over time, but it is worth noting that there is some awkward overlap with the fact that Kartana itself could have to use Defog to clear away its own Spikes depending upon the situation. Pursuit support is appreciated by this variant of Kartana as well, as Latios and Latias can get in the way of Kartana trying to sweep with Leaf Blade or Sacred Sword, which are its two most commonly used moves. Tapu Bulu is a great teammate, as Grassy Terrain lets you clean up late-game with Leaf Blade fairly often, and it also provides Kartana with a bit of recovery each turn. Finally, offensive teams often appreciate the presence of Choice Scarf Kartana much more than other archetypes, as it gives them a quick Defog user and compresses roles while also posing as a very valuable offensive Steel-type that happens to have a plethora of resistances.</p> "

        "name": "Paper Press (Choice Band)",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Leaf Blade is a strong STAB move after Kartana's sky-high Attack and Choice Band are factored in, taking down the likes of Toxapex, Gliscor, Tapu Bulu, and Clefable in two hits. The latter two are threatened by Smart Strike, but it just goes to show how risk-free Leaf Blade can be after Steel- and Flying-types are taken care of. Knock Off also hits very hard after a Choice Band boost, dealing big damage to Zapdos, Mega Latias, and Celesteela and removing Leftovers from walls, thus making Kartana's objective easier to accomplish. Knock Off notably allows Kartana to put defensive Landorus-T in the range of a 2HKO from Leaf Blade. Sacred Sword is an excellent tool for slashing through Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and opposing Kartana. Finally, Smart Strike provides solid neutral coverage alongside Kartana's other moves and takes care of the likes of Magearna, Tangrowth, and Mega Venusaur.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread alongside a Jolly nature maximizes Kartana's Speed and Attack, the most important stats for such a wallbreaker. Choice Band allows Kartana to have an absurd amount of raw power at the cost of being unable to switch moves. Beast Boost is Kartana's only ability, but it's a great one nonetheless, allowing Kartana to become nigh unstoppable after it claims a knockout.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Due to Choice Band locking Kartana into one move, it is important to predict your opponent's move to use Kartana to its fullest potential. Kartana has the tools to heavily threaten several balance and bulky offense teams, but good opponents will try to pivot around and circumvent its power, thus it's important to ponder risk and reward and keep up the prediction game to prevent your opponent from taking advantage of Kartana. Knock Off is usually a great move to spam early-game, as it does solid damage to most walls. Meanwhile, Leaf Blade is usually ideal to use later on, once Steel- and Flying-types are successfully weakened. Also, try to find opportunities to get Kartana in. It can be after one of your Pokemon has been knocked out, with the use of a slow U-turn or Volt Switch, or even on an expected switch from your opponent. For the latter, just be careful to not risk Kartana too much, as it will often be important to break your opponent's defensive core. For Kartana's success as a wallbreaker, try to keep entry hazards on your opponent's side of the field for as long as possible, since they really help Kartana's duty as a wallbreaker, allowing it to take down walls and enable teammates to seal the game down the line. Finally, Kartana shouldn't be used as a revenge killer, as even if it can outspeed and knock out a threat, it is still going to be locked into a move and taken advantage of, thus losing valuable momentum.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Magnezone is an excellent partner courtesy of its ability to trap and eliminate Mega Scizor, Celesteela, and Skarmory. Tapu Bulu, despite stacking weaknesses with Kartana, provides Grassy Terrain, which makes Kartana's Leaf Blade, especially when enhanced by Choice Band, all the more threatening, achieving feats such as 2HKOing defensive Landorus-T, Timid Zapdos, Magearna, and Jirachi. Entry hazard setters are excellent teammates to help wear down Kartana's few checks. Heatran and both Greninja formes synergize very well with Kartana offensively and can set Stealth Rock and Spikes, respectively. Other Stealth Rock setters, notably Clefable, Landorus-T, and Mega Tyranitar, also are great teammates for Kartana. Slow U-turn and Volt Switch users, such as defensive Landorus-T and Assault Vest Magearna, are great picks to give Kartana more opportunities to wallbreak, as Kartana is too frail to come in on most attacks. Balance archetypes featuring the likes of Clefable, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn can take advantage of Kartana being Choice-locked and pivot around it after the move it is locked into is known. Thus, breakers like Taunt Tornadus-T, Heatran, Mega Mawile, and Mega Medicham are great partners, all of which also appreciate Kartana taking down their checks. Late-game cleaners that can take advantage of Kartana's havoc are great picks as well; Hawlucha, Shift Gear Magearna, and Volcarona are all great options.</p> "

  "Magearna": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to its ability Soul-Heart, Magearna has the ability to snowball with Shift Gear sets, meaning that it is very hard to check late-game. It also has a great typing, which gives it resistances to common types like Fairy, Psychic, and Dark. This gives it good setup opportunities and allows it to function as a defensive check to Pokemon such as Clefable, Tapu Lele, Mega Alakazam, and Ash-Greninja. Magearna possesses a high base 130 Special Attack with an excellent movepool consisting of good moves like Fleur Cannon, Focus Blast, Calm Mind, Shift Gear, and Thunderbolt. Essentially, Magearna can pick its check and counters due to the variety of Z-Crystals it can viably run on offensive sets, such as Fairium Z, Steelium Z, and Electrium Z, which hit a wide variety of Pokemon. Additionally, Magearna has access to Volt Switch, which allows it to act as a defensive pivot and gain momentum. Unfortunately, Magearna lacks any sort of reliable recovery whatsoever, meaning it can be worn down with ease. This means that most Magearna sets, Assault Vest sets especially, are prone to Spikes, because they will have a hard time switching into Pokemon such as Ash-Greninja and Tapu Lele multiple times throughout the match. Mediocre Speed prior to setup also means Magearna is susceptible to common Pokemon such as Heatran, Landorus-T, and Garchomp.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Trick Room can be used on dedicated teams as an alternative setter with enough bulk and power to set Trick Room at least once or twice. This set can also be run on offensive teams as a late-game sweeper but is outclassed by Shift Gear sets in that regard. Explosion can be run on Assault Vest sets to do major damage to Volcarona. Alternatively, Energy Ball can also be run to catch Gastrodon and Mega Swampert off guard, but it doesn't offer much else.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Specially defensive Pokemon can be a major threat to Magearna. Toxapex only fears boosted Thunderbolt and Gigavolt Havoc, taking anything else rather comfortably. Chansey eats everything Magearna can throw at it with relative ease, with the exception of boosted Twinkle Tackle, and it also loses to Calm Mind and Pain Split variants. Assault Vest Magearna can be a good check to Shift Gear Magearna. Gastrodon can block Volt Switch and take any move from Magearna well besides boosted Twinkle Tackle or the rare Energy Ball. Amoonguss, Mega Venusaur, and Assault Vest Tangrowth can also deal with Magearna, only fearing select Calm Mind sets.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-type Pokemon resist Magearna's STAB attacks and threaten it with super effective coverage of their own. Volcarona can take any hit reasonably well from offensive sets and will KO back with Fire Blast. It can also use Assault Vest Magearna as setup bait. Heatran only fears Focus Blast, All-Out Pummeling, or an Electric Terrain-boosted Gigavolt Havoc. Pokemon such as Blacephalon can also take on Magearna well, though it can be KOed by Twinkle Tackle after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Pokemon such as Jirachi, Celesteela, Magearna, Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Mega Mawile are good checks to offensive Magearna sets. Jirachi and opposing Assault Vest or specially defensive Magearna can take any hit very comfortably from Shift Gear Magearna, and Jirachi also has the ability to recover health with the combination of Wish + Protect. Celesteela only fears Gigavolt Havoc from Magearna. Mega Scizor shrugs off any attack bar Hidden Power Fire or Gigavolt Havoc. Ferrothorn and Heatran both can take any hit bar All-Out Pummeling, though they can be heavily damaged by Hidden Power Fire or, in Heatran's case, Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor can potentially block Assault Vest Magearna's Volt Switch and threaten it out with Earthquake, but they don't take Fleur Cannon or Ice Beam very well. All of them fall over to Shift Gear Magearna's Ice Beam or Twinkle Tackle as well. Magearna can also run a Shuca Berry, which allows it to use them as set up bait or to pick them off with Fleur Cannon.</p> ",

        "name": "Shift Gear",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Thunderbolt allows Magearna to break past Toxapex and Celesteela if desired. Ice Beam allows Magearna to reliably hit Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, Tapu Bulu, and Tangrowth. Focus Blast hits sturdy Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn for super effective damage. It's preferred over Aura Sphere because of its superior damage output, allowing Magearna to 2HKO Ferrothorn, for example. Calm Mind is an option that allows Magearna to break past its usual checks such as Assault Vest Tangrowth.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Electrium Z allows Magearna to break past Toxapex and Celesteela. An Iapapa Berry can be run, giving Magearna recovery in a pinch and keeping it out of range of common priority attacks such as Bullet Punch and Water Shuriken. Shuca Berry is another alternative, allowing Magearna to set up on Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Garchomp. Fairium Z alongside Fleur Cannon can be run on Calm Mind sets, as it allows Magearna to overwhelm specially defensive checks such as Gastrodon and Tangrowth after a Calm Mind boost. Fightinium Z can also be run on Thunderbolt sets to break past Heatran and Ferrothorn reliably. Metronome is also an option for Magearna's attacks to consistently get stronger if its team already has another Z-Move user.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Magearna functions best as a late-game sweeper once the opposition is weakened. However, Magearna can also be used as a mid-game breaker, where it can be used more aggresively. If you intend to sweep with Magearna late-game, it is important to keep Magearna healthy throughout the match, as it may need to get multiple boosts to win. In addition, keeping Magearna healthy also prevents it from being revenge killed by priority moves such as Water Shuriken and Bullet Punch. You should attempt to weaken Toxapex before using Gigavolt Havoc because Toxapex can take an unboosted Gigavolt Havoc from full HP. Fightinium Z sets can afford to set up early if Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn are still healthy, because it can usually overwhelm them.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Psychic-types such as Mega Alakazam and Mega Latios are excellent teammates for Magearna because they can consistently switch into Toxapex and wear down Steel-types such as Heatran, Celesteela, and Assault Vest Magearna. Greninja and Ash-Greninja can be used to wear down Magearna's checks with Spikes. Greninja can also function as a dual entry hazard lead on hyper offense, additionally providing Toxic Spikes support. Tornadus-T can remove items from Pokemon such as Toxapex, Assault Vest Magearna, and Heatran. Furthermore, it also provides Defog support, which is useful to keep Magearna as healthy as possible. Dual screens from Tapu Koko or Aurora Veil support from Alolan Ninetales lets Magearna set up much more easily. Tapu Koko also provides Electric Terrain to potentially boost Magearna's Thunderbolt and Gigavolt Havoc.</p> "

        "name": "Heart Swap",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Heart Swap steals the stat boosts of setup sweepers like opposing Magearna, Mega Latias, Tapu Lele, Clefable, and Reuniclus, allowing Magearna to act as a solid check to these Pokemon. Pain Split gives Magearna some much-needed recovery while amassing chip damage on switch-ins like Heatran, opposing Assault Vest Magearna, and Ferrothorn. Volt Switch allows Magearna to generate momentum after it forces out a Pokemon that can't threaten it. Flash Cannon gives Magearna a decently powerful move to threaten the foe after stealing its boosts. In particular, it hits Fairy-types like Mega Mawile, Tapu Lele, and Clefable for good damage. Fleur Cannon is a more powerful alternative that also has some nice synergy with Heart Swap, being able to shift the Special Attack drop to the foe. However, the lower PP and inability to hit Mega Mawile and opposing Magearna make it a more niche option.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The listed HP and Defense investments allow Magearna to avoid the OHKO from offensive Landorus-T's Earthquake and Jolly Mega Medicham's High Jump Kick. The remaining EVs are pooled into Special Defense to make the set as sturdy of an answer to Pokemon like offensive Magearna, Mega Alakazam, and Tapu Lele as possible. 136 Speed EVs are an option to allow Magearna to outspeed Mega Mawile; however, the significant drop in Special Defense hurts Magearna's ability to check the Pokemon it should. 6 Speed IVs allow Magearna to underspeed Celesteela so Magearna can absorb Leech Seed or take a hit from it and safely pivot out into a teammate.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Magearna should be used to defensively check the likes of Mega Alakazam, Mega Latias, Tapu Lele, and opposing Magearna. Once these Pokemon are inevitably forced out, Magearna can create momentum by pivoting out with Volt Switch. Be sure to use Pain Split whenever Magearna is weakened so it can continue to keep the aforementioned Pokemon in check. However, this is not a blanket statement—due to Pain Split's nature, you must be cautious when using it. For example, if one of the opponent's Pokemon is also on low HP, you should anticipate them potentially attempting to bring it in on a suspected Pain Split to nullify the effects. Similarly, if the opponent has a Ground-type, it is likely that at some point they will try to block Volt Switch with it, especially if that Ground-type is Gliscor or Excadrill. Again, you should try to predict this and catch them by double switching out or using Pain Split if applicable. Ground-types like Landorus-T and Garchomp can also be punished with Flash Cannon. Spikes can put Magearna in range of attacks it wouldn't otherwise be, so you should attempt to remove them when possible before bringing Magearna in.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set can fit on a number of different teams, from bulky offense and balance to even stall teams, due to the important defensive niche it fulfills. This set invites in Heatran, so Pokemon that Magearna can bring in with Volt Switch to take advantage of it like Ash-Greninja, Mega Alakazam, and Garchomp are wonderful teammates. Support from the likes of Landorus-T, Tornadus-T, and Rotom-W is valuable threefold—they are immune to Ground-type moves, which Magearna struggles with, form a potent pivoting core with Magearna, and can remove Spikes from the field with Defog, which would otherwise severely cut into Magearna's ability to do its job. Pokemon like Zapdos and physically defensive Tangrowth can be used on balance and stall teams as answers to Ground-types, with the former also being able to remove hazards. Strong wallbreakers like Mega Medicham, Tapu Lele, and Mega Charizard X are great partners, as they appreciate Magearna's ability to safely pivot them in via Volt Switch. Magearna has great synergy with bulky Water- and Grass-types like Toxapex, Tapu Bulu, Tangrowth, and Tapu Fini—they all help out with Ash-Greninja, the Water-types can cover Fire-types like Heatran and Volcarona, and the Grass-types help with Ground-types like Landorus-T and Garchomp. Tapu Bulu and Tapu Fini get a special mention, as the former provides Grassy Terrain, giving Magearna extra passive recovery and weakening Earthquake, while the latter can remove Spikes with Defog.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Volt Switch helps Magearna perform its role as a pivot and maintain momentum for the team. Focus Blast hits Steel-types such as Heatran and Ferrothorn for super effective damage. Despite Aura Sphere's perfect accuracy, Focus Blast is still preferred for its higher damage output against Steel-types like Heatran and Ferrothorn. Hidden Power Fire reliably hits Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor and prevents them from using Magearna as bait to set Spikes or gain boosts. Ice Beam gives Magearna the ability to OHKO Ground-types like Landorus-T. It also prevents Gliscor from blocking Volt Switch, since it doesn't fear Fleur Cannon. Iron Head is used despite Magearna's lower Attack stat to beat Calm Mind users like Clefable, Magearna, and Mega Alakazam. However, Flash Cannon can be used if the aforementioned foes aren't issues.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>36 Speed EVs allow Magearna to outspeed uninvested Clefable, which gives it a good chance at beating Clefable. 22 Speed IVs without any Speed investment can be run to underspeed Celesteela, which allows Magearna to absorb Leech Seed for its teammates before pivoting out to them. If running Flash Cannon, a Calm nature should be used and the Speed EVs should be moved to Special Defense.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Magearna can switch into most special attackers, but it is prone to being worn down, so you should not overly rely on Magearna to blanket check every specially offensive threat. Generally, try not to switch Magearna in when Spikes are on the field, because they tend to chip it down quite easily. However, if a Ground-type is anticipated to switch in to block Volt Switch, Magearna can use Fleur Cannon or Ice Beam instead to get rid of them. If a Greninja is confirmed to be Protean, consider the risk of using Volt Switch on it because Greninja can use Spikes to block Volt Switch.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Defoggers like Tornadus-T, Landorus-T, and Tapu Koko can keep Spikes off the field for Magearna and also form a good VoltTurn core with it. Pokemon such as Landorus-T and physically defensive Tangrowth can check Ground-types such as Garchomp, Gliscor, and Choice Scarf Landorus-T, which Magearna tends to struggle against. Powerful wallbreakers such as Mega Medicham, Garchomp, and Kyurem-B appreciate Magearna's slow Volt Switch to get them into battle. Solid checks to Heatran such as Gliscor, Mega Alakazam, and Mega Latios are appreciated. Magearna can be run on rain teams, as it can switch into Psychic-types like Mega Alakazam and Tapu Lele and also weaken Ferrothorn with Focus Blast, which is often annoying to rain teams.</p> "

        "name": "Calm Mind + Pain Split",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind allows Magearna to break past Tangrowth, Toxapex, and, in conjunction with Pain Split, Chansey, all of which it would otherwise struggle against. Pain Split allows Magearna to get some health back when it's low on HP and damage whatever is in front of it. Fleur Cannon with Fairium Z allows Magearna to annihilate bulky threats like Tangrowth, Chansey, and Ferrothorn when boosted enough. Thunderbolt is the best coverage move Magearna can use, as it hits Toxapex and Celesteela super effectively as well as Heatran for neutral damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP EVs and 8 Special Defense EVs allow Magearna to survive two Focus Blasts from Mega Alakazam after Stealth Rock. 28 Defense EVs also allow Magearna to survive Landorus-T's Earthquake and Jolly Mega Medicham's High Jump Kick from full HP. While not always optimal, Magearna can use 96 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature to allow it to OHKO specially defensive Tapu Bulu with +1 Twinkle Tackle. With this spread, the rest of the EVs go into Defense or Special Defense to allow Magearna to more easily take Ground-type moves from Pokemon like Landorus-T and Gliscor, as well as attacks from Tapu Lele and Tornadus-T. Alternatively, Special Defense EVs can be used to sponge attacks from Mega Alakazam, Tornadus-T, and Tapu Lele more easily. Shuca Berry is an alternative option that allows Magearna to effectively lure and remove Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp at the cost of some of its offensive potential. Wiki Berry is another option to improve Magearna's longevity and allow it to more reliably check Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Mega Alakazam.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Magearna set works really well against defensive teams, as it can break through typical checks such as Chansey, Toxapex, and Gastrodon when boosted and can easily get multiple opportunities in a game to wallbreak thanks to Magearna's typing and the longevity Pain Split gives it. Magearna will usually find it impossible to sweep early- or mid-game against offensive teams, so in this matchup, it's usually best to use Magearna's fantastic defensive typing to sponge hits from threats like Mega Alakazam, Tapu Bulu, and Tornadus-T. Also, Twinkle Tackle hits incredibly hard even unboosted, which can allow Magearna to heavily damage or KO common switch-ins like Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Excadrill. Be careful of using Calm Mind when the opponent has a threat that can outspeed and heavily damage or OHKO Magearna. These threats include Landorus-T, Garchomp, Volcarona, and Heatran, among others. Volcarona can even use Magearna as setup fodder. Pain Split is best used to keep Magearna healthy, and with consistent use you can usually keep it at fairly high HP throughout a game. Magearna can damage typical switch-ins like Chansey and Heatran and recover health against them if played smartly. When low on health, Magearna can usually find a way to gain some health back to put it in range of surviving an attack.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon like Gliscor and Rotom-W can check Heatran well while also pressuring Landorus-T, which are two of Magearna's most common checks. Threats like Mega Tyranitar and Mega Mawile that can heavily pressure Ground-types are appreciated, since Magearna can't really sweep with one of them still active. Entry hazard setters like Ash-Greninja, Landorus-T, and Mega Diancie can really help with wearing down Heatran, which Magearna can struggle to break through. Mega Diancie is a particularly good partner, since it can wear down opposing Steel-types. Entry hazards can also help put Toxapex, opposing Magearna, and Ferrothorn into range of boosted Thunderbolt and Twinkle Tackle. Magearna hates Spikes and Stealth Rock, since they put it in range of moves like Landorus-T and Garchomp's Earthquake and Modest Heatran's Magma Storm. Defoggers like Gliscor and Rotom-W can check certain Landorus-T sets as well as Heatran, while Defog Tornadus-T helps wear down Heatran. Even though Magearna can take attacks from Garchomp and Landorus-T, it's generally not advised to do so. Thus, Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth can at least switch into them and sponge hits. Tapu Bulu also summons Grassy Terrain, which weakens Earthquake and also gives Magearna another source of recovery. They also take some of the pressure off Magearna by being able to switch into Ash-Greninja and, in Tapu Bulu's case, Mega Alakazam, as this variant of Magearna struggles to switch into these threats consistently.</p> "

  "Blacephalon": {
    "overview": "<p>Blacephalon is blessed with an outstanding Special Attack stat, which, coupled with its great offensive typing in Fire / Ghost, turns it into a deadly wallbreaker. Blacephalon sets itself apart from other special wallbreakers thanks to its high Speed stat, which lets it act as a late-game cleaner and revenge killer when equipped with a Choice Scarf and outspeed a fair amount of the metagame without a boosting item. On top of that, Blacephalon's Beast Boost ability can boost its Special Attack by one stage after each KO or can be tuned to boost its Speed, further bolstering its late-game cleaning capabilities. However, Blacephalon has an annoying vulnerability to every entry hazard and a weakness to Stealth Rock. It is also weak to common priority moves like Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken and Mega Mawile's Sucker Punch, which allows these Pokemon to stop a late-game sweep from it and gain momentum by forcing it out. Finally, the presence of Tyranitar as a top-tier threat in the metagame hurts Blacephalon's viability, since it's unable to 2HKO Tyranitar on the switch without prior damage and falls prey to Pursuit.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choice Scarf set can be run to take advantage of Blacephalon's good STAB combination and potential to clean up against offensively oriented teams. However, it's incredibly awkward to fit onto teams. Knock Off on Choice Specs Blacephalon lets it get rid of items like Chansey's Eviolite and Mantine's Leftovers without losing the breaking power of Choice Specs, which allows it to even 2HKO Chansey on the switch with Fire Blast.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Pursuit: Dark-types with access to Pursuit like Tyranitar and Weavile are a big nuisance for any Blacephalon set, since locking itself into a move they resist like Shadow Ball, or Flamethrower in Tyranitar's case, allows them to remove it from the game. Tyranitar in particular is quite troublesome because Blacephalon has no way to 2HKO it on the switch without prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Faster offensive Pokemon like Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Kartana all outspeed and OHKO Choice Specs Blacephalon, while faster Choice Scarf users like Greninja and Latios can deal with Choice Scarf variants.</p> <p><strong>Priority: Common priority moves like Water Shuriken from Ash-Greninja, Sucker Punch from Mega Mawile and Bisharp, and Shadow Sneak from Mimikyu force out Blacephalon pretty reliably, since it's not bulky enough to take any of those hits.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Water-types like Toxapex, Mantine, and Gastrodon resist Blacephalon's Fire STAB moves and aren't 2HKOed by Shadow Ball without prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Residual damage from entry hazards, weather, and poison all stack up pretty quickly and can severely cripple Blacephalon, especially Stealth Rock, since it loses 25% of its HP every time it switches in.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hidden Power Ground allows Blacephalon to 2HKO Choice Band Tyranitar and is being a safe option against Heatran. Hidden Power Grass 2HKOes Choice Band Tyranitar after some prior damage, OHKOes Greninja on the switch, and deals with Gastrodon. Trick is meant to cripple Chansey on the switch in the stall matchup, which makes it easier for Blacephalon's teammates to break through it. Overheat is a stronger alternative to Fire Blast that guarantees an OHKO on some Pokemon like defensive Landorus-T and Clefable, but its Special Attack drop means that Blacephalon will be usually forced out after using it. Flamethrower is another alternative that can be run for more reliability, but the power drop from Fire Blast to Flamethrower is pretty noticeable.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>While Beast Boost isn't as useful for a Choice Specs set because Blacephalon is usually forced out by a revenge killer after KOing a foe, it still can be helpful.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Specs Blacephalon will be switching in several times during a game, so keeping entry hazards off the field is a priority. Blacephalon is very frail, so it's going to need to be brought into the field with the aid of VoltTurn users to start punching holes in the opposing team. Since few Pokemon resist Shadow Ball, it's a pretty safe move to use most of the time when facing a foe that Blacephalon forces out, though you have to watch out for Pursuit users like Weavile that could take advantage of Shadow Ball and trap it. Finally, don't throw out attacks recklessly if there's a Tyranitar on the opponent's team; play smart until you manage to weaken it for Blacephalon.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Defog users like Tornadus-T, Tapu Fini, and Landorus-T take care of any entry hazards that would otherwise limit Blacephalon's switching opportunities. Pokemon with access to VoltTurn like Landorus-T, Tapu Koko, and Rotom-W are great teammates because they can bring Blacephalon safely onto the field. Defensive pivots to fall back on when forced out by an offensive threat, like defensive Landorus-T and Assault Vest Magearna, also make for great partners, especially if they are VoltTurn users that can get Blacephalon back onto the field easily. Teammates that pressure Tyranitar like Earthquake Mega Latios, Surf Latios, and Corkscrew Crash Heatran improve Blacephalon's matchup against Tyranitar teams by weakening or removing it from the game for Blacephalon to use its attacks safely. Finally, late-game cleaners that can capitalize on the holes Blacephalon punches, like Choice Scarf Kartana and Ash-Greninja, form a potent offensive core with it.</p> "

        "name": "Substitute + Calm Mind",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Flamethrower is Blacephalon's most reliable Fire-type STAB move due to its perfect accuracy, and it is chosen over Fire Blast because the extra power isn't needed. Shadow Ball is Blacephalon's best Ghost-type STAB move and provides great coverage because it has only one resistance and one immunity. Substitute eases prediction on switches, makes Blacephalon harder to revenge kill, and gives it a number of setup opportunities, such as turning Chansey into setup fodder with avoidance of Toxic and immunity to Seismic Toss. Calm Mind boosts Blacephalon's Special Attack and Special Defense, meaning it can pose as more of a threat to bulkier Pokemon and, in some situations, take some hits despite its frailty.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment in conjunction with a Timid nature is used to maximize Blacephalon's Speed. 20 Special Attack EVs give Blacephalon as much firepower as possible while keeping its Special Attack one point lower than its Speed to ensure Beast Boost boosts Blacephalon's Speed. The rest of the EVs are dumped into HP to improve Blacephalon's poor bulk, and the last 4 EVs are put into Defense as opposed to HP to ensure Blacephalon can use Substitute four times instead of three while letting it always survive Hawlucha's Acrobatics from full HP. Alternatively, a simple spread with 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe can be run to boost Blacephalon's Special Attack, improving its matchup against bulkier teams. Ghostium Z turns Shadow Ball into a 160-Base Power Never-Ending Nightmare, allowing it to bust through Pokemon that can otherwise take a hit such as Heatran, Garchomp, and Gliscor.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>In situations where Blacephalon is forcing a switch, it is often the correct play to get up a Substitute in order to ease prediction and make it harder for your opponent to revenge kill Blacephalon. Be sure to use Blacephalon's Z-Move to break through bulkier Pokemon that could otherwise take a hit from it in order to get a Speed boost and possibly sweep the opponent's team. Avoid letting foes afflict Blacephalon with paralysis or Toxic poison, as they severely hinder Blacephalon's offensive capabilities by making it very slow or putting it on a timer. It should be noted that this set lacks the power of other Blacephalon sets, so you'll need the opposing team to be weakened more than usual to attempt a sweep.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This Blacephalon set is used strictly on hyper offensive teams, as it has great matchups against both stall and offensive team archetypes, especially when it is behind Aurora Veil or Light Screen and Reflect. Entry hazard setters that fit on these offensive teams, such as Landorus-T, Greninja, and Excadrill, are great partners, as they can weaken Pokemon and put them in range of Blacephalon's attacks. Excadrill's ability to use Rapid Spin to remove entry hazards makes it a great partner, as Blacephalon is affected by every type of entry hazard. Pokemon such as Kartana and Mega Gyarados that can muscle past bulky Water-types, such as Toxapex, Gastrodon, Mantine, and Pyukumuku, are good assets to Blacephalon, as it struggles to break through these Pokemon, especially the former. Finally, Tapu Koko and Alolan Ninetales are wonderful teammates because they can set up either Light Screen and Reflect or Aurora Veil, respectively, for Blacephalon, making up for its poor bulk and giving it more setup opportunities.</p> "
