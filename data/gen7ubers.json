  "Aegislash": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>A Steel / Ghost typing makes Aegislash an excellent Xerneas and Mega Lucario check, and it cannot get trapped by Mega Gengar, Gothitelle, and Dugtrio.</li> <li>It can also check other powerful attackers like Deoxys-A, Tapu Lele, and non-Fire Blast Mewtwo.</li> <li>Aegislash isn't 2HKOed by any of Xerneas's coverage moves due to its good bulk, setting it apart from other Steel-type Xerneas answers.</li> <li>King's Shield allows Aegislash to punish physical attackers and play mind games with the opponent.</li> <li>It can punish its switch-ins like Primal Groudon, Yveltal, and Ho-Oh with Toxic.</li> <li>Aegislash also has decent damage output due to Blade forme's good attacking stats.</li> <li>However, many powerful and prominent physical attackers overwhelm Aegislash, including Primal Groudon, Marshadow, offensive Necrozma-DM, Arceus-Ground, physical Primal Kyogre, and physical Ultra Necrozma. The prevalence of these threats cuts into Aegislash's viability.</li> <li>It is also threatened by Dark-types like Yveltal, Arceus-Dark, and Darkrai.</li> <li>Having no reliable recovery outside of a possible Leftovers means that Aegislash can be worn down over the course of the match. Iron Ball is also the preferred item due to heavily increasing Gyro Ball's damage.</li> <li>Transforming into Blade forme and attacking at a bad time makes Aegislash open and vulnerable to attacks or setup. This causes it to have to switch or use King's Shield, which forfeits all momentum and gives the advantage to the opponent.</li> <li>Aegislash can be passive at times and become predictable with repeated use of King's Shield.</li> <li>Aegislash faces extreme competition from many other Steel-type Xerneas checks like Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, Celesteela, Necrozma-DM, and Magearna; the former four have better recovery options, and the latter two have more damage output.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Pursuit can trap threats like Mega Gengar, Mewtwo, Deoxys-A, Tapu Lele, and Choice-locked Lunala. However, running Pursuit over Shadow Ball leaves Aegislash vulnerable to Mega Lucario, something it is supposed to beat, and Alolan Muk, Deoxys-A, and Tyranitar are better Pursuit trappers.</li> <li>Shadow Sneak can pick off weakened Psychic-types, Lunala, and Marshadow. However, Shadow Sneak lacks damage output, and if it fails to KO the foe, Aegislash will be in Blade forme and thus is extremely vulnerable.</li> <li>Hidden Power Ice surprises Zygarde-C and Mega Salamence, but forgoing Shadow Ball makes Aegislash lose out on its ability to check Mega Lucario, which is one of its major selling points.</li> <li>Sacred Sword hits Ferrothorn, Dialga, and still lets it hit Mega Lucario, but does little to other Steel-types like Necrozma-DM and Celesteela.</li> <li>Head Smash OHKOes Ho-Oh and dents Primal Groudon, but also prevents Aegislash from checking Mega Lucario.</li> <li>If any of the above move options are chosen over Gyro Ball instead of Shadow Ball, remember to change Aegislash's item to Leftovers but still opt to run a Sassy nature with 0 Speed IVs, as outspeeding defensive walls when attacking will leave you vulnerable in Blade form. Take note that not running Gyro Ball prevents Aegislash from checking Xerneas properly.</li> <li>A Choice Specs set with Shadow Ball + Flash Cannon has decent damage output and can surprise the opponent, but Aegislash is very slow, and there are just better and more reliable special attackers like Deoxys-A, Xerneas, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Yveltal.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types</strong>: Primal Groudon hates switching into Toxic but can tank Aegislash's other attacks easily and threaten it out with Precipice Blades and Fire-type coverage or use it as setup bait. Ho-Oh also hates getting hit with Toxic, but it has Recover and Regenerator to mitigate the damage, and it can come in on Aegislash easily and OHKO it with Sacred Fire.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Coverage</strong>: Many Pokemon that Aegislash would normally beat carry super effective Fire-type coverage to hit it, such as Fire Blast Mewtwo, Heat Wave Ultra Necrozma, Naganadel, V-create Rayquaza, and various Fire Blast support Arceus formes.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types like Primal Groudon, Landorus-T, and Arceus-Ground threaten Aegislash with their super effective STAB moves. They are crippled by Toxic, however. Aegislash also succumbs to super effective Ground-type coverage, such as Earthquake from Extreme Killer Arceus, Necrozma-DM, physical Ultra Necrozma, and Mega Mewtwo X and Earth Power from Arceus-Fairy.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde-C: Zygarde-C is able to switch into Aegislash extremely easily and can threaten it with Thousand Arrows or use it as setup fodder. Also, Zygarde-C doesn't care about Toxic because it can use Rest to get rid of it. However, it must be wary of a potential Hidden Power Ice.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Yveltal threatens Aegislash with a super effective Dark Pulse, has Oblivion Wing to recover HP, and can Taunt Aegislash to prevent it from using King's Shield. Arceus-Dark can use Refresh to get rid of Toxic poison, use Aegislash as setup bait, and force it out with Judgment. Alolan Muk walls Aegislash completely, as it's immune to Toxic, and it can threaten Aegislash with Knock Off. Mega Sableye can switch into Aegislash easily, as Magic Bounce prevents Aegislash from using Toxic, and can threaten it with Foul Play and Will-O-Wisp. Darkrai 2HKOes Aegislash with Dark Pulse, but it is 2HKOed by Gyro Ball. However, all of these Dark-types do not like switching into Toxic, with the exception of Alolan Muk and Mega Sableye. Mega Sableye is also hit neutrally by Shadow Ball.</p> <p><strong>Steel- and Poison-types: Steel- and Poison-types such as Dialga, Ferrothorn, Celesteela, Alolan Muk, and Toxapex are immune to Toxic and are able to switch into Aegislash extremely easily, barring Necrozma-DM. Ferrothorn and Celesteela can wear Aegislash down with Leech Seed. Ferrothorn and Toxapex can use it as fodder to set up entry hazards. Alolan Muk walls Aegislash and can threaten it with Knock Off, and Dialga can come in easily and threatens Aegislash with Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Necrozma-DM: Necrozma-DM's offensive sets can take one Shadow Ball, set up on Aegislash, and beat it with Earthquake, especially Weakness Policy variants. However, Necrozma-DM takes a decent chunk of damage from Shadow Ball, making switching in risky unless it has Weakness Policy. Aegislash can also survive an unboosted Earthquake, so if the one-on-one is played badly, Aegislash can 2HKO it with Shadow Ball. Aegislash also beats defensive Necrozma-DM variants, since it is hit decently hard with Shadow Ball and cannot threaten Aegislash in return other than setting up Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Ghost-types</strong>: Most offensive Ghost-types such as Giratina-O, Lunala, Marshadow, and Arceus-Ghost threaten Aegislash. Giratina-O and Arceus-Ghost both have access to Shadow Force, which Aegislash is unable to block with King's Shield. Lunala can come in on Aegislash and threaten it with Moongeist Beam. Marshadow is able to heavily damage Aegislash with Spectral Thief and even bypass King's Shield with a Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike. However, all of these Ghost-types are crippled by Toxic and dented by Shadow Ball on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre: Offensive and physical Primal Kyogre variants can switch into Aegislash rather easily, only fearing Toxic, and can 2HKO Aegislash with Origin Pulse, Liquidation, or Earthquake or use it as setup fodder. Defensive Primal Kyogre sets don't care about Toxic, as most carry Rest to get rid of it, and they can dent Aegislash with Scald and potentially burn it.</p> ",

It also chips at Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM, hits other Psychic-types for decent damage, OHKOes Lunala without Shadow Shield, and OHKOes Marshadow after Stealth Rock damage.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment is used to consistently check Xerneas.</li> <li>4 Special Attack EVs allow Aegislash to 2HKO standard Double Dance Necrozma-DM after Stealth Rock damage, provided Necrozma-DM has no Weakness Policy and Aegislash outplays Necrozma-DM in a one-on-one scenario with proper use of King's Shield and Shadow Ball.</li> <li>A Sassy nature and 0 Speed IVs are used so Gyro Ball does maximum damage.</li> <li>Iron Ball is used to allow Aegislash to 2HKO offensive Arceus-Ground, Geomancy Xerneas, boosted Z-Geomancy Xerneas, and offensive Yveltal with Gyro Ball.</li> <li>Alternatively, Leftovers gives Aegislash passive recovery so it's less prone to being worn down.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Switch Aegislash in on Pokemon it checks, such as Xerneas, Mega Lucario, Tapu Lele, and support Arceus formes like Arceus-Water.</li> <li>With Leftovers, Aegislash is able to gradually make up the damage it takes from unboosted Xerneas, so Aegislash can be switched into Xerneas often and without risk.</li> <li>Avoid taking hits in Blade forme because its defenses are very low.</li> <li>Repeated and predictable use of King's Shield should be avoided; if the opponent reads it, then Aegislash is vulnerable and they receive a free turn.</li> <li>Note that using Toxic does not make Aegislash go into Blade forme; it will stay in Shield Forme.</li> <li>Also note that King's Shield fails against Shadow Force; it won't block the move nor drop the user's Attack.</li> <li>Aegislash should avoid status effects, particularly burns, as they hinder its ability to check Xerneas.</li> <li>Use Toxic liberally when punishing switch-ins like Primal Groudon and support Arceus formes, as its other moves don't do much damage.</li> <li>Shadow Ball can be used to chip away at Aegislash's switch-ins that are immune to Toxic or have already been poisoned by it. It should also be used against Mega Lucario to discourage it from setting up.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Aegislash is a specialized utility Pokemon that fits the demands of your team, so it shouldn't be built around.</li> <li>It should be used on teams that require a reliable defensive check to Xerneas. Pokemon that appreciate a Xerneas check include Yveltal, Mega Salamence, Rayquaza, Zygarde-C, Arceus-Dark, and Darkrai.</li> <li>A good Primal Groudon check is nigh mandatory because Aegislash's best way of dealing with it is Toxic. Zygarde-C, Arceus-Ground, Lugia, Primal Kyogre, and Mega Salamence can all deal with Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Arceus-Water is an excellent partner, as it can remove entry hazards and check Primal Groudon and other Ground- and Fire-types. In return, Aegislash is able to deal with Xerneas and powerful Psychic-type special attackers like Deoxys-A and non-Fire Blast Mewtwo.</li> <li>A secondary Xerneas check such as Primal Groudon or Ho-Oh is useful in order to relieve pressure off of Aegislash.</li> <li>Extreme Killer Arceus, Dialga, and many Dark-types appreciate Aegislash's ability to check Fighting-types .</li> <li>Pokemon weak to special attacking Psychic-types like some support Arceus formes, Naganadel, and Toxapex also value Aegislash.</li> <li>Cleric and Wish support from Xerneas, Blissey, and Clefable can keep Aegislash healthy to continue to check Xerneas.</li> <li>Mega Salamence, Yveltal, Giratina-O, and Rayquaza can switch into and threaten Ground-types.</li> <li>Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, Primal Kyogre, and Tyranitar threaten Fire-types like Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Dark-types like Yveltal, Arceus-Dark, and Alolan Muk are able to deal with Ghost-types like Marshadow. Aegislash checks Mega Lucario for them in return.</li> <li>Xerneas, Marshadow, and Mega Lucario check Dark-types.</li> <li>Fairy-types like Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy also deal with Dark-types and appreciate Aegislash's ability to check Mega Lucario.</li> <li>Entry hazard removal from Lugia, Giratina-O, Yveltal, or a support Arceus forme is nice for allowing Aegislash to switch in more freely and often.</li> </ul> "

  "Tapu Koko": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Despite its low base stats, Tapu Koko secures its place on some teams with a number of unique utility options thanks to its typing, movepool, and ability.</li> <li>Tapu Koko's Electric / Fairy typing enables it to pivot into Yveltal and offensively check it. While more prominent Fairy-types like Xerneas and Magearna can do the same, Xerneas needs to run Choice Scarf and lock itself into a move to effectively check Yveltal, while Magearna struggles to maintain momentum afterward due to Ground-types blocking Volt Switch. Unlike the aforementioned Fairy-types, Tapu Koko can cause further disturbance by using U-turn and generating momentum on forced switches, hindering switch-ins with Nature's Madness and potentially Taunt.</li> <li>This typing also enables Tapu Koko to completely anti-lead Smeargle, preventing it from setting any entry hazards and using other utility options, as Smeargle commonly uses Nuzzle as a countermeasure against Taunt users. This contributes to Tapu Koko's viability to a degree, as said trait strongly improves Tapu Koko's team's matchup against specialized offensive archetypes and enables it to justify running a dedicated lead set using dual screens.</li> <li>Electric Surge is another unique trait that proves to be handy in many situations. Apart from making Tapu Koko's Electric-type attacks stronger, the Terrain preventing sleep can prove to be a serious annoyance for defensive teams, where some crucial Pokemon like Giratina are reliant on Rest for recovery. Boosting Electric-type moves is also relevant for Xerneas, helping it bypass Necrozma-DM and Ho-Oh with a boosted Thunder.</li> <li>There is a considerable amount of opportunity cost from using Tapu Koko even accounting for its utilities, however, as even when it is running an offensive set, Tapu Koko struggles to do much damage. While a combination of a Z-Move, Nature's Madness, Taunt, and U-turn can theoretically annoy most of the tier, all of these moves require flawless predictions to be effective. As common teams that Tapu Koko fits on cannot afford to lose momentum, Tapu Koko is also forced to use suboptimal moves like U-turn even in favorable matchups to evade chances it gets taken advantage of by potential switch-ins.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Focus Sash can enable Tapu Koko to survive a hit when setting dual screens, but Tapu Koko can already survive a good number of attacks once with HP investment, and extended turns of screens from Light Clay is much more worthwhile.</li> <li>Grass Knot and Hidden Power Ice are options to punish Ground-types, but it is usually better for Tapu Koko to punish as many threats as possible with Nature's Madness.</li> <li>Zap Plate on offensive sets gives Tapu Koko enough power to 2HKO maximum HP Arceus formes and OHKO Primal Kyogre and Arceus-Water. However, forgoing Electrium Z means Tapu Koko forgoes an option to OHKO offensive Necrozma-DM and Mega Salamence as well as defensive Ho-Oh.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Primal Groudon, Zygarde, and Arceus-Ground are all nuisances for Tapu Koko despite the fact that they can be punished by Nature's Madness, as they can simply switch in and make Tapu Koko waste its Z-Move. These Pokemon can also run offensive sets, which forces Tapu Koko into predictions when setting a screen, and potentially set up to threaten other Pokemon behind screens as well.</p> <p><strong>Faster Foes: Deoxys-S and Mega Mewtwo Y are faster than Tapu Koko, and they can prevent it from setting screens with Taunt. Other faster foes like Choice Scarf Xerneas can easily remove Tapu Koko with minimal or no prior damage due to its poor bulk.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves: Priority move users like Marshadow, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Rayquaza can easily pick off slightly damaged Tapu Koko with their priority moves. Some of these Pokemon have access to setup moves and are able to naturally 2HKO Tapu Koko before it sets dual screens, thus either limiting it to setting a single screen or forcing it to take a risk and use Taunt to prevent setup.</p> <p><strong>Foes that Resist Electric: There are a myriad of Pokemon that resist Electric, including Grass-types like Ferrothorn, Mega Venusaur, and Arceus-Grass and Dragon-types like Giratina-O and Dialga that can easily take Gigavolt Havoc with their resistance and high bulk. Note that none of these Pokemon appreciate switching into Nature's Madness, and Tapu Koko can choose to sacrifice itself to prevent recovery or utility moves by using Taunt in a pinch.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye: Tapu Koko is typically reliant on Taunt to have an advantage over many slower foes, and Mega Sableye's Magic Bounce tends to make it think twice before using Taunt. This means Tapu Koko will struggle to do much other setting dual screens, and Mega Sableye can threaten to status an incoming teammate by switching in when screens are being set. Though offensive Tapu Koko can threaten to 2HKO it with Thunder, the matchup becomes generally unreliable after Tapu Koko has used its Z-Move due to Thunder's inaccuracy.</p> ",

        "name": "Dual Screens",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Tapu Koko's ability to anti-lead Smeargle, outspeed and Taunt many Pokemon, and potentially generate momentum using U-turn makes it an acceptable user of dual screens.</li> <li>Reflect is the optimal screen to be set against leads with physical attackers to ease Tapu Koko's teammates' matchup against them and reducing the damage of many priority moves.</li> <li>Light Screen is a better screen to set against special attackers to hinder their ability to inflict damage. It can be helpful against support Arceus formes, Xerneas, and more.</li> <li>Taunt is used to shut down slower Pokemon like Smeargle and Ferrothorn, preventing them from setting their own entry hazards. Shutting down defensive threats can also provide Tapu Koko's team with a better opportunity to set up, as Taunted foes will struggle to damage setup sweepers behind screens support.</li> <li>U-turn is used to bring in a teammate after Tapu Koko has successfully set up screens, potentially catching a foe switching out in the process and thus helping to create a favorable matchup. The chip damage can also be handy with breaking Focus Sash from opposing leads like Smeargle that have been crippled by Taunt.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature enables Tapu Koko to take full advantage of its high Speed, letting it outspeed Arceus formes, reliably set Reflect in front of Marshadow, and prevent slower foes like Mega Salamence from setting up on it.</li> <li>Maximum HP investment gives Tapu Koko a small but needed bulk boost, giving it a good chance to survive Precipice Blades from offensive Primal Groudon and enabling it to always survive said move from defensive variants behind Reflect. Other crucial benchmarks for maximum HP include guaranteed survival of Xerneas's Moonblast and the 2HKO from support Arceus formes' neutral Judgment in a one-on-one scenario.</li> <li>Light Clay makes Reflect and Light Screen last for eight turns instead of five, aiding setup sweepers like Zygarde that may take a bit longer to set up.</li> <li>Electric Surge summons Electric Terrain, which can benefit teammates like Xerneas using Electric-type coverage moves and prevents sleep.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>This set serves one purpose: setting screens to ease teammates' attempts to set up and sweep effectively. Set appropriate screens and safely bring in an appropriate teammate with U-turn.</li> <li>Depending on what foe an opponent leads with, it may be difficult to decide which screen will be appropriate to set. For example, Arceus-Ground and Primal Kyogre can potentially be running a physical or special set, and many Primal Groudon variants are mixed, so a wrong prediction will usually limit Tapu Koko to setting only one screen. Analyze what attacks can Tapu Koko's teammates can take better and set screens to weaken attacks that teammates can't take well. This means setting Reflect against Primal Groudon lacking Hidden Power Ice can be better for teammates like Zygarde and Rayquaza that can easily take Overheat, and setting Light Screen against support Arceus formes can be helpful for Xerneas and Extreme Killer Arceus attempting to set up on them.</li> <li>Note that while using Taunt can prevent Defog users from removing screens and setup sweepers from getting out of hand, this often involves a risk. Tapu Koko has enough bulk to survive an attack and prevent the likes of Geomancy Xerneas and bulkier Zygarde from setting up on it, but it is usually safer to set screens on threats like Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground instead despite their ability to carry setup moves.</li> <li>While this set's lack of offensive presence may make it seem helpless against defensive teams, it can prove to be useful by crippling defensive foes with Taunt, hindering certain Pokemon by preventing Rest with Electric Terrain, and drawing in Mega Sableye and making a favorable matchup with U-turn. Defensive teams also tend to rely on support Arceus formes to shut down dangerous threats like such as Zygarde, Arceus-Ground, and Primal Groudon, so screens can come in handy by making them much harder to stop. Screens support is especially beneficial for the former two due to their ability to fully take advantage of screens behind Substitute.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>The damage reduction from dual screens is very helpful to most offensive archetypes, as it potentially allows many Pokemon to set up on threats without taking too much damage.</li> <li>Setup sweepers that are naturally bulky, such as Primal Groudon and Xerneas, will be significantly harder to take down when they are behind screens. Primal Groudon can potentially benefit from defensive Zygarde and Giratina's reduced longevity due to Electric Terrain preventing Rest, while Xerneas can use Electric Terrain-boosted Thunder after Geomancy boosts to bypass Ho-Oh and offensive Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Substitute users like Zygarde and Arceus-Ground become even more problematic to offensive teams, as they can reliably set up on various foes while avoiding status. Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Flying packing Refresh are also worthy of consideration in certain matchups where the opposing team doesn't have much security against bulky setup sweepers.</li> <li>Various wallbreakers can find room to breathe with dual screen support. This means powerhouses like Primal Kyogre and Yveltal will be harder to handle and will have a superior matchup against their usual checks. Primal Kyogre is especially helpful with punishing Ground-types that Tapu Koko draws in.</li> <li>Entry hazards facilitate any setup sweepers' attempt to sweep. Offensive setters like Primal Groudon and Dialga can have their matchup against support Arceus formes significantly improved with dual screen support.</li> <li>Pokemon that can provide some security against setup sweepers are needed, as foes like Rock Polish Primal Groudon and offensive Zygarde and Arceus-Ground variants may get out of hand while Tapu Koko attempts to set the screen. Priority move users like Marshadow and Extreme Killer Arceus can be considered to alleviate this issue.</li> </ul> "

Checks that lack reliable recovery, such as Primal Groudon and Giratina-O, are especially punished harsher if switched into said move.</li> <li>Roost can be considered to let Tapu Koko be a more reliable switch-in to Yveltal and worry less about passive foes' retaliation after Taunt, but it is hard to fit into this set.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximized Speed EVs and a Timid nature make Tapu Koko as fast as possible, letting it outspeed support Arceus formes and Mega Salamence while Speed tying with Mega Gengar.</li> <li>8 Defense EVs let Tapu Koko survive +1 Double-Edge from Adamant Mega Salamence from full HP. The rest of the EVs are invested into Special Attack to maximize Tapu Koko's damage output.</li> <li>Electric Surge strengthens Tapu Koko's Electric-type STAB attacks and hinders Pokemon like Giratina that rely on Rest.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>This variant of Tapu Koko primarily focuses on offensively checking threats it can hit hard with Electric-type attacks and generating momentum on forced switches. However, due to a large number of Pokemon that can easily take Electric-type attacks, this task will demand a series of accurate predictions to be successful.</li> <li>Tapu Koko will rely on the inaccurate Thunder after using Gigavolt Havoc. This means prioritize observing how an opponent reacts to Tapu Koko, and Tapu Koko should rather focus on securing momentum, as most of its checks like Primal Groudon and Zygarde can become very threatening with a single misprediction.</li> <li>In some cases, instead of relying on making correct predictions, it is better to weaken foes that check Tapu Koko, particularly Ground-types, to ease Tapu Koko's pivoting. Consider using U-turn to create favorable matchups and Nature's Madness to weaken checks on the switch.</li> <li>As Tapu Koko draws in many threatening setup sweepers, use Taunt to prevent them from gaining enough boosts to make a sweep. This is a worthwhile move, especially if Tapu Koko made a misprediction and gave a free switch.</li> <li>Lack of much defensive presence means Tapu Koko will naturally make its team weaker to Ground-types by its typing and the conventional teammates it has to be used with. Use sources like entry hazards and aggressive predictions to prevent Ground-types from switching into Tapu Koko too liberally.</li> <li>Defensive teams will have multiple Pokemon that Tapu Koko can easily prey on. Taunt can shut down various walls, Electric Terrain can hinder Rest users like Giratina, and Electric-type attacks can threaten Ho-Oh, Lugia, Skarmory, and Arceus-Water. While the consequences for misprediction aren't as dire as against offensive teams, it is crucially important to take more thoughtful actions to allow Tapu Koko to fulfill its role.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Tapu Koko's tendency to draw in Ground-types and other foes that resist Electric can somewhat help it support its team, as it can pivot out with U-turn on predicted switches and create favorable matchups. Offensive partners like Zygarde, Arceus-Ground, and Mega Salamence can take advantage of Primal Groudon that Tapu Koko lures in or even additionally weakens with Nature's Madness, while Primal Kyogre can additionally punish opposing Arceus-Ground. Most of the checks for the aforementioned teammates can be weakened by Nature's Madness.</li> <li>Entry hazards can help Tapu Koko punish forced switches and wear down a good portion of its checks. As Tapu Koko typically finds its place on offensive teams, Cloyster and Deoxys-S can provide entry hazard support.</li> <li>Primal Groudon, depending on the variant, can provide Stealth Rock support, overpower Tapu Koko's checks with Swords Dance, or destroy offensive teams with Rock Polish. From bulkier teams' perspective, counterplay against Primal Groudon generally becomes narrower,(AC) as Giratina and Zygarde-C cannot heal themselves with Rest due to Electric Terrain. Tapu Koko can threaten Arceus-Water, Primal Kyogre, and Ho-Oh and put a huge dent in Giratina-O with Nature's Madness.</li> <li>As Tapu Koko struggles to do much against faster foes, and it can weaken bulky foes like support Arceus formes and Giratina-O, offensive partners like Marshadow and Extreme Killer Arceus can improve the matchup against offensive teams.</li> <li>More specialized teammates like Zekrom and Arceus-Electric can benefit from Electric Terrain, as it makes their STAB Electric-type attacks immensely powerful. Note that both of them stack weaknesses with Tapu Koko and thus make the team more loose against Ground-types overall.</li> </ul> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Shadow Ball is a decent option to OHKO the rare Lunala after Stealth Rock and do more damage to Necrozma-DM but is generally useless otherwise.</li> <li>Grass Knot finds a use on the Choice Scarf set because it 2HKOes Arceus-Water and Arceus-Ground, does more damage to Primal Kyogre, and is a decent option for hitting Primal Groudon outside of Terrain, but other than that it doesn't do much.</li> <li>Psychium Z can be used for an offensive nuke to destroy some common switch-ins, but Necrozma-DM still takes little damage from the attack and can recover off the damage.</li> <li>An offensive Calm Mind set can work, but even with Calm Mind, Tapu Lele can't break past most bulky Steel-types.</li> <li>Focus Blast can be used on the Choice Scarf set over Hidden Power Fire, as it does more damage to Necrozma-DM and most other Steel-types. However, the accuracy can be infuriating and the narrow target range makes Hidden Power Fire the preferred choice most of the time.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Necrozma-DM</strong>: Tapu Lele's STAB attacks are rendered impotent against Necrozma-DM's bulk, Sunsteel Strike will OHKO no matter what, and Necrozma-DM possesses recovery in Morning Sun, which allows it to mitigate Nature's Madness.</p> <p><strong>Other Steel-types</strong>: Most Steel-types either possess the Speed to outspeed and KO Tapu Lele outright or possess enough bulk to easily take Tapu Lele's moves barring Nature's Madness. For example, Ferrothorn and Celesteela can set up or OHKO Tapu Lele with Steel STAB moves, Mega Lucario outspeeds and OHKOes with Meteor Mash but loses to Choice Scarf Tapu Lele, and Magearna laughs at any of its moves. Even the less viable Steel-types like Mega Metagross and Arceus-Steel can easily dispose of Tapu Lele due to outspeeding it and resisting its STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh: Ho-Oh takes all of Tapu Lele's attacks, can OHKO or 2HKO back, and can utilize Regenerator to bypass Taunt if Stealth Rock isn't up.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Mega Gengar can come in on everything barring Psychic and traps Tapu Lele, easily OHKOing it with Sludge Wave.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: Primal Kyogre has enough special bulk to withstand any of Tapu Lele's moves and can easily OHKO with Water STAB moves, but it lacks recovery, allowing it to be worn down.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Yveltal and Arceus-Dark naturally outspeed Tapu Lele and are immune to Psychic. However, Yveltal can't OHKO without Stealth Rock unless it is using Choice Specs and has a chance to be OHKOed by Moonblast even without Stealth Rock, while Arceus-Dark is 2HKOed as well and doesn't OHKO in return, though it tends to fair better due to better bulk.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Tapu Lele's lack of bulk leads to it getting OHKOed or 2HKOed by any offensive threat faster than it. However, most of these Pokemon are frail as well, meaning Tapu Lele can 2HKO or OHKO them if using the Choice Scarf set, as otherwise the Speed advantage is lost.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Psychic benefits from Psychic Surge and is Tapu Lele's strongest neutral attack, 2HKOing Primal Groudon, support Arceus formes hit neutrally by it after Stealth Rock, and most Xerneas.</li> <li>Moonblast hits Dark-types like Yveltal, which are immune to Psychic, and Dragon-types like Rayquaza, Ultra Necrozma, and Giratina-O harder than Psychic would.</li> <li>Nature's Madness hits bulky threats that take little damage from Tapu Lele's other attacks like Steel-types, Chansey, Blissey, and Ho-Oh, providing more chip damage for Tapu Lele's partners.</li> <li>Taunt blocks setup, entry hazard stacking, recovery, and Defog, which is useful at shutting down support Pokemon and more passive threats. Taunt can also be used on the recovery turn for Nature's Madness targets, but be careful of threats that can KO Tapu Lele back such as Ho-Oh and defensive Necrozma-DM.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>The EVs and nature maximize Special Attack and Speed, as investing in defenses isn't worth it and Tapu Lele wants to outspeed as much as possible.</li> <li>Terrain Extender gives Tapu Lele three more Psychic Terrain turns that it and its team can utilize.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>As stated earlier, Tapu Lele is frail, causing it to get 2HKOed or OHKOed by a lot of strong neutral attacks, so be careful switching it in.</li> <li>If you don't have an idea of what foe is going to come in, Nature's Madness is the simple solution, as it hits anything for 50% and no Pokemon are immune to it.</li> <li>Utilize Taunt and Nature's Madness to cripple and force out passive threats with few ways to deal direct damage such as Lugia, Chansey, and Blissey.</li> <li>If Tapu Lele's partner can sweep the opposing team, you can sacrifice Tapu Lele to ensure Psychic Terrain is up and to give its partner a chance to come in. Remember that Tapu Lele's main job is to support its team with Psychic Surge.</li> <li>While Tapu Lele's physical bulk is terrible, it actually has enough special bulk to take a decent hit or two. For example, with no investment, Tapu Lele survives a Dark Pulse from Timid 252 SpA Life Orb Yveltal after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Tapu Lele is one of the best anti-leads versus Mega Sableye, preventing it from Mega Evolving due to possessing Fairy STAB moves and being immune to Fake Out, making it much harder for the opponent to bring it in later. This set also has good matchups versus a lot of stall Pokemon in general due to Taunt combined with Nature's Madness ignoring their bulk.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Tapu Lele cores usually only work on offensive builds due to lack of overall bulk and the offensive power awarded by Psychic Terrain; however, your build is usually different depending on which partner you choose due to them having specific checks unique to eachother.</li> <li>Fast and powerful Psychic-types make obvious partners, with the ideal ones being Deoxys-A with its massive attacking stats, Psychic STAB moves, and vulnerability to priority and Ultra Necrozma with its overwhelmingly powerful Z-Move and access to Swords Dance and Calm Mind. Other partners can be used, however; the only prerequisite is having a powerful Psychic-type STAB move.</li> <li>Sticky Web works wonders with Psychic Terrain, robbing the slowed Pokemon of their priority attacks and giving you a better chance to sweep. If you are not running Sticky Web, Magearna is almost a required teammate due to it providing a hard answer to Xerneas and Yveltal.</li> <li>Primal Groudon beats Ferrothorn, specially defensive Necrozma-DM, Magearna, Celesteela, and Skarmory, while Arceus-Ground beats offensive Necrozma-DM, Magearna, and Mega Lucario, Steel-types that Tapu Lele and its partners would want gone.</li> <li>Mega Salamence checks physical threats and Ground-types without Ice coverage both offensively and defensively with Intimidate and can threaten to sweep with Dragon Dance or remove entry hazards with Defog.</li> <li>Other fast but frail Pokemon can benefit from the priority-nullifying properties of Psychic Terrain. However, it should be said that building too much around Psychic Surge can hamper your team if Tapu Lele is KOed early.</li> <li>U-turn support is not required but can be useful for getting Tapu Lele in unscathed.</li> <li>Bulky Fairy-types pair well with Tapu Lele and its typical partners, as they can take hits from Yveltal and KO back.</li> </ul> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Psychic does around 50% to Primal Groudon and neutral support Arceus sets and is Tapu Lele's strongest move. Keep in mind that being locked into Psychic leaves Tapu Lele vulnerable to Dark-types such as Arceus-Dark and Yveltal. Psyshock can be run instead and performs with much the same function. However, Tapu Lele loses the aforementioned 2HKOs in exchange for hitting Ho-Oh and Primal Kyogre harder.</li> <li>Moonblast hits Dark-types, which are immune to Psychic, and does more damage to Dragon-types, and no Pokemon is immune to it. A notable target is Yveltal, which is OHKOed if it runs an offensive set and 2HKOed with a defensive one.</li> <li>Aromatherapy provides cleric support, which is useful on offensive teams to remove status.</li> <li>Hidden Power Fire is arguably Tapu Lele's best option for hitting Steel-types. However, most of them have the bulk to easily absorb it if they aren't already at low HP. Keep in mind that this move is weak against any other target and usually a bad idea to stay locked into.</li> <li>Nature's Madness can be run over Aromatherapy or Hidden Power Fire. However, keep in mind that it is impossible to get KOs if Tapu Lele is locked into it and it is overall less effective on this set than on the other set.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Tapu Lele to maximize its damage output and outspeed neutral-natured Choice Scarf Xerneas and Yveltal as well as a neutral-natured +1 Rayquaza while Speed tying with Jolly sets.</li> <li>Choice Scarf turns Tapu Lele into an effective revenge killer that has the perk of being practically immune to priority, allowing it to beat threats such as Mega Lucario, Rayquaza, and Marshadow regardless of its current HP.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Utilize this set to beat fast but frail Pokemon that would otherwise end up being an annoyance for your team such as Marshadow, setup sweepers with priority, and +1 124 Speed Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Tapu Lele's lack of bulk means switching it into offensive moves is a risk. Try to switch on predicted priority moves, on moves that don't deal damage such as Recover or a Dragon-type move, or after another Pokemon faints.</li> <li>The support set can be faked, which can end up surprising many would-be offensive checks such as Marshadow and netting a KO. However, keep in mind that this set can be revealed by Psychic Terrain lasting only 5 turns.</li> <li>Keep in mind that when you're using this set with a team designed around Psychic Terrain, sacrificing Tapu Lele too early can end badly.</li> <li>Tapu Lele makes a great anti-lead to Mega Sableye, being able to force it out in the lead matchup without letting it Mega Evolve; however, this set fares worse against stall teams in general due to its inability to switch moves and lack of the offensive power to blow through them with a single attack.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>The loss of three Psychic Terrain turns hurts your team's ability to take advantage of it. However, a Psychic Terrain core is still possible and allows the typical partners to operate more freely. For example, Deoxys-A can run Extreme Speed without it being a useless move most of the time.</li> <li>Pokemon that fit with the above set also work with this set; however, they may be played differently. For example, Magearna has some pressure taken off of it, as Tapu Lele tends to beat Yveltal and Xerneas one-on-one provided it uses the correct moves, and a Ground-type teammate should be switched in more, as this set is even worse against Steel-types.</li> <li>This set typically fits on Psychic Terrain builds that would appreciate a decently powerful Fairy-type revenge killer but can't spare a slot for Choice Scarf Xerneas. Choice Scarf Tapu Lele can be run on its own without building around Psychic Terrain, but Xerneas is usually the better pick for its superior bulk and better coverage on its primary STAB move.</li> <li>Choice Scarf makes Tapu Lele lose the ability to check foes like Chansey, Blissey ,and Lugia, so checks to those kinds of threats should be run as well.</li> <li>This set's ability to revenge kill powerful priority users lets it support its team by removing foes such as Marshadow and even boosted Mega Lucario provided Tapu Lele doesn't get KOed coming in, something even Choice Scarf Xerneas has trouble with.</li> </ul> "

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Mega Venusaur's defensive typing, bulk, and Thick Fat ability give balance teams a Toxic immunity and a sturdy blanket check to many common threats in the metagame such as Xerneas, Life Orb Marshadow, physical Primal Kyogre, support Arceus formes, Chansey, Lugia, support Primal Groudon, and Arceus-Fairy.</li> <li>With Leech Seed, Mega Venusaur is able to wear down most of its switch-ins and potentially provide its team with a solid amount of recovery in a tier where a plethora of Pokemon have high HP stats.</li> <li>Mega Venusaur's main form of reliable recovery, Synthesis, does have drawbacks. While it provides more recovery under Primal Groudon's Desolate Land, against Primal Kyogre, a Pokemon Mega Venusaur is supposed to check, it recovers less. Synthesis also only has 8 PP, which can be detrimental if Mega Venusaur has been pressured by powerful attacks and entry hazards throughout the match.</li> <li>Mega Venusaur is notably passive, which can render it setup fodder against a plethora of setup sweepers such as Necrozma-DM, Swords Dance Arceus formes, Dragon Dance Zygarde-C if lacking Grass Knot, Arceus-Flying, and Arceus-Dark. Mega Venusaur's passivity also leaves it vulnerable to being trapped and taken out by Mega Gengar and Gothitelle.</li> <li>A vast majority of common offensive threats in the metagame, including Ultra Necrozma, offensive Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, Yveltal, Mega Lucario, Deoxys-A, Mewtwo, Mega Salamence, Rayquaza, and Calm Mind Primal Kyogre, also overwhelm Mega Venusaur.</li> <li>Mega Venusaur is shut down by Taunt, which prevents it from using Leech Seed and its other support moves.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Knock Off allows Mega Venusaur to remove items held by its common switch-ins such as Ho-Oh, Yveltal, Magearna, Ferrothorn, and support Necrozma-DM. However, it's difficult to fit onto Mega Venusaur's moveset and it's useless against Pokemon that hold items that are unable to be removed, including Z-Crystals, Mega Stones, Giratina-O's Griseous Orb, Primal Groudon's Red Orb, Primal Kyogre's Blue Orb, and Arceus's Plates.</li> <li>Power Whip can be used as a STAB move over Grass Knot to have a much better matchup against Calm Mind variants of Primal Kyogre while dishing out much more damage against Marshadow, Blissey, and Chansey. However, it has half the PP of Grass Knot, has a chance to miss, and doesn't hit Primal Groudon nearly as hard.</li> <li>Hidden Power Fire helps Mega Venusaur's matchup against Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, but it hits nothing else. Knock Off variants of Mega Venusaur are still able to go one-on-one with Ferrothorn anyway.</li> <li>Sleep Powder can cripple Mega Venusaur's switch-ins and provide its teammates with free turns, but it's better to use Toxic and put its checks on a timer.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Ferrothorn, Necrozma-DM, Magearna, and Mega Scizor all comfortably switch into Mega Venusaur thanks to their Toxic immunity, while Swords Dance Mega Lucario offensively overwhelms variants lacking Earthquake. Ferrothorn is immune to Leech Seed and takes advantage of Mega Venusaur by freely setting up Spikes, while offensive Necrozma-DM and Swords Dance Mega Scizor render it setup fodder. However, Magearna needs to watch out for Earthquake, and Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor must be wary of the rare Hidden Power Fire. Ferrothorn also has to worry about coming in on a potential Knock Off, in which case Mega Venusaur is able to go one-on-one with it.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar and Gothitelle: Mega Gengar is capable of trapping and removing Mega Venusaur sets that don't run Earthquake. Even when Earthquake is being used, Mega Gengar can still use Will-O-Wisp and Hex to win the one-on-one matchup against it. Mega Gengar can also use Taunt to prevent Mega Venusaur from healing itself or using Roar to escape Shadow Tag. Meanwhile, Gothitelle takes no little damage from any of Mega Venusaur's attacks and can proceed to PP stall it until it faints.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Ho-Oh, Yveltal, Arceus-Flying, Mega Salamence, Rayquaza, and Shaymin-S pressure Mega Venusaur with their high-powered STAB moves. While Mega Salamence can take advantage of an incoming Toxic to power up Facade and Arceus-Flying can get rid of status conditions with Refresh, the other Flying-types don't appreciate being badly poisoned on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Deoxys-A, Mewtwo, Tapu Lele, Lunala, and Necrozma formes force Mega Venusaur out with their super effective Psychic-type attacks. However, none of these threats appreciate taking a Toxic on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure: Setup sweepers such as Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, Calm Mind Primal Kyogre when Mega Venusaur lacks Power Whip, Swords Dance Arceus formes such as Arceus-Ground, Arceus, and Arceus-Ghost, Calm Mind Arceus-Dark, and Naganadel overload Mega Venusaur thanks to all of them being able to survive any one hit and retaliate with boosted attacks. Another form of offensive pressure includes forcing Mega Venusaur to expend its limited Synthesis PP, which can be done by stacking entry hazards and repeatedly using powerful attacks such as Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades and Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike. Mega Venusaur can also be denied HP recovery from the use of Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Kyurem-W: Thanks to Turboblaze, Kyurem-W is able to bypass Mega Venusaur's Thick Fat ability and hit it super effectively with Ice Beam.</p> ",

The combination of Toxic and Leech Seed applies pressure by dishing out a sizable amount of residual damage.</li> <li>Roar is another option that can be used over Toxic that allows Mega Venusaur to phaze setup sweepers such as Xerneas and Calm Mind Arceus formes and punish Substitute users.</li> <li>Synthesis gives Mega Venusaur a reliable recovery option to keep it healthy throughout the match. It's also worth noting that Venusaur recovers more health under Primal Groudon's Desolate Land and less health under Primal Kyogre's Primordial Sea.</li> <li>Grass Knot is a reliable STAB move that does a sizable amount of damage to heavy targets such as Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Mega Sableye, and Arceus formes.</li> <li>Earthquake is another option that gives Mega Venusaur a fighting chance against Mega Gengar, Magearna, Mega Lucario, and support Necrozma-DM.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Venusaurite is required for Venusaur to Mega Evolve and receive the Thick Fat ability, which will improve its matchup against support Arceus formes that use Ice Beam as well as support Primal Groudon that use Fire-type attacks.</li> <li>Chlorophyll is used as the base ability to revenge kill offensive Primal Groudon under Desolate Land.</li> <li>252 HP EVs provide Mega Venusaur with as much bulk as possible.</li> <li>76 Special Defense EVs prevent Mega Gengar's Sludge Wave from 2HKOing Mega Venusaur, as well as preventing Xerneas's +2 Moonblast from 2HKOing after Leech Seed recovery.</li> <li>The rest of the EVs go into Defense along with a Bold nature to help Mega Venusaur take on strong physical attackers such as support Primal Groudon, physical Primal Kyogre, and Life Orb Marshadow. Run an Impish nature if Earthquake is being used over Grass Knot to have a better chance at 3HKOing Magearna.</li> <li>An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 88 Def / 168 SpD with a Calm or Careful nature allows Mega Venusaur to take on special attackers better, such as preventing the 2HKO from +2 Xerneas's Moonblast after Stealth Rock and Leech Seed recovery as well as lowering the chance of being 2HKOed by Primal Kyogre's +1 Origin Pulse after Leech Seed recovery. However, support Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades now 2HKOes Mega Venusaur after Stealth Rock, and Life Orb Marshadow's Spectral Thief has a small chance to 2HKO after Stealth Rock as well.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Try to Mega Evolve with Venusaur as soon as possible, as Mega Venusaur's Thick Fat is vital in helping it switch into support Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and support Arceus formes that use Ice Beam.</li> <li>Frequently use Leech Seed to punish Mega Venusaur's checks as they come in. Residual damage quickly racks up on an opposing threat, especially against Pokemon that lack reliable recovery. Leech Seed is also key to keeping Mega Venusaur healthy during one-on-one matchups against Pokemon it's supposed to check, and it can be used to heal its teammates once Mega Venusaur switches out.</li> <li>Try to use Synthesis sparingly, as it only has 8 PP, and once Mega Venusaur runs out of it, Leech Seed won't provide enough recovery to help it withstand most of its checks. Keep in mind that the amount of HP Synthesis recovers is determined by the weather. Under Primal Groudon's Desolate Land, Synthesis recovers two-thirds of Mega Venusaur's health, but under Primal Kyogre's Primordial Sea and Tyranitar's Sand Stream, it only provides one-fourth of HP recovery.</li> <li>An opposing Primal Kyogre's set must be scouted for, as Calm Mind variants are able to 2HKO Mega Venusaur with +1 Origin Pulse and Grass Knot fails to 2HKO after a Calm Mind boost. However, defensive and physical sets of Primal Kyogre are easily withstood.</li> <li>Mega Venusaur is able to take on some of stall's staple Pokemon fairly well. Physically defensive Mega Sableye is 3HKOed by Grass Knot, and its Recover PP can be stalled out, since Grass Knot has double the amount. Meanwhile, both Blissey and Chansey are unable to touch Mega Venusaur and taken advantage of by Leech Seed, which can recover a ton of health for its teammates.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Ground-type Pokemon such as Arceus-Ground and Zygarde-C make for excellent partners, as they apply pressure to opposing Steel-types and other offensive threats that threaten Mega Venusaur such as Necrozma-DM, Mega Lucario, Mega Salamence, Rayquaza, offensive Primal Groudon, and Mega Gengar. Arceus-Ground can also remove entry hazards with Defog, which is important for the balance teams that Mega Venusaur fits onto. In return, Mega Venusaur checks Arceus-Water, Primal Kyogre, and Lugia.</li> <li>Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon are also good countermeasures for Steel-types, most notably Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, which are two Pokemon that Mega Venusaur particularly struggles with. Ho-Oh is also able to switch into Yveltal, while Primal Groudon acts as a second check to Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>Dark-types such as Yveltal and Arceus-Dark are phenomenal allies that are immune to Psychic-type attacks and are great checks to Necrozma formes, Mega Gengar, Lunala, Mewtwo, and Deoxys-A . Yveltal's defensive Charti Berry set is also able to check Swords Dance variants of Necrozma-DM, Primal Groudon, and Arceus. Meanwhile, Mega Venusaur checks Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy.</li> <li>On the flip side, offensive Yveltal and Calm Mind + Refresh Arceus-Dark heavily pressure Mega Venusaur, so Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy make for good partners that can withstand their STAB moves fairly easily. Choice Scarf Xerneas can outspeed and knock out Bulk Up Marshadow and Ultra Necrozma, and bulkier sets can act as clerics with Aromatherapy. Meanwhile, Arceus-Fairy appreciates Mega Venusaur luring in Yveltal and Arceus-Dark to find opportunities to set up Calm Mind.</li> <li>Water-types such as Primal Kyogre and Arceus-Water are great teammates for Mega Venusaur. Primal Kyogre is able to force Ho-Oh, Zygarde-C, and offensive Primal Groudon sets out, while Arceus-Water switches into Mega Salamence and Rayquaza while also being able to check Ho-Oh and clear the field of entry hazards with Defog. Primal Kyogre, in particular, highly appreciates Knock Off variants of Mega Venusaur as it can remove Ferrothorn's Leftovers while being immune to opposing Leech Seed, making it easier to wear down for Primal Kyogre later in the match.</li> <li>Rock-types such as Tyranitar and Arceus-Rock make for amazing partners to Mega Venusaur, since they're able to reliably switch into the many common Flying-types in the tier. Arceus-Rock has the option to run Fire Blast to slam checks that it shares with Mega Venusaur such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Mega Lucario, while Tyranitar can set up Stealth Rock and trap Mega Gengar with Pursuit. However, be aware that Tyranitar's Sand Stream nerfs Synthesis's HP recovery. In return, Mega Venusaur answers support Primal Groudon, Life Orb Marshadow, Arceus-Water, support Arceus-Ground, and most Primal Kyogre sets.</li> </ul> "

If using a Jolly nature, Dugtrio can outspeed Mega Diancie and Mega Lucario and trap both while Speed tying with Arceus formes, letting Dugtrio get some damage or use Toxic on them as a last-ditch effort, but the power difference is notable against other targets.</li> <li>Arena Trap is the only ability that makes Dugtrio useful, letting it trap and at least cripple some threats in the tier.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Dugtrio has the ability to discourage Primal Groudon and Magearna from switching in and using Stealth Rock or Volt Switch, respectively. Use this information to pressure the opposing team by preventing Primal Groudon from setting Stealth Rock or baiting Primal Groudon or Magearna to come in by bringing out a Pokemon weak to them, such as Xerneas.</li> <li>Never bring Dugtrio into an attack. Due to its terrible bulk, it will fall to almost any neutral hit and will not complete its job.</li> <li>After trapping and removing the desired target, Dugtrio can be sacrificed to gain some momentum.</li> <li>While Dugtrio is fast, it will fail to cripple slower Pokemon with priority moves, such as Extreme Killer Arceus and boosted Adamant Mega Lucario. Do not try to trap these threats, as Dugtrio will be KOed for no reason.</li> <li>Dugtrio can be used to force Necrozma-DM to transform into Ultra Necrozma when trying to trap it, leaving it unable to check Geomancy Xerneas. Be wary, though, that if Necrozma-DM transforms, Dugtrio will be KOed before it can do anything.</li> <li>Toxapex and Blissey usually run Shed Shell, allowing them to avoid being trapped and keep momentum by switching out. Do not try to trap them without removing their items beforehand, or at least scout for Black Sludge, Rocky Helmet, or Leftovers.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Pokemon that appreciate Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM being removed, such as Xerneas, make good partners.</li> <li>Setup sweepers, such as offensive Geomancy Xerneas and Mega Salamence, can use the foe afflicted by Dugtrio's Memento as setup fodder.</li> <li>Dugtrio traps and removes Magearna, letting Yveltal use its STAB moves with less caution.</li> <li>Similarly, Primal Kyogre and its regular forme appreciates Dugtrio's ability to trap and remove Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Slow pivots pair well with Dugtrio, bringing it in safely. Mega Scizor is a good example, since it baits in Necrozma-DM and Primal Groudon, allowing Dugtrio to trap them.</li> <li>Paralysis support can be useful in a scenario where trapping an Arceus forme is desired, allowing Dugtrio to set up a Substitute on it and at least cripple it with Screech + Earthquake. Glare Zygarde-C can fulfill this role, since it baits support Arceus formes fairly well.</li> </ul> "

  "Muk-Alola": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Alolan Muk is an exclusive Dark-type that can function as a reliable and capable answer to Ghost-types in the tier, save for Marshadow and the rare Swords Dance Arceus-Ghost. Prominent Ghost-types like Mega Gengar and Lunala have the option to circumvent their checks with high Speed, high damage output, and coverage moves, and Alolan Muk differentiates itself from more common Dark-types like Yveltal and Arceus-Dark with its neutrality to Fighting and access to Pursuit.</li> <li>While this may seem like an eclipsed role when considering Tyranitar's existence in the tier, its extreme weakness to Fighting makes it a shakier answer to Ghost-types. Alolan Muk can almost always pivot in and weaken or KO special Ghost-types and Mega Mewtwo Y with Pursuit under reasonable conditions. The ability to trap and remove Mega Gengar and Deoxys-A is also helpful to balanced and defensive teams alike.</li> <li>Alolan Muk can also support its team with its ability to remove Toxic Spikes on the switch and justify Knock Off to hinder its switch-ins. Additionally, unlike other bulky Pokemon on balanced and defensive teams, Alolan Muk is less reliant on prediction to punish a switch-in with status due to Poison Touch, which makes its attacks potentially hazardous to its offensive checks.</li> <li>With Assault Vest, Alolan Muk is a more secure answer to the aforementioned special attackers. However, Alolan Muk's lackluster physical bulk and low Speed make it prone to more threats than the ones it covers. Though Alolan Muk's common teammates can cover these flaws to an extent, Alolan Muk can often burden its teammates, as it tends to proactively switch into threats it checks and may allow the opponent to take advantage of predictable reactions in a few ways, such as by double switching into a common Pokemon like Primal Groudon, with relatively low risk.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>A set utilizing Lum Berry or Rest can provide the team with more security against Mega Gengar by healing Alolan Muk of a burn. This set can also justify moves like Taunt to improve the matchup against Gothitelle thanks to the lack of Assault Vest, but this allows Mega Gengar and Lunala to 2HKO Alolan Muk after a little damage from entry hazards.</li> <li>A Choice Band set can catch some foes off guard. Alolan Muk with Choice Band and maximum Attack investment can OHKO retreating Mega Gengar with Pursuit after getting burned, do serious damage to Necrozma-DM, and threaten to OHKO Blissey with Knock Off. This set suffers from reduced defensive presence, however.</li> <li>Fire Blast can surprise Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Magearna, and Celesteela, but they are already hindered by losing their Leftovers to Knock Off. Fire Blast also does minuscule damage to Necrozma-DM and only proves to be effective at punishing Mega Lucario and Skarmory, both of which need prior damage to be 2HKOed. Fire Punch can be used to hit Necrozma-DM and Magearna harder, but it has similar problems as Fire Blast.</li> <li>Ice Punch can break Zygarde-C's Substitute and prevent Facade Mega Salamence from liberally switching into Alolan Muk, but Mega Salamence can only be 2HKOed on the switch.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: While Primal Groudon, Zygarde, and Arceus-Ground are all threatening to Alolan Muk as offensive checks that can OHKO it, Zygarde and Arceus-Ground can cause further problems, as they can set up on Alolan Muk behind Substitute. Note that Alolan Muk can still make a last-ditch effort to poison them with Shadow Sneak in some instances, and Primal Groudon typically has to manage its health for more important foes, such as Defog users, if running offensive Stealth Rock sets.</p> <p><strong>Mega Salamence: Mega Salamence takes little damage from Alolan Muk with its high physical bulk and Intimidate prior to Mega Evolution, heals damage with Roost, and easily overpowers Alolan Muk with its attacks. Mega Salamence can also switch into Alolan Muk and use boosted Facade if Poison Touch activates.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers</strong>: Alolan Muk's low physical bulk leaves it susceptible to strong physical attackers like physical variants of Primal Kyogre, Marshadow, and Extreme Killer Arceus.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Most defensive Steel-types dislike losing Leftovers to Knock Off, but Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Klefki can set up layers of Spikes on Alolan Muk, which wear it down very rapidly. Necrozma-DM can pose similar issues if it has defensive investment, Solganium Z, and Morning Sun.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Alolan Muk's effectiveness as a counter to Ghost-types and a blanket check to Yveltal and Arceus-Dark largely depends on its health. This means entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes are detrimental to its role. Burn also causes residual damage that Alolan Muk dislikes, but more importantly, it prevents Alolan Muk from effectively trapping Ghost-types.</p> ",

        "name": "Assault Vest",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Alolan Muk naturally avoids a 2HKO from Mega Gengar, Lunala, and Mega Mewtwo Y when healthy enough, and it can even take multiple attacks when equipped with an Assault Vest. This makes Alolan Muk an effective Pursuit trapper that can guarantee said threats' removal.</li> <li>Though many Pokemon in Ubers hold irremovable items, Knock Off can punish a large number of switch-ins like Ferrothorn and Magearna that dislike losing their item. Knock Off is generally the most spammable move when Alolan Muk isn't attempting to Pursuit trap something, as foes with irremovable items that want to switch into it risk getting poisoned due to Poison Touch.</li> <li>Shadow Sneak gives Alolan Muk some usefulness against offensive teams by letting it pick off weakened Marshadow and Ultra Necrozma. More importantly, this move significantly improves Alolan Muk's matchup against Deoxys-A, as the latter is forced to predict between attacking Alolan Muk first on a predicted Pursuit or switching out on Alolan Muk's Shadow Sneak, which OHKOes it before it can move.</li> <li>Clear Smog is quite weak due to Alolan Muk's low Special Attack and lack of investment, but it is a crucial tool for Alolan Muk to weaken boosted Geomancy Xerneas and Calm Mind Arceus formes in a pinch. When Alolan Muk is no longer needed, this move also comes in handy against Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground by preventing them from setting up.</li> <li>Poison Jab enables Alolan Muk to defeat Life Orb Yveltal in a one-on-one situation, 2HKO Xerneas, and OHKO the rarer Tapu Lele. Combined with Poison Touch, Poison Jab also has a good chance to poison the foe.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum HP investment increases Alolan Muk's mixed bulk, and combined with 28 Defense EVs, Alolan Muk can avoid a 2HKO from Life Orb Deoxys-A from full HP.</li> <li>80 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature give Alolan Muk enough power to OHKO Mega Gengar on its switch with Pursuit. The rest of the EVs are invested into Special Defense to make Alolan Muk more challenging for Lunala and other special attackers to take down.</li> <li>Maximum Attack EVs can be considered to 2HKO Lunala with Shadow Shield intact with Pursuit. A stronger Pursuit also has better odds to 2HKO Mega Mewtwo Y.</li> <li>Poison Touch gives Alolan Muk's contact moves a 30% chance to poison the target, which makes it hazardous for Alolan Muk's checks like Primal Groudon to directly switch in.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Alolan Muk boasts high special bulk with the given investment and Assault Vest. Pokemon like Arceus-Dark, Mega Gengar, and Lunala will struggle to take down healthy Alolan Muk with a few hits, and the latter two can be easily weakened or removed once Alolan Muk has switched in safely.</li> <li>Complete lack of recovery means Alolan Muk will inevitably be worn down as it continues to pivot into attacks. Unless the team has Wish support, Alolan Muk's health management will be important, so avoid switching into neutral attacks from Pokemon like Arceus-Water and taking damage from entry hazards. Especially if Alolan Muk has other important tasks to fulfill, such as trapping Deoxys-A, combating and weakening Yveltal for teammates, and remaining as an emergency stop to Geomancy Xerneas, it won't be able to keep itself healthy for multiple foes. This means even switching into Toxic users can be a risky move unless it is pivoting into an extremely passive foe like Blissey.</li> <li>However, opponents will often try to bait in Alolan Muk, and most teams will have at least two Pokemon that can take advantage of its tendency to reactively switch in. Alolan Muk especially suffers from the wide range of Pokemon that can threaten it in a one-on-one situation, and it is punished even more harshly if it runs into a check or counter after taking entry hazard damage.</li> <li>Be mindful about the significance of Alolan Muk and Pokemon it has to check. Teams that will be reliant on Mega Gengar or Lunala to gain an upper hand against slower teams that Alolan Muk commonly fits on will try to preserve them until it is weakened throughout the game or they have benefited a lot from baiting in Alolan Muk, double switching, and reversing momentum.</li> <li>Alolan Muk can exercise less caution against slower teams and defensive teams where there will be fewer offensive checks and more Pokemon like Blissey that also tend to reactively switch into their checks. These teams also tend to lack a Pokemon that Alolan Muk has to remain healthy to handle, so fully take advantage of Knock Off's item removal and Poison Touch in this matchup.</li> <li>Do not overlook Shadow Sneak's usefulness. In an emergency, Shadow Sneak can do minor damage and poison a foe at the same time, so Alolan Muk will have two chances to poison a foe setting up on it before going down. Shadow Sneak can also pick off weakened Psychic- and Ghost-types, preventing the likes of Ultra Necrozma and Marshadow from damaging a revenge killer before going down.</li> <li>While Alolan Muk's matchup against Mega Gengar is generally advantageous, some Mega Gengar variants with Will-O-Wisp can circumvent this. Substitute variants can also escape from Alolan Muk, as Substitute will take damage for Mega Gengar as it switches out. This means being overly reliant on Alolan Muk to compensate for the team's vulnerability to Mega Gengar isn't advised. Alolan Muk also struggles to effectively trap Gothitelle, as it is slower than Gothitelle, so it will be neutralized by Charm before it can KO back.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Balanced and defensive teams can employ Alolan Muk to provide themselves with security against Ghost-types. Teammates like Arceus-Fairy, Lugia, and Mega Slowbro, which are vulnerable to Mega Gengar, benefit from Mega Gengar's absence and Alolan Muk making Lunala hesitate before taking advantage of them. These Pokemon may also struggle to properly deal with Toxapex, and Alolan Muk can absorb Toxic Spikes on the switch when given a chance. In return, Lugia and Mega Slowbro are capable of checking Primal Groudon, which may set up as Alolan Muk is forced out. Arceus-Fairy can check threats like Yveltal and Marshadow and prevent Calm Mind Arceus-Dark from fully setting up on Alolan Muk lacking Clear Smog.</li> <li>Entry hazard support will come in handy, as Facade Mega Salamence will struggle to take advantage of status induced by Alolan Muk and keep itself healthy at the same time with Stealth Rock on the field. Defensive Ho-Oh can be also a nuisance to this set, and Stealth Rock can be helpful for this reason as well. Primal Groudon and Arceus-Fairy can be appropriate choices for Stealth Rock setters. Primal Groudon can take advantage of Steel-types that try to wall Alolan Muk, and with Alolan Muk potentially poisoning support Arceus formes, it can 2HKO them even when lacking offensive investment. Arceus-Fairy's ability to threaten Giratina-O and Mega Sableye while setting Stealth Rock will come in handy to pressure certain balance and defensive teams. In return, Alolan Muk can remove Leftovers from Magearna to make it easier for Arceus-Fairy to wear down.</li> <li>Defensive teams can use Chansey or Blissey to better check support Arceus formes and Xerneas. Chansey especially appreciates Alolan Muk's ability to remove Leftovers from Steel-types and Pursuit trap Mega Gengar, and it can keep Alolan Muk healthy with Wish support.</li> <li>Entry hazard removers are needed to prevent Alolan Muk from getting worn down by entry hazards. As a single switch when Stealth Rock is on the field can lower the chance that Alolan Muk checks Deoxys-A and Geomancy Xerneas in a pinch, entry hazard removers like Ho-Oh, Giratina-O, and support Arceus formes are important partners. These Pokemon are also effective pivots to Primal Groudon. Choice Scarf Xerneas is also a considerable option, as it must be wary of Mega Gengar and can take down Ultra Necrozma, which Alolan Muk needs too much prior damage to reliably take down with Shadow Sneak.</li> </ul> "

Arceus-Dark can also burn Cloyster with Will-O-Wisp, rendering it useless.</p> <p><strong>Anti-Leads: Smeargle's higher Speed allows it to use Spore before Cloyster can move and proceed to set up its own hazards. Shuckle's natural bulk means that it can take two Icicle Spears, can Encore Cloyster into a move, and get its own hazards up. Mega Sableye does not care about Cloyster, as it can bounce back the hazards, take a boosted Icicle Spear, and burn Cloyster with Will-O-Wisp. It can also use Foul Play if Cloyster decides to set up on it. Both Choice Band Tyranitar and Dragon Dance Mega Tyranitar can OHKO Cloyster with the combination of Stone Edge and Sand Stream. Even though Mega Kangaskhan is very rare, it deserves a mention, as it can stop Cloyster from doing anything with the combination of Fake Out and Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Cloyster has terrible special bulk and gets 2HKOed by basically any neutral special move.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Pokemon such as defensive Primal Kyogre and Toxapex take minimal damage even from a boosted Icicle Spear and can beat Cloyster.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel types such as Necrozma-DM, Mega Lucario, and Magearna resist Icicle Spear and can proceed to set up on Cloyster or beat it.</p> ",

With a Jolly nature, +2 Cloyster outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame and notable Pokemon like +1 Adamant Mega Salamence, Deoxys-S, +2 standard Geomancy Xerneas, Choice Scarf Xerneas, and +2 standard Rock Polish Primal Groudon.</li> <li>An Adamant nature can also be used, as Cloyster will have a high chance to OHKO standard Giratina and Necrozma-DW with +2 Icicle Spear, preventing the latter from blocking Rapid Spin.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Since Cloyster is a dedicated lead, getting up entry hazards should be the main priority.</li> <li>Try to preserve Focus Sash, as it can come in clutch later.</li> <li>Use Shell Smash and Icicle Spear to pressure opposing hazard setters to prevent them from getting hazards up, to do as much damage as possible before going down, and to punish a predicted use of Defog or switch to a bulkier Pokemon.</li> <li>Although weakening the opponent's team is great, spinning away hazards is more important.</li> <li>Lead against Pokemon such as Deoxys-S and Excadrill, since Cloyster can beat them with Icicle Spear and spin their hazards away.</li> <li>Avoid leading with Cloyster versus bad matchups such as against Mega Sableye, Smeargle, and support Arceus formes, especially Arceus-Water and Arceus-Dark, as some sets use Will-O-Wisp.</li> <li>Getting only one layer of Toxic Spikes is more helpful versus offensive teams, since the games are quite fast paced and the constant 12% damage is preferred rather than the increasing damage over time with two layers, but against balance builds, two layers are better, as being badly poisoned is more threatening to defensive Pokemon.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Cloyster is a dedicated entry hazard lead; hence, it only fits on hyper offensive builds.</li> <li>Taunt users such as Mega Gengar, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Yveltal make excellent teammates for Cloyster, as they prevent the hazards from getting removed. They also help against Smeargle, although they can be crippled by Nuzzle.</li> <li>Spinblockers such as Marshadow, Mega Gengar, Lunala, and Arceus-Ghost make great teammates for a similar reason. Lunala especially appreciates Cloyster's Rapid Spin support because of its Shadow Shield. Mega Gengar appreciates Toxic Spikes, since it can then run Hex more effectively.</li> <li>Stealth Rock users such as Arceus-Fairy and Primal Groudon are helpful to Cloyster. Primal Groudon is especially useful, as it can pressure Pokemon Cloyster has trouble with such as support Arceus formes and Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy make decent teammates, as they can anti-lead against Mega Sableye and pressure Defoggers like Mega Salamence and Giratina. Arceus-Fairy is a great partner because it can also get Stealth Rock up. Xerneas appreciates the Spikes support, as it helps wear Pokemon like Necrozma-DM and Primal Groudon down.</li> <li>Pokemon weak to hazards such as Mega Salamence, Yveltal, and Rayquaza appreciate Cloyster removing hazards for them.</li> <li>Since Cloyster is decent at getting hazards up, strong wallbreakers and late-game cleaners such as Rock Polish Primal Groudon, Dragon Dance Mega Salamence, Double Dance Necrozma-DM, Dragon Dance Zygarde, Geomancy Xerneas, Marshadow, and Calm Mind Arceus-Flying are used alongside it, as they all appreciate their checks getting worn down.</li> </ul> "

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Great Special Attack, a high Speed tier, and most importantly, a near-exclusive ability in Shadow Tag leave Mega Gengar as one of the most dreaded threats in the tier that can selectively eliminate foes it desires to trap.</li> <li>A wide movepool and access to many utility moves such as Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, and Destiny Bond allow Mega Gengar to threaten a variety of foes and fulfill many roles by providing excellent utility options.</li> <li>Mega Gengar's unique typing provides it with a number of perks over other offensive threats. A Ghost typing lets Mega Gengar block Rapid Spin and, in tandem with its high Speed tier, check Extreme Killer Arceus. A Poison typing lets Mega Gengar easily switch into passive walls that rely on Toxic and remove Toxic Spikes.</li> <li>While Mega Gengar can synergize with many Pokemon in the tier thanks to its aforementioned traits, it should be used with caution, as Gengar's pitiful bulk means it folds to any strong attacks and therefore a single misprediction will usually lead to its KO. This tends to limit Mega Gengar's ability to effectively trap foes and safely undergo Mega Evolution to gain Shadow Tag without relying on Substitute.</li> <li>Defensive teams are well aware of Mega Gengar's presence in the tier and employ dedicated Pursuit trappers or equip their Pokemon with Shed Shell, and these strategies can limit Mega Gengar's effectiveness to a degree.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Disable can be used in tandem with Substitute to shut down a foe that has a Choice item or has only one way to damage Mega Gengar.</li> <li>A set using Perish Song can be used to eliminate passive foes, but this set has to dedicate at least three moves, namely Perish Song, Substitute, and Disable or Protect, to effectively stall out three turns. Running this set significantly hampers Mega Gengar's offensive presence, leaving it matchup dependent and somewhat unreliable to use.</li> <li>Protect guarantees Gengar's safe Mega Evolution, but this can potentially give an opponent a free turn to set up or even switch into a Pursuit trapper.</li> <li>Reflect Type prevents Tyranitar from Pursuit trapping Mega Gengar and allows it to have the upper hand against Arceus-Dark and Steel-types like Ferrothorn, but it is generally not worth forgoing a utility move.</li> <li>Sucker Punch allows Mega Gengar to eliminate Deoxys-A, but it has little use outside of this.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Mega Gengar can choose its matchups and prevent its foe from switching out thanks to Shadow Tag. Some checks and counters can be bypassed with different movesets and can be traded with due to Destiny Bond. Thus, it is quite difficult to conventionally counter Mega Gengar in an effective way.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Offensive Foes</strong>: Mega Gengar is reliant on KOing its foes due to its extreme frailty, and this leads to its unfavorable matchup against bulky foes such as Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Ho-Oh, and Arceus-Ground, all of which tend to switch into Gengar before it gains Shadow Tag. Mega Gengar can't KO these foes without relying on prior damage, status ailments, or Destiny Bond, while they can easily OHKO Mega Gengar in return.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Trapping: Tyranitar easily walls any Mega Gengar lacking Focus Blast and can guarantee its removal with Pursuit trapping, though this may be unsuccessful if Mega Gengar is behind a Substitute as it switches out or if Tyranitar lacks Lum Berry and is burnt on the switch by Will-O-Wisp. Marshadow and Deoxys-A can also Pursuit trap Mega Gengar on a forced switch, but this involves a risk.</p> <p><strong>Faster Foes: Mega Gengar's frailty leaves it susceptible to faster foes like Mega Mewtwo Y and Deoxys-A. Choice Scarf users like Yveltal and Rayquaza can easily revenge kill Mega Gengar.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves: While Mega Gengar is immune to Extreme Speed, Sucker Punch from Yveltal and Shadow Sneak from Marshadow and Giratina-O can bypass Mega Gengar's high Speed and pick it off or OHKO it in many instances.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>STAB Shadow Ball hits Ghost- and Psychic-types super effectively and hits a good portion of the tier for at least neutral damage.</li> <li>Sludge Wave is a stronger STAB move that lets Mega Gengar reliably remove Fairy-types.</li> <li>Icy Wind OHKOes offensive Mega Salamence and Rayquaza and KOes untransformed Zygarde after it has switched into any other attack after Stealth Rock damage. The utility from the drop in Speed is also handy against the aforementioned foes, should they attempt setting up on Mega Gengar. Hidden Power Ice can be considered due to its higher damage output against Mega Salamence and untransformed Zygarde, however.</li> <li>Focus Blast rounds off Mega Gengar's already good STAB coverage by hitting Dark-types like Tyranitar and Arceus-Dark super effectively. It also scores 2HKOs on Extreme Killer Arceus and Dialga, which none of Mega Gengar's other attacks can accomplish.</li> <li>Thunder lets Mega Gengar 2HKO Pokemon it otherwise cannot, such as Primal Kyogre, Ho-Oh, and Arceus-Water. It also has a chance to OHKO Naive Yveltal. Its unreliable accuracy can be detrimental, however.</li> <li>Taunt prevents the use of non-attacking moves, letting Mega Gengar effectively take down passive foes and avoid becoming fodder against a foe it cannot defeat.</li> <li>Substitute, especially with this set, is effective at punishing forced switches on the turn Gengar Mega Evolves, as it buys Mega Gengar a turn to freely attack a foe with an appropriate move. Substitute is also handy for preventing Mega Gengar from getting revenge killed, letting it take advantage of passive foes that cannot break its Substitute, and avoiding Pursuit trappers on the turn it Mega Evolves.</li> <li>Any combination of moves from the third and fourth slots can be considered based on the needs of the team at large.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>An EV spread that maximizes Special Attack and Speed lets Mega Gengar effectively fulfill its role as an offensive threat while outspeeding any Pokemon with base Speed lower than 130.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Unlike other sets, this set aims to maximize Mega Gengar's coverage and thus the number of foes Mega Gengar can trap and remove.</li> <li>Before Gengar has Mega Evolved and gained Shadow Tag, predict what foe will switch into it so it can effectively hit them with appropriate moves or switch out if they're a Pursuit trapper. Safely gaining a chance to attack foes becomes easier when Mega Gengar has Substitute, so use it to ease predictions.</li> <li>After Gengar has successfully Mega Evolved, it will compress roles as a stallbreaker, offensive threat, and revenge killer. Unlike sets with Will-O-Wisp or Destiny Bond, this set by no means benefits from staying in against foes that it cannot beat, so keep Mega Gengar in pristine condition, especially if there are threats like Ultra Necrozma and Extreme Killer Arceus that Mega Gengar can effectively deal with.</li> <li>As Mega Gengar relies on KOing foes with its great coverage rather than brute force, it is ideal to use Mega Gengar as a revenge killer in most cases. It is usually best for Mega Gengar to switch into a foe that has an unfavorable matchup or is weakened enough to be picked off. Entry hazards and offensive pressure can be useful strategies in this regard.</li> <li>Substitute can be used to stall out residual damage against a foe afflicted with status that Mega Gengar can otherwise not KO.</li> <li>Unless absolutely needed or Mega Gengar is behind a Substitute, refrain from heavily relying on Focus Blast and Thunder to combat a foe, as they are somewhat unreliable and missing them will likely result in Mega Gengar's KO.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>This set is best fit into offensive teams that desire to employ a Pokemon that can compress the roles of a revenge killer, stallbreaker, and trapper. Offensive teams are typically capable of netting sufficient prior damage on foes for Mega Gengar to pick them off later and appreciate Mega Gengar's ability to trap and guarantee the demise of dangerous foes like Ultra Necrozma and weakened Extreme Killer Arceus.</li> <li>In order for Mega Gengar to trap and take down as many foes as possible, it will have to remain safe, which means it should be brought to the field safely. Pivoting from the likes of Choice Scarf Yveltal and Magearna can provide more opportunities for Mega Gengar to switch in reliably. The former especially draws in Fairy-types and special walls that Mega Gengar can easily dispose of.</li> <li>Xerneas is a solid check to all relevant Dark-types in the tier and has a variety of sets to support Mega Gengar. Geomancy variants appreciate the removal of special walls and can take advantage of Mega Gengar's ability to potentially weaken Steel-types with Focus Blast. Choice Scarf variants can revenge kill foes that outspeed Mega Gengar and potentially provide Defog support, which is always useful. Yveltal can also handle special walls with Taunt or Knock Off if Mega Gengar lacks a reliable way to deal with them. Both of them appreciate Mega Gengar's ability to effectively deal with Ultra Necrozma, as there will be less of a necessity for them to use Choice Scarf to deal with said threat.</li> <li>Swords Dance Arceus formes synergize well with this set. Arceus-Ground can offensively handle Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh, while Extreme Killer Arceus can take down faster foes such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Deoxys-A. Both of them can take advantage of Mega Gengar's ability to run Icy Wind and dispose of Zygarde, which would otherwise be an infuriating foe to deal with.</li> <li>Primal Groudon can provide Stealth Rock support, pivot into Ho-Oh and Primal Kyogre, and run offensive sets to take down Mega Gengar's checks. Defensive variants of Primal Groudon especially value Mega Gengar to dispose of Zygarde with Icy Wind as well.</li> <li>Primal Kyogre can pressure Mega Gengar's checks like Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and various Arceus formes. Both physical and special variants are capable of fitting alongside Mega Gengar to take down each others' checks.</li> <li>Ho-Oh and Rayquaza appreciate Mega Gengar luring Tyranitar, a common switch-in on defensive teams, and eliminating it with Focus Blast. Ho-Oh provides a valuable defensive presence for Mega Gengar against various foes, while Rayquaza can take advantage of the removal of Fairy-types and proceed to clean up late-game once Mega Gengar has weakened its checks.</li> </ul> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Hex does massive damage to foes with a status ailment, capable of 2HKOing statused Arceus formes and Magearna. However, bear in mind that unboosted Hex cannot outright OHKO Ultra Necrozma.</li> <li>Will-O-Wisp cripples various physical attackers, such as Necrozma-DM, Arceus, and Pursuit trappers. It also hinders certain defensive Pokemon like Toxapex and Ferrothorn and works well with Hex, which will do doubled damage to burnt foes.</li> <li>Mega Gengar can forgo Will-O-Wisp for another move like Focus Blast or Destiny Bond on teams that have numerous ways to status foes, but bear in mind that this worsens Mega Gengar's matchup against Necrozma-DM and other foes it can otherwise better handle with Will-O-Wisp.</li> <li>Sludge Bomb is a STAB move that has a relatively high chance to poison a foe, letting Mega Gengar potentially punish switch-ins like Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and support Arceus formes.</li> <li>Sludge Wave is a STAB move that isn't as reliant on status and allows Mega Gengar to trap and dispose of Fairy-types, namely Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy. Its better chance to OHKO Xerneas with Stealth Rock damage makes Sludge Wave the generally preferred option.</li> <li>Substitute lets Mega Gengar Mega Evolve safely early-game, avoid status moves, take advantage of forced switches and evade Pursuit trappers on Mega Evolution, punish passive foes, and evade Yveltal's Sucker Punch.</li> <li>Taunt shuts down passive foes like Chansey, Toxapex, and certain support Arceus formes, preventing them from recovering or using status moves. Thanks to Shadow Tag, Taunted passive Pokemon that carry no attacks or do not have a feasible way to damage Mega Gengar can be effectively eliminated.</li> <li>Focus Blast is an alternative option that hits Arceus-Dark and Steel-types like Dialga and Ferrothorn, which are immune or resistant to at least one of Mega Gengar's STAB moves. Focus Blast is especially valuable for OHKOing Tyranitar, as this set is helpless against Tyranitar holding a Lum Berry.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed allows Mega Gengar to hit as hard as possible while taking advantage of its great Speed tier by outspeeding all Arceus formes, Shaymin-S, and Darkrai and Speed tying with opposing Mega Gengar and Mewtwo.</li> <li>Gengarite allows Gengar to Mega Evolve, gaining Shadow Tag upon Mega Evolution.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Though it will be hard to do so, Mega Gengar should Mega Evolve as soon as possible so it can effectively utilize Shadow Tag and start pressuring foes that are vulnerable to it.</li> <li>You can bring in Mega Gengar on the field by switching it into Toxic from passive foes or predicted Normal- and Fighting-type moves from the likes of Extreme Killer Arceus and Mega Lucario, though this involves a huge risk. Safer ways include U-turn and Volt Switch from a teammate and sending Gengar in to revenge kill a foe.</li> <li>Will-O-Wisp is best used to soften physical attackers like Necrozma-DM and Extreme Killer Arceus as well as Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar. It is also handy against most foes that cannot threaten Mega Gengar in a significant way due to how powerful Hex becomes against burnt foes. Mega Gengar can also aggressively attempt to create a matchup with threatening physical attackers like Necrozma-DM to ensure that they are left crippled.</li> <li>Hex also benefits from status ailments induced by teammates, such as paralysis and poison, so try inflicting status ailments on as many foes as possible so Mega Gengar can freely use boosted Hex. Hex also powers up against sleeping Rest users like Zygarde-C and Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>Mega Gengar opting for Substitute can ease predictions, take advantage of forced switches, stall out residual damage, and safely Mega Evolve against offensive foes and teams with Pursuit trappers.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Various teammates that can inflict all non-volatile status are very helpful to this set, as they provide better conditions for Mega Gengar to utilize boosted Hex. Many Pokemon that can fulfill this role are rather passive, and they therefore appreciate Mega Gengar's ability to trap and revenge kill a statused foe and remove all relevant clerics apart from Magearna.</li> <li>Zygarde-C is one of the best teammates to Mega Gengar for various reasons. Offensive variants can check Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh, and Mega Gengar can provide a better setup condition by crippling a foe with Will-O-Wisp or Taunt. Defensive Zygarde-C can paralyze almost every relevant Pokemon in the tier with Glare, which boosts Mega Gengar's Hex and also occasionally buys free turns for it to attack or set up Substitute. In general, Mega Gengar can take advantage of Fairy-types' tendencies to switch into Zygarde-C to offensively check it.</li> <li>Ho-Oh excels at inflicting status ailments on many foes using Sacred Fire and Toxic. It checks support Arceus-Ground and Primal Groudon lacking Rock-type moves while also handling boosted Xerneas, which Mega Gengar cannot revenge kill reliably. Support Primal Groudon can effectively poison various foes with Toxic the same way as Ho-Oh due to its ability to threaten every Toxic-immune Pokemon. Its defensive strengths are generally appreciated, as Mega Gengar is unable to stop boosted Xerneas and reliably face Primal Kyogre. Primal Groudon also provides Stealth Rock support, which punishes Yveltal and Ho-Oh should they attempt taking on Mega Gengar.</li> <li>Other entry hazard setters can be used alongside Mega Gengar. Defensive Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Arceus-Fairy can draw in Defog users and set them on a timer. Spikes from Ferrothorn and Skarmory are especially appreciated, as they quickly wear down Mega Gengar's checks like Primal Groudon and Tyranitar. Mega Gengar can use Taunt to prevent Defog. Mega Gengar also benefits from Toxic Spikes from Cloyster and Toxapex poisoning foes and thus making Hex a much better of an attack.</li> <li>Various support Arceus formes, such as Arceus-Water and Arceus-Ground, can effectively handle Primal Groudon, status foes with Toxic, and take advantage of Tyranitar. They all appreciate the removal of Chansey; some of them also enjoy Mega Gengar eliminating Toxapex.</li> <li>Yveltal can fit alongside Mega Gengar as an offensive teammate thanks to its ability to safely bring in Mega Gengar with U-turn, heavily check opposing Ghost-types, and provide a Ground immunity. In return, Mega Gengar removes Fairy-types and passive special walls like Chansey, which would otherwise require Yveltal to dedicate running Taunt to surmount it.</li> <li>Xerneas also benefits from the removal of various special walls. It can take advantage of burnt foes to more reliably set up Geomancy while offensively checking Marshadow, Yveltal, and other Dark-types for Mega Gengar.</li> <li>Calm Mind Arceus formes, such as Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Fairy, appreciate the removal of their traditional checks like Toxapex and Chansey. Arceus-Dark also appreciates the removal of Fairy-types. Both of them are solid switch-ins for Dark-types, and Arceus-Fairy can check Marshadow in addition.</li> <li>Ho-Oh, Yveltal, support Arceus formes, and Giratina-O can provide Defog support, which is always helpful, especially for Mega Gengar with Substitute.</li> </ul> "

Thanks to Shadow Tag and Mega Gengar's frailty, a well-timed Destiny Bond can force a trade.</li> <li>Substitute allows Mega Gengar to safely Mega Evolve, ease predictions, and punish passive foes or foes that attempt to play around Destiny Bond.</li> <li>Sludge Wave is the strongest STAB attack that lets Mega Gengar trap and eliminate Fairy-types.</li> <li>Shadow Ball hits Psychic-types like Necrozma-DM and Mewtwo for super effective damage. Unlike unboosted Hex, Shadow Ball is capable of OHKOing Ultra Necrozma most of the time.</li> <li>Focus Blast hits Arceus-Dark, Dialga, and Ferrothorn hard while scoring OHKOs on Mega Lucario and Tyranitar, but its general coverage is inferior to Shadow Ball's.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximized Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature allow Mega Gengar to be as potent of an offensive threat as possible while outspeeding any foe that is under base 130 Speed.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>It is crucial to Mega Evolve Gengar as soon as possible in order for it to trap foes and force a trade with Destiny Bond when needed.</li> <li>As Mega Gengar needs to be KOed in order to take down its foe with Destiny Bond, draft plans early-game to decide what foes Mega Gengar has to trap and eliminate and what foe Mega Gengar will have to be traded with. This also means that Mega Gengar should not mindlessly force a trade early-game when a prominent threat that has to be dealt with by Mega Gengar is still alive.</li> <li>Mega Gengar can utilize Taunt or Destiny Bond depending on what foe it traps. Taunt can be used to shut down passive Pokemon or prevent utility moves like Defog. Bear in mind that Mega Gengar's frailty means using Taunt involves a risk against most foes, so use it with extreme caution unless prevention of opposing use of status moves outweighs the consequence of potentially sacrificing Mega Gengar.</li> <li>Destiny Bond, although it can be easily utilized due to Mega Gengar's horrid bulk, should be kept unrevealed for as long as possible, as foes that have the upper hand against Mega Gengar will not always outright proceed to OHKO Mega Gengar for various reasons. They may attempt to predict Mega Gengar switching out of a bad matchup and use status or setup moves or refrain from landing a fatal hit on Mega Gengar due to their fear of falling victim to Destiny Bond.</li> <li>Destiny Bond cannot be used consecutively; therefore, one should not mindlessly use it, as failing to make a right prediction will force out Mega Gengar and cause a loss of momentum.</li> <li>Substitute in tandem with Taunt can be effectively utilized to anti-lead the likes of Smeargle, which carries a dedicated move like Nuzzle to deal with Taunt users. Substitute also is effective against foes that intentionally do not KO Mega Gengar to avoid a potential Destiny Bond by letting Mega Gengar safely attack for two turns.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Setup sweepers appreciate Mega Gengar's ability to remove defensive roadblocks with Destiny Bond and Taunt. Geomancy Xerneas and Arceus formes using Swords Dance or Calm Mind can provide their defensive utility to protect Mega Gengar from troublesome foes like Yveltal and Marshadow while taking advantage of it removing their checks.</li> <li>Yveltal is one of the notable offensive partners for this set, as it checks Marshadow, pivots into Dark- and Ghost-type attacks, and brings Mega Gengar in safely with U-turn. It appreciates Mega Gengar's ability to lure Tyranitar and remove it with Focus Blast and to eliminate Fairy-types.</li> <li>Defensive Primal Groudon blanket checks a majority of the threats that Mega Gengar is generally forced out against, a few of them being Ho-Oh, Marshadow, and Primal Kyogre. Stealth Rock support from defensive Primal Groudon is also useful to pressure Yveltal and Ho-Oh. Setup variants can also be used alongside Mega Gengar; Rock Polish variants can remove faster threats, while Swords Dance variants can cause serious damage to defensive cores. Mega Gengar can get rid of problematic foes like Lugia, Arceus-Water, and Skarmory, which would prevent Primal Groudon from effectively dishing out damage depending on what moveset it opts for.</li> <li>Magearna can pivot into Dark-types, check boosted Xerneas, and use Volt Switch to safely let Mega Gengar switch in. Assuming Mega Gengar successfully forces a trade with Primal Groudon or Arceus-Ground, Magearna can effectively generate momentum for its team afterwards.</li> <li>Various wallbreakers, such as Primal Kyogre, Rayquaza, Palkia, and Zekrom, appreciate Mega Gengar's ability to eliminate or at least force a trade with a problematic defensive foe of its choice, as many teams often do not possess multiple checks for them. For instance, Primal Kyogre, Palkia, and Zekrom desire the removal of Primal Groudon so they can freely use their powerful STAB attacks, while Rayquaza enjoys the removal of Arceus-Fairy and physically defensive foes so it does not have to be overly reliant on prior damage or its Z-Move.</li> </ul> "

This forces Chansey's team to acquire dedicated Pursuit support to keep it safe from the former two.</li> <li>Chansey's reliance on Toxic to do meaningful damage lets threats like offensive Necrozma-DM, Mega Lucario, and Naganadel use it as a setup fodder. In addition, Mega Salamence is able to take advantage of Chansey's Toxic to fire off a boosted Facade, and Refresh Calm Mind Arceus formes are able to accumulate boosts and eventually overwhelm Chansey. Zygarde-C, Arceus, and Primal Kyogre can invest in HP to make a Substitute that cannot be broken by one Seismic Toss and set up while avoiding Toxic.</li> <li>To alleviate problems with passivity, Chansey will have to forgo one of its utility moves for Confide or Seismic Toss, meaning it will find itself being set up on when against a playstyle that it is not prepared against.</li> <li>Lastly, Chansey has trouble taking physical attacks, even with Eviolite and investment, due to its abysmal Defense, meaning common physical attackers such as Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence, and Necrozma-DM can easily threaten it. Chansey's low Defense stat is further exploited by Mewtwo's Psystrike, Deoxys-A's Superpower, and Palkia's Focus Punch.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Thunder Wave surprises Gengar, physical attackers, and Naganadel, but it has hard time fitting on Chansey's moveset.</li> <li>Counter can be used to give Chansey some offensive presence against physical attackers, but bear in mind most physical attackers that tend to switch into Chansey are usually inclined to set up prior to attacking it, and in this aspect Counter is very unreliable. Even if Chansey KOes them using Counter, it will usually be left crippled at very low health.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Trapping</strong>: Even with dedicated Pursuit support from teammates, Chansey should always be wary of trappers like Gothitelle and Dugtrio. A single well-timed double switch will immediately result in Chansey's removal, and this is devastating to Chansey's teammates due to the majority of them being physically defensive and relying on Chansey to heal their status conditions and handle special attackers. Mega Gengar, while easier to avoid trapping from due to it requiring a turn to Mega Evolve and gain Shadow Tag, is still able to remove Chansey with a combination of Taunt and a series of Sludge Waves or Focus Blasts while potentially causing Chansey to use Struggle. It can also dispose of Chansey easily with Perish Song. Although uncommon, Choice Band Tyranitar is able to either severely cripple Chansey with Pursuit or OHKO it with Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Marshadow, Mega Lucario, Mega Blaziken, and Mega Mewtwo X massively threaten Chansey with their super effective STAB moves. The former three are able to set up while forcing Chansey out, while the latter is able to use Taunt to keep Chansey from performing its role.</p> <p><strong>Strong Physical Attackers: Mega Salamence, Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, Primal Groudon, and Arceus are able to overwhelm and break through Chansey with their powerful attacks. As Chansey is forced out, these threats are able to set up or use a status move on the incoming switch-in, leaving Chansey with an obligation to switch in again to use Heal Bell while they can freely switch in again. The former three get special mentions: Mega Salamence is able to take advantage of Toxic with a boosted Facade, Ho-Oh is resilient to Toxic thanks to Regenerator, and Necrozma-DM can set up on Chansey easily thanks to its immunity to Toxic. Primal Kyogre can run physically oriented sets to score a clean 2HKO on Chansey using Liquidation.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Chansey is completely shut down by Taunt users like Mega Gengar, Yveltal, and Mewtwo. While Seismic Toss alleviates this issue, Chansey still finds itself struggling to handle said threats and it will be forced out most of the time due to it being unable to perform its role.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye: Chansey is completely helpless against Mega Sableye, as it is immune to Seismic Toss and Magic Bounce bounces back Toxic. However, it is important to note that Chansey takes next to no damage from Foul Play and Sableye cannot stop Chansey from passing Wish or using Heal Bell without carrying the rare Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon immune or Resilient to Toxic: Steel-types such as Mega Lucario and Necrozma-DM are able to use Chansey as a setup fodder, as they can only be damaged by Seismic Toss. Naganadel can set up Nasty Plot freely against Chansey without Seismic Toss. Against Confide variants, Naganadel can set up to the point where it will have enough boosts to OHKO Chansey with boosted Devastating Drake. Refresh Calm Mind Arceus formes are able to fully set up on Chansey lacking Confide. Rest users such as Giratina and Zygarde-C are impossible for Chansey to take down, as the former uses Pressure and the latter uses its colossal HP stat to PP stall Chansey out of Toxic and Seismic Toss. Steel-types like Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and Magearna take advantage of Chansey's high HP stat with Leech Seed in the former two's case and Pain Split in the latter's.</p> <p><strong>Removal of Eviolite: Losing Eviolite significantly hampers Chansey's role, as it greatly reduces its overall bulk, leaving it no longer able to check Xerneas and Primal Kyogre, the two most important threats it is tasked to handle. Trick from Mewtwo not only rids Chansey of Eviolite but also locks Chansey into one move with a Choice item, leaving it even more passive than it already is and unable to fulfill its role efficiently. Knock Off from Yveltal, Deoxys-A, and even Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, and Landorus ends up crippling Chansey.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure: Despite Chansey's colossal special bulk, it is going to be a huge burden for it to handle multiple threats by itself. Since it must be as healthy as possible to check Pokemon it must switch into, Chansey will find itself using Soft-Boiled almost every turn it is on the field, possibly delaying the use of Wish or Heal Bell to keep itself from getting into range of 2HKOs. Entry hazards on the field sometimes cause Chansey to be KOed by a series of attacks that it would normally survive. Some examples of this include Stealth Rock guaranteeing the 2HKO with +2 Focus Blast from Xerneas, +1 Origin Pulse from Primal Kyogre, and Precipice Blades from defensive Primal Groudon if Chansey is even slightly weakened.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Soft-Boiled allows Chansey to stay healthy and check special attackers it is tasked to handle.</li> <li>Heal Bell cures teammates' status conditions, which is especially helpful if Chansey is paired with teammates such as Giratina and defensive Tyranitar that rely on Rest to restore health.</li> <li>Toxic lets Chansey punish threats like support Arceus formes, Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and Geomancy Xerneas, should they try taking advantage of Chansey's passivity, by putting them on a timer.</li> <li>The last moveslot is flexible depending on the rest of the team. Wish lets Chansey keep teammates like Primal Groudon, Giratina and any Pokemon that does not have a reliable form of recovery, and thanks to Chansey's high HP stat, it often ends up restoring most of their health.</li> <li>Confide lets Chansey prevail against Calm Mind Kyogre, Z-Geomancy Xerneas, and Refresh Calm Mind Arceus formes, which would otherwise use it as setup fodder. The move also bypasses Substitute, meaning Chansey can check the former even if it has Substitute up.</li> <li>Seismic Toss is another move that can be opted for, letting Chansey do consistent damage to Steel-types and break Substitutes.</li> <li>Chansey can use Stealth Rock as well, but forgoing Wish keeps Chansey from effectively keeping its teammates healthy, and forgoing Confide means Chansey can no longer handle Refresh Calm Mind Arceus formes and Z-Geomancy Xerneas, both of which are formidable threats to defensive teams.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>It is more efficient to invest EVs into Defense and Special Defense, since Chansey already has a very high HP stat.</li> <li>Eviolite further increases Chansey's already impressive bulk.</li> <li>252 Defense EVs along with a Bold nature let Chansey take two Precipice Blades from defensive Primal Groudon and two Sunsteel Strikes from defensive Necrozma-DM if necessary.</li> <li>A Calm nature is another option that lets Chansey escape 2HKOs from +1 Primal Kyogre's Origin Pulse and +2 Xerneas's Focus Blast. If this nature is opted for, Chansey should be paired with defensive roadblocks like Giratina.</li> <li>Natural Cure is the best ability for Chansey, letting it cure itself of status upon switching out without spending a turn to use Heal Bell.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Chansey should be switched into special attackers, such as most Arceus formes, Xerneas, Primal Kyogre, Kyurem-W, and Lunala. Thanks to its significant Special bulk, Chansey can handle most damage from said threats if they are unboosted.</li> <li>Switching Chansey into predicted status moves is a promising idea; Chansey can absorb Toxic from the likes of Arceus formes and Lugia thanks to Natural Cure curing said status upon switching.</li> <li>Chansey should focus on spreading status if given the opportunity to switch in by using Toxic on support Arceus formes and defensive Primal Groudon. This is especially important regarding the fact that they are premier users of and Defog and Stealth Rock, respectively, and entry hazards are something that passive team relies on quite a lot to wear down foes.</li> <li>Soft-Boiled should be used as often as possible, since Chansey has to be near full health to check Xerneas and Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>Heal Bell should be used under consideration, since it has only 8 PP, especially if the battle is going to be long enough for status moves to be a significant factor in winning.</li> <li>Chansey should avoid Mega Gengar, Gothitelle, and Dugtrio by any means necessary, since once Chansey is trapped, it will be removed. Until said trappers are removed, Chansey should refrain from switching in recklessly, since double switching is dangerous for Chansey even when paired with dedicated Pursuit trapper.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Due to Chansey's passivity, it is usually fit on semi-stall and stall teams, though it can also justify use on balance teams.</li> <li>A dedicated Pursuit trapper is mandatory to keep Chansey safe from Mega Gengar, and in this aspect, Marshadow and Tyranitar are great partners. The former weakens or KOes Mega Gengar, Gothitelle, and Dugtrio with Pursuit while forcing them out and makes up for Chansey's passivity with its offensive presence, while the latter has more defensive presence by acting as a check to Ho-Oh and Mega Mewtwo Y and also provides Stealth Rock support.</li> <li>Mega Sableye is able to switch into Celesteela and Ferrothorn, which would otherwise use Leech Seed on Chansey and recover themselves. Mega Sableye also does a great job controlling entry hazards to let Chansey preserve its HP and can effectively switch into Knock Off. Another one of its strengths is its ability to handle Marshadow and Deoxys-A well. In return, Chansey is able to switch into most special attackers that would overpower Mega Sableye and transfer Wish.</li> <li>Giratina is able to handle most physical attackers, most notably Primal Groudon and Mega Lucario, which heavily threaten the aforementioned common partners. It also provides Defog support to keep the field clean of entry hazards, switches into Fighting-type attacks, and uses Pressure to deplete the opposing team's PP. Giratina appreciates Wish support from Chansey and can opt to use Rest without Sleep Talk thanks to Heal Bell. Giratina-O is an alternative option to check Primal Groudon better in exchange of lower bulk and lack of Pressure.</li> <li>Primal Groudon is another good partner that appreciates Wish and cleric support from Chansey. It provides Stealth Rock support, threatens Steel-types, acts as a secondary check to Primal Kyogre and Xerneas, and weakens physical attackers with potential burn from Lava Plume. It also makes up for Chansey's passivity to large extent when paired with Chansey on balance teams.</li> <li>Ho-Oh is another teammate that aids Chansey by handling Xerneas and Arceus formes. Ho-Oh appreciates cleric support from Chansey, since it can play more aggressively against Arceus formes. It also threatens opposing Steel-types with Sacred Fire, and said move also spreads burns that give Chansey room to breathe against physical attackers.</li> <li>Lugia can also be paired with Chansey due to the cleric support it appreciates, and it is capable of handling Naganadel thanks to Multiscale.</li> <li>Zygarde-C can stay healthy without losing too much momentum thanks to Chansey's Wish and cleric support that lessen the necessity to use Rest often. In return, it can use its colossal bulk to prevail against Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, Marshadow lacking Hidden Power Ice, Ho-Oh, Swords Dance Arceus formes, and Mega Lucario.</li> <li>Support Arceus formes also appreciate Chansey's Wish and cleric support. Arceus-Fairy is able to shut down most Marshadow variants and threaten Yveltal, which concerns Chansey with Knock Off and Taunt. It is also able to force out Mega Sableye, which otherwise completely shuts down Chansey. Arceus-Ground checks Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence, and Mega Lucario.</li> <li>Xerneas is another partner that can force out Mega Sableye, Marshadow, and Yveltal, which otherwise massively bother balance teams or stall teams in the former's case. Chansey is able to offer Wish support in return. If Xerneas is running Aromatherapy, it can let Chansey use both Wish and Confide.</li> </ul> "

    "overview": "<ul> <li>A strong ability in Parental Bond synergizes well with Seismic Toss to boost Mega Kangaskhan's damage to acceptable levels, as well as granting it decent utility through amplifying secondary effects.</li> <li>Fake Out gives Mega Kangaskhan a niche as an anti-lead with the ability to break the Focus Sash of other dedicated leads such as Smeargle and has strong synergy with residual damage such as from Toxic Spikes.</li> <li>Despite its decent defensive stats, Kangaskhan lacks useful resistances outside of its immunity to Ghost-type attacks. Due to this, it can easily be broken through by the offensive titans of the metagame, such as Primal Groudon and Marshadow, and cannot take on many threats by itself in a one-on-one scenario.</li> <li>Due to the naturally high HP stat of many threats in the tier, Mega Kangaskhan requires heavy support, typically from Toxic Spikes, to achieve crucial 2HKOs with Seismic Toss and amplify Fake Out damage. This greatly restricts the types of teams that Mega Kangaskhan can fit on.</li> <li>However, using Mega Kangaskhan denies the use of other powerful Mega Pokemon, particularly Mega Gengar, a far stronger Pokemon overall that can make use of Toxic Spikes support just as well. Mega Kangaskhan also faces heavy competition from other overall superior Pokemon that benefit from Toxic Spikes such as Dragon Dance Zygarde-C.</li> <li>Mega Kangaskhan fits on few teams, provides little defensive synergy, and is generally outclassed by other offensive Pokemon.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Power-Up Punch can be run to boost Mega Kangaskhan's Attack, but it is blocked by Ghost-types, and Seismic Toss with Parental Bond already does respectable damage that isn't reliant on Mega Kangaskhan's Attack stat.</li> <li>Earthquake or Bulldoze offers super effective damage against Primal Groudon and Steel-types; however, Seismic Toss already does serviceable damage against these targets. Furthermore, as a form of speed control, Bulldoze fails to hit non-grounded Pokemon such as Mega Salamence and Arceus-Flying, allowing them to set up on Mega Kangaskhan.</li> <li>Ice Punch is an option for coverage against Zygarde-C and Mega Salamence but lacks utility outside its effective 19% freeze chance.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Marshadow</strong>: Marshadow is immune to Fake Out, Body Slam, and Seismic Toss and is not hit super effectively by Crunch, though it is threatened by Shadow Claw. In return it can threaten to OHKO Mega Kangaskhan with its super effective STAB Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye</strong>: Mega Sableye is immune to Mega Kangaskhan's STAB attacks and takes little damage from any of its coverage moves. Additionally, it can also bounce back Toxic Spikes and Toxic, which Mega Kangaskhan often relies on to amplify its damage against bulkier foes.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde-C</strong>: Unless Mega Kangaskhan is running Ice-type coverage, defensive Zygarde-C will easily wall Mega Kangaskhan with its tremendous bulk and retaliate with status, phazing, or wearing down Mega Kangaskhan with Thousand Arrows. Offensive Zygarde-C can make use of its massive HP stat to set up multiple Dragon Dances on Mega Kangaskhan before attempting to sweep.</p> <p><strong>Mega Lucario</strong>: Mega Lucario is able to outspeed Mega Kangaskhan and threaten to OHKO it with Adaptability-boosted Close Combat or set up Swords Dance.</p> <p><strong>Other Ghost-types</strong>: Thanks to their immunity to Normal- and Fighting-type attacks, Ghost-types such as Mega Gengar and Giratina can switch into Mega Kangaskhan and threaten it with status or powerful attacks. Mega Gengar and Giratina can also remove Toxic Spikes, which Mega Kangaskhan often relies on for damage, through Defog or just switching in. However, they have to be wary of Crunch, and if Kangaskhan has not Mega Evolved yet, it can damage them with Normal- and Fighting-type attacks thanks to Scrappy.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn: Ferrothorn is able to deal considerable amounts of damage to Mega Kangaskhan due to Parental Bond triggering Iron Barbs twice, and Ferrothorn can heal off most of the damage it takes with Leech Seed, Leftovers, and Protect.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls</strong>: Bulky foes with reliable recovery, such as Lugia and support Arceus formes, can stall out Seismic Toss with Roost or Recover and can only be broken through with the support of teammates or the chance of paralysis from Body Slam.</p> <p><strong>Chansey: Thanks to its immense HP stat, Chansey takes little damage from Seismic Toss and is not 2HKOed by Body Slam due to its Eviolite. It can then provide its team with cleric or Stealth Rock support or whittle down Mega Kangaskhan with Toxic or Seismic Toss.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Offensive Pokemon</strong>: Although they have a hard time switching into Seismic Toss, the likes of Primal Groudon, Yveltal, and Primal Kyogre can easily survive an attack and KO Mega Kangaskhan in return.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Fake Out gives Mega Kangaskhan free chip damage the first turn it switches in and possibly stalls a turn of residual damage.</li> <li>Seismic Toss is Kangaskhan's main damage source. As its damage output isn't reliant on Mega Kangaskhan's Attack stat, it allows Mega Kangaskhan to freely invest in other stats. It also bypasses the Defense stat to take advantage of bulky foes with low HP such as Toxapex and Shuckle, though this also leaves its damage output lacking against targets with high HP stats.</li> <li>Shadow Claw gives Mega Kangaskhan super effective coverage against most Ghost-types, which are immune to Kangaskhan's STAB attacks and Seismic Toss after it Mega Evolves.</li> <li>Crunch is an alternative coverage move against Ghost-types that adds some power and a chance to drop the foe's Defense stat in exchange for being unable to hit Marshadow super effectively.</li> <li>Sucker Punch can be run instead of Crunch or Shadow Claw, allowing Mega Kangaskhan to revenge kill fast Psychic-types such as Ultra Necrozma and Mega Mewtwo Y in tandem with Fake Out. However, it is much less reliable against Ghost-types, as many rely on status instead of direct attacks to take out Mega Kangaskhan.</li> <li>Body Slam is a decently powerful STAB option with a high chance of paralysis thanks to Parental Bond. This grants Kangaskhan a lasting, though unreliable, method of crippling many threats. The possibility of the foe being paralyzed before it can move can also let Mega Kangaskhan break through walls that would otherwise stall it out with Recover, such as support Arceus formes.</li> <li>Rock Tomb is an alternate form of speed control that offers coverage against Flying-types, notably OHKOing offensive Ho-Oh and preventing Mega Salamence from setting up Dragon Dance on Mega Kangaskhan. It is preferred over Body Slam if Mega Kangaskhan is paired with Toxic Spikes support.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>The defensive investment allows Mega Kangaskhan to survive a Double-Edge from Mega Salamence, a Focus Blast from Lunala, and a Precipice Blades from Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock as well as two neutral Judgments from support Arceus formes from full health.</li> <li>232 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Mega Kangaskhan to outspeed everything up to and including Lunala and Yveltal.</li> <li>The remaining EVs are invested in Attack to increase Mega Kangaskhan's damage output.</li> <li>Scrappy is the ability of choice pre-Mega Evolution, giving Kangaskhan the option to damage Ghost-types with Fake Out, Body Slam, and Seismic Toss before Mega Evolving.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Attempt to status foes or set down entry hazards, particularly Toxic Spikes, before sending out Mega Kangaskhan, as its damage output is often sorely lacking without the support of residual damage. For example, one layer of Toxic Spikes means support Arceus formes are no longer able to stall out Seismic Toss with Recover and nets Mega Kangaskhan the 2HKO on defensive Primal Groudon with Seismic Toss.</li> <li>Fake Out gives Mega Kangaskhan a safe way to damage foes and Mega Evolve and can be especially helpful in stalling out a turn of residual damage, particularly against a boosted foe such as Geomancy Xerneas. However, avoid being too predictable with Fake Out, as some switch-ins hoping to take advantage of Fake Out's low damage output, such as Necrozma-DM, can be heavily punished with a different move such as Seismic Toss.</li> <li>Kangaskhan can opt to not Mega Evolve immediately to retain Scrappy, allowing it to damage and immobilize Ghost-types with Fake Out or attempt to paralyze them with Body Slam.</li> <li>Make use of Kangaskhan's Ghost-type immunity and decent bulk to take on threats that cannot outspeed or OHKO it such as Lunala and Calm Mind Arceus formes in a pinch, either slowing them down with Body Slam or Rock Tomb for another teammate to take them on or dealing significant damage with its STAB attacks or coverage.</li> <li>Recognize what threats Mega Kangaskhan can or cannot take on in a one-on-one scenario and, if necessary, preserve it against threats it cannot defeat, as Mega Kangaskhan's Fake Out can be useful against sweepers that have set up and Seismic Toss can clean up weakened teams later on in the game.</li> <li>If running Body Slam, Mega Kangaskhan can be played recklessly to try and spread paralysis in matchups where it is otherwise of little use.</li> <li>Using Body Slam or Rock Tomb to slow down foes before attacking with Seismic Toss the next turn can help maximize Mega Kangaskhan's damage output against faster Pokemon.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Toxapex is one of Mega Kangaskhan's best partners, providing it with both a check to Fighting-types and Toxic Spikes support. The residual damage from a layer of Toxic Spikes lets Mega Kangaskhan's Seismic Toss crucially 2HKO support Arceus formes and defensive Primal Groudon and synergizes well with Fake Out. Cloyster is an alternative Toxic Spikes setter that trades Toxapex's durability and ability to switch into Fighting-types for a much greater offensive presence and the ability to remove entry hazards with Rapid Spin.</li> <li>Dark types such as Yveltal, Arceus-Dark, and Tyranitar can take on Ghost-types for Mega Kangaskhan. Additionally, Tyranitar can trap Mega Gengar with Pursuit, removing a prominent threat to both Mega Kangaskhan and any Toxic Spikes setter it may be paired with.</li> <li>Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy provide Mega Kangaskhan with a solid check to Marshadow, Zygarde-C, and Mega Sableye, all of which Mega Kangaskhan has trouble with.</li> <li>Primal Groudon can set Stealth Rock, blanket checks many offensive threats to Mega Kangaskhan, and pressures many of Mega Kangaskhan's defensive answers, such as Giratina and Zygarde-C, with powerful STAB attacks, coverage, and Toxic.</li> <li>Ultra Necrozma can lure Mega Sableye, which walls Mega Kangaskhan, and break through it with Swords Dance-boosted Outrage.</li> </ul> "

  "Gyarados": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Mega Gyarados differentiates itself from other setup sweepers like Mega Salamence and Rayquaza with its access to Mold Breaker and Taunt, which lets it easily break through stall teams.</li> <li>Apart from being a formidable threat to stall teams, Mega Gyarados is capable of checking a number of dangerous threats. Intimidate and a Flying typing prior to Mega Evolution allow Gyarados to check Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Mega Lucario. A Dark typing gives Mega Gyarados an upper hand against Ghost-types, and forces mind games against Ultra Necrozma and Marshadow. These useful defensive utilities can justify a spot for Mega Gyarados on both offensive and balanced teams.</li> <li>While those niches are notable, Stealth Rock tends to undermine Mega Gyarados's usefulness. Mega Gyarados also lacks initial pressure due to its rather weak STAB moves and mediocre Speed, which tends to limit its ability to shut down the likes of support Arceus formes, as it is slower than them before Dragon Dance. These drawbacks mean that Mega Gyarados is somewhat reliant on its teammates to effectively function and successfully set up without taking excessive damage from attacks and status.</li> <li>A general lack of damage output leaves Mega Gyarados competing with Mega Salamence and Zygarde-C, both of which are far more powerful and threatening setup sweepers that also have valuable defensive capabilities.</li> <li>Gyarados is checked by common threats in the tier, such as Zygarde-C, Mega Salamence, and, after Mega Evolution, Primal Groudon. Fairy-types like Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy are problematic for Mega Gyarados as well.</li> </ul> ",

Arceus-Fairy is more problematic due to its higher bulk and access to recovery. Magearna can revenge kill Mega Gyarados as long as it has not taken excessive prior damage, but it fails to properly handle Earthquake variants.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde-C: Zygarde-C takes pathetic damage from even boosted attacks from Mega Gyarados, and even Ice Fang fails to significantly threaten it. To make this worse, Mega Gyarados cannot shut down Zygarde-C with Taunt due to Dragon Tail phazing it regardless. Offensive variants can also phaze Mega Gyarados with Dragon Tail or potentially set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Mega Salamence</strong>: Mega Salamence's high physical bulk and Intimidate prior to Mega Evolution makes it one of the better checks to Mega Gyarados. Without Ice Fang, Mega Gyarados can only 2HKO Mega Salamence with +1 Crunch, while Adamant Mega Salamence can set up on Mega Gyarados or simply OHKO back with Double-Edge after Stealth Rock and some prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: While Primal Groudon dislikes taking on Gyarados due to its immunity to Ground and resistance to Fire, it can take a boosted attack from Mega Gyarados and retaliate with Precipice Blades. Even boosted Earthquake fails to KO offensive Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock damage. The fact that Primal Groudon is the most relevant Stealth Rock user is bad news for Gyarados as well.</p> <p><strong>Yveltal</strong>: Yveltal easily checks Mega Gyarados lacking Waterfall, and can 2HKO it with Life Orb-boosted Oblivion Wing. Defensive Yveltal also 2HKOes +1 Mega Gyarados with Dark Aura-boosted Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn</strong>: Ferrothorn can take boosted Crunch and retaliate with Power Whip, which KOes Mega Gyarados after Iron Barbs and some prior damage. However, Ferrothorn lacking Power Whip is set up on by Mega Gyarados.</p> <p><strong>Zekrom</strong>: Zekrom can take any hit from Mega Gyarados apart from +1 Earthquake and OHKO back with Bolt Strike.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Scarf users like Xerneas and Yveltal can revenge kill Mega Gyarados.

An Adamant nature is an alternative option to provide Mega Gyarados with extra power to achieve a few benchmarks; with Stealth Rock support or Aqua Tail, Adamant Mega Gyarados can achieve OHKOs on Marshadow, Giratina-O, and Lugia at +1.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>To fully take advantage of Mega Gyarados's defensive capabilities, keep the field clean of entry hazards and prevent it from taking other unnecessary damage from weak attacks or status moves.</li> <li>Do not recklessly Mega Evolve Gyarados, as Intimidate and its Flying typing allow it to check foes like Primal Groudon and Mega Lucario, which it cannot do after Mega Evolution. Mega Gyarados also somewhat lacks physical bulk without Intimidate, so do not overestimate its durability.</li> <li>Gyarados can support its team by softening physical attackers with Intimidate and preventing the likes of Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM from netting excessive damage on its team. Many teams employ checks like Xerneas and Mega Salamence that comfortably take on Mega Gyarados, so setting up early-game is not the best move unless the damage Mega Gyarados can deal to such foes is needed for other teammates.</li> <li>Gyarados uses common Pokemon found on stall teams like Arceus-Ground, Mega Sableye, Chansey, Giratina, and Lugia as setup fodder. While some of them are completely shut down by Taunt, other foes like Mega Sableye can still inflict considerable amount of damage to Mega Gyarados, and the likes of defensvie Zygarde-C, Giratina, and Lugia can prevent Mega Gyarados from setting up on them if carrying Dragon Tail. To facilitate the sweep, keep Gyarados in pristine condition until its checks have been weakened or eliminated, keep it away from status moves by any means necessary, and set up on a passive and slow foe; the latter is especially important, as Mega Gyarados is slower than Arceus formes and other foes that can inflict status on Mega Gyarados before they are afflicted by Taunt. If Dragon Tail users are problematic and cannot be dealt with properly, Gyarados can remain as the last Pokemon so it can't be phazed.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Entry hazard support is essential for Mega Gyarados to sweep successfully and achieve some crucial KOs at +1. Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM are reliable Stealth Rock users that are also some of the better checks to Fairy-types. Primal Groudon can also run Hidden Power Ice to weaken or eliminate Zygarde-C for Mega Gyarados. Ferrothorn sets Spikes to wear down Mega Gyarados's checks faster and checks Fairy-types. All of these Pokemon can also use Toxic to lure certain foes and put them on a timer and further facilitate Mega Gyarados's sweep. Hazard setters like Cloyster and Dialga are appropriate partners on more offensive teams.</li> <li>Xerneas is one of the best partners to Mega Gyarados for various reasons. Geomancy variants appreciate Mega Gyarados pressuring Steel-types and threatening special walls, while Xerneas can clean up weakened foes late-game. Choice Scarf variants are better checks to Yveltal and Zygarde-C, the latter of which is capable of setting up on Mega Gyarados on a forced switch. Cleric support from Aromatherapy and hazard removal with Defog are other fantastic support options that Xerneas has to offer.</li> <li>Other hazard removers like Arceus-Ground and Giratina-O help Gyarados to remain in pristine condition and serve as good checks to Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Powerful wallbreakers like Ultra Necrozma and Deoxys-A can pressure many defensive foes, and they appreciate Mega Gyarados threatening Ghost-types.</li> <li>Gyarados may struggle to set up against offensive teams due to offensive pressure. Many Pokemon that excel against offensive teams, such as mixed Rock Polish Primal Groudon, Yveltal, and Marshadow have good synergy with Gyarados, and they appreciate Gyarados threatening defensive teams.</li> <li>Deoxys-A and Tapu Lele have good offensive synergy with Mega Gyarados.

    "overview": "<ul> <li>The combination of Imposter and Choice Scarf allows Ditto to function as a formidable revenge killer, punishing opposing setup sweepers by copying them and their boosts while also outspeeding them thanks to Choice Scarf.</li> <li>Due to Ditto refreshing PP each time it switches out and its ability to copy opposing support moves, Ditto can also give its team an edge in PP wars against defensive threats.</li> <li>Ditto finds a niche on defensive teams that appreciate its ability to revenge kill threats that the team otherwise can't wall as well as Ditto's potential to offer some form of offensive presence and stalemate opposing defensive teams.</li> <li>However, Ditto is unable to revenge kill some common threats, notably setup sweepers carrying Substitute and Calm Mind Arceus formes. Additionally, Ditto does not copy the foe's HP stat, and thanks to the high HP stat of many threats in Ubers in comparison to Ditto, as well as Ditto's lack of a boosting item, it cannot win one-on-one versus many common threats and requires them weakened in order to effectively revenge kill them.</li> <li>Furthermore, due to its low HP, Ditto requires free turns to safely switch in, either after a teammate has fainted or through pivots, and may force risky plays in order to to bring it in without having to sacrifice a teammate. Ditto also has little defensive synergy in terms of walling threats, leaving its teammates often overwhelmed by offensive threats before it can safely come in to attempt to revenge kill. This compounds its unreliability, as immunities and resistances to the moves of the sweepers that it copies are common, and due to Ditto's Choice Scarf, it must correctly predict if the opponent is switching out, as well as the incoming switch-in, in order to claim a KO.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Ditto's IVs can be modified to obtain different Hidden Power types, such as Fire and Rock, to target Steel-types and Ho-Oh, respectively, when copying Xerneas with Imposter. Hidden Power Rock can also be effective when copying Primal Groudon or Marshadow carrying Hidden Power Ice, as Ho-Oh may try to switch in believing Ditto carries Hidden Power Ice too. Hidden Power Rock requires an IV spread of 31 / 30 / 30 / 31 / 30 / 0, while Hidden Power Fire requires an IV spread of 31 / 30 / 31 / 30 / 31 / 0.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Ditto's checks and counters vary drastically depending on what Pokemon it has transformed into through Imposter, so this section focuses on threats that prevent it from effectively revenge killing.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Users</strong>: Imposter fails to copy Pokemon behind a Substitute, leaving Ditto ineffective as a revenge killer against Substitute users such as Dragon Dance Zygarde-C and Extreme Killer Arceus, unless a teammate has broken their Substitute upon fainting.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind Arceus formes: Ditto is unable to effectively revenge kill Calm Mind Arceus formes such as Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Fairy, as it is locked into a move while the opposing Arceus is free to alternate between setting up or attacking and using Recover to heal off any damage Ditto has dealt. Calm Mind also boosts Arceus's Special Defense, meaning that Ditto will never be able to outdamage Recover outside of a lucky critical hit. Judgment additionally also fails to copy the Arceus forme's type due to Ditto not holding a Plate, leaving Ditto with only a weak, unboosted non-STAB attack.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers: Certain bulky setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Zygarde-C and Extreme Killer Arceus can easily survive a revenge killing attempt, even when boosted, before KOing Ditto due to its far lower HP stat.</p> <p><strong>Boosting Item Holders</strong>: Ditto is forced to hold a Choice Scarf and thus does not have access to its foe's Z-Moves or boosting items such as Life Orb and Choice Band. Due to this, it can be overpowered by the likes of Marshadow, Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Ultra Necrozma, despite outspeeding them, due to these threats surviving an attack from full health and retaliating with a more powerful attack to KO Ditto.</p> <p><strong>Trick Room: Trick Room turns Ditto's Choice Scarf against it, leaving it unable to outspeed its foes until the effect of Trick Room is over.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Ditto can only Speed tie with opposing Choice Scarf users and often has an unfavorable matchup against them due to their higher HP stat.</p> <p><strong>Paralysis and Item Removal</strong>: As Ditto is reliant on outspeeding the Pokemon that it copies in order to revenge kill them, paralysis or loss of its Choice Scarf makes Ditto unable to reliably revenge kill its targets.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Transform is the only legal move Ditto can learn. However, it is mostly useless due to Imposter activating upon Ditto switching in, and if Imposter fails, then Transform would as well.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Imposter is what makes Ditto viable, allowing it to copy the opposing Pokemon and all its stat changes.</li> <li>A Choice Scarf is essential for Ditto to perform its role as a revenge killer, allowing to outspeed any Pokemon it copies, unless both carry Choice Scarf or Trick Room is active.</li> <li>248 HP EVs maximize Ditto's HP while minimizing Struggle recoil.</li> <li>252 Defense EVs and 0 Speed IVs with a Relaxed nature minimize damage taken from an opposing Ditto's Struggle and lower Ditto's Speed so it hopefully moves after opposing Ditto to avoid being the first to KO itself with Struggle damage.</li> <li>The given IV spread gives Ditto Hidden Power Ice, granting it optimal coverage when copying opposing mixed Primal Groudon and Marshadow should they be carrying Hidden Power. This potentially allows Ditto to pick off Mega Salamence and Zygarde-C should it try to switch in.</li> <li>The remaining EVs are invested into Attack to slightly boost the power of Ditto's Struggle.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Use Ditto to revenge kill threatening boosted sweepers, such as Rock Polish Primal Groudon and Geomancy Xerneas.</li> <li>It is safest to bring Ditto into play after a teammate has fainted or through slow pivots. Without the latter, Ditto only has so many opportunities to switch into threats that it is relied on to revenge kill, often at great cost to its team, so it must carefully select what move it uses to make the most of each time it comes into play.</li> <li>Although switching directly in on Pokemon that can KO Ditto, such as Primal Groudon, is extremely risky, it may sometimes be necessary in order to avoid giving too much ground to the foe. Pivoting with teammates that discourage the use of moves that Ditto cannot switch in on can make such a play much safer. For example, Primal Groudon will be hesitant to use Precipice Blades against a Pokemon immune to Ground-type attacks or a Zygarde that will activate Power Construct if hit, potentially opening up an opportunity for Ditto to switch in.</li> <li>Ditto is often forced to lock into a specific move in order to revenge kill a foe, and thus Pokemon that can safely switch into that move can deny Ditto from being able to revenge kill its foe. As Ditto will likely have had to switch in after a teammate has fainted, this means its team has lost a valuable member for little in return if Ditto fails to claim a KO. This may force Ditto to use a risky coverage move to target the switch-in instead of revenge killing in order not to cede too much momentum.</li> <li>If all else fails, Ditto can function as a wincon, using its teammates as fodder in order to obtain as many free switches as possible. If this is the case, aim to target Pokemon on the opposing team that can wall a Choice-locked Ditto, either by wearing them down or by removing them with teammates, or use Ditto to nail them with coverage moves as they come in.</li> <li>Foes that can survive an attack from Ditto and OHKO it in return thanks to the difference in the HP stat or the power from a boosting item will need to be weakened in order for Ditto to effectively revenge kill them. Examples include Life Orb Marshadow and Ultra Necrozma without Outrage.</li> <li>Thanks to Imposter, Ditto ignores the Speed drop from Sticky Web, making it a great revenge killer against common Sticky Web sweepers.</li> <li>Ditto is unable to effectively revenge kill Trick Room sweepers, such as Swords Dance + Trick Room Necrozma-DM, as they outspeed Ditto during the duration of Trick Room and can KO it before it can attack. In the case of Necrozma-DM, it can even survive a boosted Earthquake if Ditto switches in as Necrozma-DM uses Swords Dance and sets up Trick Room before KOing Ditto. Attempt to take on such foes with other teammates when Trick Room is active or stall out Trick Room turns until the effect is over so Ditto can outspeed its foe once again.</li> <li>Ditto can switch into defensive foes, particularly those with reliable recovery and without status moves that can afflict Ditto, and proceed to stall them out to gain a PP advantage thanks to its PP refreshing each time it switches out. Notable targets that Ditto can wall include support Arceus without Toxic, Mega Sableye, and Blissey.</li> <li>Ditto can also come in on foes with support moves such as Heal Bell and Defog and take advantage of these moves to support its team without wasting any PP.</li> <li>Ditto can only effectively stay in for five turns at a time, after which it will be forced to use Struggle unless it has lost its Choice Scarf.</li> <li>Ditto can be used to scout the moveset of the opponent's Pokemon.</li> <li>Imposter's potential greatly expands the number of possible plays in-game depending on the opponent's Pokemon and movesets, so keep an eye out for creative ways you can use it.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Ditto can round off a mostly complete team looking for a revenge killer to deal with a range of threats that cannot be walled by a single Pokemon. Thus, a solid defensive backbone to deal with most relevant threats should be present with Ditto, as it relies on its teammates to switch into offensive foes. In return, they appreciate Ditto's ability to revenge kill any threats that may break through.</li> <li>On the other hand, Ditto can round out a frail offensive team that has little defensive synergy and relies on overwhelming offensive pressure to win or a specialized team that is dependent on executing a specific niche strategy and is thus unable to defensively cover many prominent threats. Ditto can function as a safety net should an opposing setup sweeper manage to set up, and it can also simply discourage the use of setup moves from the opponent altogether.</li> <li>Support Arceus formes, such as Arceus-Fairy, as well as Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Water, and Arceus-Dark carrying Ice Beam, can take on Dragon Dance Zygarde-C in particular, which Ditto finds difficult to effectively revenge kill thanks to Substitute. Additionally, they check a plethora of other threatening offensive Pokemon that Ditto cannot reliably handle; Arceus-Fairy checks Marshadow and Yveltal, Arceus-Dark checks Yveltal and Ghost- and Psychic-types, Arceus-Ground checks Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM, and Arceus-Water can take on the latter two in addition to Ho-Oh. All four of them also check Mega Salamence and Rayquaza. Another option is Choice Scarf Xerneas, which can function as a more offensive check to Zygarde-C. In return, Ditto can take on setup sweepers that support Arceus formes and Xerneas often cannot, such as Swords Dance Primal Groudon and Double Dance Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Physically defensive walls such as defensive Zygarde-C carrying Coil, Skarmory, Mega Sableye, and both Giratina formes can wall most Swords Dance Arceus formes, which can pose trouble for Ditto if they are carrying Substitute. On more offensive teams, Marshadow is an option to deal with Swords Dance Arceus behind a Substitute. Zygarde-C and Giratina can also deal with offensive Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon to varying extents, while Skarmory, Mega Sableye and Marshadow can help against Ultra Necrozma. All of them can also assist taking on Necrozma-DM, and they appreciate Ditto's ability to deter opposing setup sweepers that they cannot handle.</li> <li>Blissey and, to a lesser extent, Magearna, Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, and Primal Kyogre, can either wall or overpower Calm Mind Arceus formes for Ditto. All of them except Primal Kyogre can also switch into various threatening special attackers like Geomancy Xerneas. Blissey and Magearna can additionally provide cleric support with Heal Bell, while Magearna can also help Ditto find safe opportunities to come into play with Volt Switch. In return, Ditto can deter physically oriented wallbreakers from using Ditto's specially defensive teammates as setup fodder.</li> <li>Entry hazard setters can allow Ditto to use the threat of a revenge kill to rack up hazard damage on checks to Ditto's current transformation in an aggressive fashion, potentially paving the way for an Imposter sweep. Primal Groudon, Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and support Arceus formes can provide entry hazard support in addition to checking prominent offensive threats such as Primal Kyogre and Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Klefki is another option, which, in addition to setting Spikes, can blanket check offensive threats alongside Ditto by inflicting Prankster-boosted status. Klefki can also opt for Swagger, which synergizes well with Ditto by allowing it to copy the foe's Attack boosts, and can even use Fairy Lock to guarantee that Ditto revenge kills any target that KOes Klefki with the right timing.</li> <li>Defog and Magic Bounce users such as Ho-Oh, both Giratina formes, support Arceus formes, and Mega Sableye can keep Ditto's side of the field clear of hazards, preventing it from getting chipped each time it switches in. Ditto can support such teammates in the hazard war by potentially copying support moves like Stealth Rock, Defog and Heal Bell.</li> <li>Yveltal and Mega Scizor can potentially provide Ditto opportunities to switch in with U-turn, with the latter being able to lure in Primal Groudon so Ditto can copy it and threaten it out with its own super effective STAB move. Ditto can return the favor, as it commonly transforms into Pokemon that draw out resisted moves for Yveltal and Mega Scizor to switch into, such as Ground- and Steel-type moves targeted at Primal Groudon and Xerneas, respectively.</li> <li>Wallbreakers and other Pokemon strong against defensive teams can partner well with Ditto on more balanced or offensive teams to complement Ditto's strong matchup against offensive threats. Examples of powerful wallbreakers include mixed Swords Dance Primal Groudon, Calm Mind Primal Kyogre, Calm Mind Lunala, and Bulk Up Marshadow. Despite their lack of immediate power, stallbreaker Yveltal and Substitute + Dragon Dance Zygarde can also pose large issues for bulkier teams. Finally, Gothitelle can trap and remove key members of more defensive teams.</li> </ul> "

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Mewtwo's access to two Mega Evolutions makes it extremely versatile.</li> <li>Its high offensive stats allow it to effectively wallbreak early- and mid-game as well as clean up late-game.</li> <li>An excellent Speed tier means Mewtwo outspeeds many offensive threats in the metagame, including Marshadow, Ultra Necrozma, Naganadel, and anything slower.</li> <li>Mewtwo has an exceptional movepool that consists of powerful coverage, utility, and setup moves such as Ice Beam, Taunt, and Calm Mind.</li> <li>Mewtwo can beat a wide array of Pokemon such as Mega Salamence, Zygarde-C, Magearna, Tyranitar, support Arceus formes, and most defensive Steel-types depending on what coverage moves it opts to go for.</li> <li>Mewtwo also has amazing potential with Psychic Terrain support; it augments Mewtwo's sweeping potential by increasing the power of Psystrike and making Mewtwo immune to strong priority moves like Marshadow's Shadow Sneak.</li> <li>Though it has decent bulk for an offensive Pokemon, Mewtwo offers no defensive synergy because its typing lacks useful resistances.</li> <li>Mewtwo unfortunately cannot run all of the coverage moves it wants to. This leaves it checked by more Pokemon depending on the coverage it forgoes.</li> <li>Mewtwo also faces competition from Deoxys-A and Ultra Necrozma as a fast Psychic-type wallbreaker. Deoxys-A is faster, whereas Ultra Necrozma has multiple sets and thus similar versatility, and both don't take up a Mega slot. However, Fire Blast helps Mewtwo differentiate itself from said Pokemon.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Mewtwo has an expansive movepool consisting of many options it can utilize depending on what set it opts for.</li> <li>Thunder on Mega Mewtwo Y hits Arceus-Water, Lugia, and physically defensive Primal Kyogre for more damage. However, it is inaccurate and offers inferior coverage compared to Mewtwo's other moves.</li> <li>Future Sight is a powerful wallbreaking tool that pressures the opponent to switch, giving you the advantage and allowing you to make the appropriate play against the predicted switch-in, but Future Sight is hard to fit when Mewtwo needs as much coverage as possible.</li> <li>Aura Sphere is a perfectly accurate alternative to Focus Blast, but it is extremely weak, having only less than a 50% chance to OHKO Darkrai.</li> <li>Will-O-Wisp cripples physically offensive switch-ins like Necrozma-DM, Arceus-Ghost, and Alolan Muk, but it doesn't affect Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Psychium Z is plausible instead of Life Orb when using regular Mewtwo. Mewtwo's Calm Mind-boosted attacks make up for the loss of Life Orb, and +1 Shattered Psyche OHKOes many Arceus formes. Unfortunately, Deoxys-A fulfills the role of Psychium Z Mewtwo in a much more effective manner.</li> <li>Fire Punch, Thunder Punch, and Power-Up Punch on Mega Mewtwo X are all options to hit specific threats, but Mewtwo's other moves offer superior coverage that hits most of the tier.</li> <li>Brutal Swing OHKOes Lunala when Shadow Shield is down and 2HKOes Necrozma-DW.</li> <li>Bulk Up + Drain Punch enables Mega Mewtwo X to set up while increasing its longevity.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Note that Mewtwo's checks and counters will vary slightly depending on if it is Mega Mewtwo Y or Mega Mewtwo X. Not all of the below Pokemon check both Mewtwo formes.</p> <p><strong>Lunala and Necrozma-DW</strong>: Lunala and Necrozma-DW hard check any Mega Mewtwo Y set without Shadow Ball and can OHKO it with Moongeist Beam. Lunala and Necrozma-DW have high Special Defense and resist Psystrike, so they can come in on Mega Mewtwo Y rather easily. Both are also immune to Mega Mewtwo X's Low Kick and aren't 2HKOed by any of its coverage moves even when Shadow Shield is down, while they can threaten Mewtwo with Moongeist Beam. However, Lunala and Necrozma-DW get outsped by Mewtwo, and if Mewtwo is carrying Shadow Ball or Brutal Swing, Lunala is OHKOed without its Shadow Shield, and Necrozma-DW is hit hard.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: The rest of the Ghost-types within the tier all pose as threats to Mewtwo, as they are immune to Low Kick and can hit Mewtwo with super effective STAB moves. Arceus-Ghost can use Mega Mewtwo X as setup fodder and hit it with a super effective STAB attack. However, Mega Mewtwo Y can 2HKO Arceus-Ghost with Psystrike. Giratina and Giratina-O are not 2HKOed by Mega Mewtwo X's Ice Beam and can wall variants without it, but Mega Mewtwo Y can 2HKO them with Ice Beam. Aegislash threatens Mega Mewtwo Y with STAB moves and resists its main attacks, and if Mega Mewtwo Y isn't carrying Fire Blast or Shadow Ball, Aegislash completely walls it. Mega Mewtwo X can 2HKO Aegislash with Earthquake, though. Mega Sableye is immune to Psystrike and Zen Headbutt, is not 2HKOed by any of Mega Mewtwo X's coverage moves, can 2HKO Mewtwo with Foul Play, and can status it. Marshadow can revenge kill Mewtwo with Shadow Sneak if it has taken any chip damage, but it cannot switch into Mega Mewtwo Y.</p> <p><strong>Yveltal: Yveltal struggles to switch into Ice Beam, but it is immune to Psystrike, and once in safely, it can threaten Mewtwo with a powerful STAB move. Defensive Yveltal is not 2HKOed by any of Mega Mewtwo X's moves other than Stone Edge and can 2HKO it with Foul Play, but Mega Mewtwo Y can 2HKO defensive Yveltal with Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Psychic-types</strong>: Bulky Psychic-types such as defensive Necrozma-DM, Lugia, and defensive Solgaleo resist Psystrike, can take most of Mewtwo's coverage moves well, and can status Mewtwo in return or, in Necrozma-DM's case, hit it with a powerful Sunsteel Strike. Lugia also resists Low Kick. However, all of them are hit decently hard by Shadow Ball, Lugia is dented by Mega Mewtwo X's Stone Edge and Mega Mewtwo Y's Ice Beam, and Necrozma-DM and Solgaleo are hit super effectively by Earthquake and Fire Blast. Also, all of these bulky Psychic-types are stopped by Taunt for the most part.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fairy-types: Bulky Fairy-types like Arceus-Fairy, Xerneas, and Klefki take very little damage from Low Kick and threaten Mega Mewtwo X with super effective STAB attacks. Mega Mewtwo X cannot 2HKO Arceus-Fairy, which can OHKO back. Xerneas can beat Mega Mewtwo X if it doesn't run Iron Tail or Poison Jab. Klefki can come in on most of Mega Mewtwo X's attacks and cripple it with Thunder Wave, but it will be OHKOed by Earthquake. Most of these Fairy-types are also bulky enough to take on Mega Mewtwo Y and retaliate. Bulkier Xerneas sets can use Mega Mewtwo Y as setup fodder if it is not running Taunt, and Klefki can cripple it with Thunder Wave. However, they are still dented by Psystrike, and Klefki is nailed by Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Alolan Muk: Alolan Muk cannot be 2HKOed by any of Mega Mewtwo Y's attacks even at +1, and it can Pursuit trap Mewtwo or potentially poison it. However, Alolan Muk isn't a threat for Mega Mewtwo X due to Low Kick.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: None of Mega Mewtwo Y's attacks can 2HKO specially defensive Primal Groudon, which can hit back hard with Precipice Blades. However, Primal Groudon can be worn down by repeated attacks from Mewtwo. It isn't a reliable check to Mega Mewtwo X, however, as it risks being 2HKOed by Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh can come in on all of Mega Mewtwo X's attacks bar Stone Edge and OHKO it in return with Brave Bird or burn it with Sacred Fire. However, Stone Edge will OHKO Ho-Oh, and Mega Mewtwo Y can hurt it with Psystrike.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats and Priority</strong>: Faster Pokemon and revenge killers such as Pheromosa and Deoxys-A as well as Choice Scarf Yveltal, Xerneas, and Genesect can outspeed Mewtwo and do heavy damage to or KO it. Mega Mewtwo Y has the ability to outspeed Mega Gengar and Modest Deoxys-A, however. Furthermore, priority users such as Marshadow, Mega Scizor, and Extreme Killer Arceus can deter a potential Mewtwo sweep.</p> <p><strong>Status: In general, Mewtwo dislikes being inflicted with status. Paralysis severely hinders Mewtwo by lowering its Speed, thus leaving it vulnerable to attacks. Burns cripple Mega Mewtwo X by significantly lowering its power.</p> ",

Note that Mega Mewtwo X will have a very noticeable power drop.</li> <li>Mewtwonite X is used to become Mega Mewtwo X, granting Mewtwo a secondary Fighting typing, higher Attack, and increased bulk.</li> <li>Mewtwo gains Steadfast upon Mega Evolution, which is situationally useful against Choice Scarf variants of Shaymin-S and Genesect.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Mega Mewtwo X works best as an early- and mid-game wallbreaker that weakens checks for another Pokemon on your team to sweep.</li> <li>Because it is very fast, it can also be used to revenge kill slower threats with Low Kick or sweep on its own if the opposition is weakened enough.</li> <li>Mewtwo should be brought in safely by double switching or using a pivot, since it isn't bulky enough to switch into a powerful attack.</li> <li>Low Kick dents almost all Pokemon hit by it; Mewtwo should use this move as much as possible when wallbreaking.</li> <li>Taunt should be used liberally on defensive Pokemon to prevent them from using recovery, status, and utility moves.</li> <li>If Mega Mewtwo X has Ice Beam, it can stay in on Mega Salamence and Rayquaza and OHKO them. Similarly, Mewtwo can stay in on Ho-Oh and OHKO it if running Stone Edge.</li> <li>When using a set that is walled by Toxapex, it is often better to risk being burned and go for Taunt to prevent Toxic Spikes from being set up, followed by switching to a counter.</li> <li>One can opt to bluff a special attacking Mewtwo set in order to get a surprise KO. For example, sending Mewtwo in against a physical wall might entice the opponent to switch into a special wall like Alolan Muk, in which case Mega Evolving Mewtwo to hit them with a powerful Low Kick can lead to a quicker KO.</li> <li>Mega Mewtwo X can OHKO some boosted threats that Mega Mewtwo Y cannot, such as Calm Mind-boosted Arceus-Dark; therefore, if they stay in thinking Mewtwo cannot KO them, Mega Evolving Mewtwo will surprise them and stop a potential sweep.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Entry hazards help Mega Mewtwo X pressure the opposing team more. Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, Cloyster, and Dialga all have access to hazards.</li> <li>Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Ho-Oh check Xerneas. Mewtwo beats Zygarde-C for them in return as well as checking Arceus-Rock and Tyranitar for Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Dark-types such as Yveltal, Arceus-Dark, and Darkrai deal with the Ghost-types that trouble Mewtwo, particularly Lunala, Necrozma-DW, Arceus-Ghost, and Marshadow, as well as Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Fairy-types like Xerneas are great partners for Mewtwo because they check Dark-types, while Mewtwo can check the Steel-types that trouble them in return.</li> <li>Arceus-Ground and Zygarde-C are able to check Primal Groudon and Mega Salamence, and Zygarde-C can also beat Ho-Oh and Extreme Killer Arceus.</li> <li>Celesteela and Ferrothorn are able to check Xerneas and Extreme Killer Arceus; Celesteela also checks Mega Salamence, and Ferrothorn is able to deal with Primal Kyogre as well as set up entry hazards.</li> <li>Defog support Arceus formes such as Arceus-Water and Arceus-Fairy can remove entry hazards, particularly Toxic Spikes.

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Instead of using Shadow Tag to trap and revenge kill or PP stall a foe like Mega Gengar, Gothitelle, and Gothorita do, Wobbuffet takes advantage of its superior bulk to retaliate against certain threats after stomaching a heavy hit or leave a foe in an exploitable state by locking it into a move with Encore.</li> <li>Wobbuffet's bulk is also noteworthy for being able to ensure that Geomancy Xerneas will be dealt with before it proceeds to annihilate offensive teams, as it survives any boosted attack from full health to retaliate with Mirror Coat or lock Xerneas into any status move it carries.</li> <li>Access to Encore also serves as one of the crucial elements to Wobbuffet's viability, as Wobbuffet won't be easily taken advantage of by its checks the same way as Gothitelle and Gothorita, which can be left completely helpless against certain foes. This means Wobbuffet will not be left useless even if weakened and be able to prevent setup or potentially even reverse momentum by locking a foe into a setup move.</li> <li>Due to its tiny movepool, horrendous defensive typing, and lack of recovery moves, Wobbuffet's effectiveness is quite limited as a bulky trapper. Wobbuffet is almost impossible to viably fit in teams other than offense, an archetype that prefers Wobbuffet's ability to generate setup opportunities and check out-of-control foes in emergency over its longevity.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>A physically defensive EV spread can be used to take hits from Extreme Killer and physical Primal Groudon better, but worsening Wobbuffet's matchup against Geomancy Xerneas and support Arceus formes is generally not worth it.</li> <li>Wiki Berry heals half of Wobbuffet's HP when its HP decreases below 25%, but this is much harder to safely activate. However, extra recovery allow Wobbuffet to avoid 2HKOs from stronger attacks such as maximum Attack Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades and, after Stealth Rock damage, Water-type moves from offensive Primal Kyogre variants and Double-Edge from Adamant Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Leftovers can be considered, as it provides Wobbuffet with passive recovery, gives it some resilience against passive damage, and notably allows it to survive +2 Moonblast from Xerneas after Stealth Rock and Leftovers recovery.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Wobbuffet is offensively threatened by and has no way to effectively neutralize Ghost-types, as they cannot be trapped by Shadow Tag. Marshadow in particular can be troublesome, as it is immune to Counter and some variants can even set up Bulk Up on a forced switch or weaken Wobbuffet with Pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde: Zygarde has many ways to avoid getting hindered by Wobbuffet's trapping. Almost every offensive variant has Substitute, and a Zygarde behind Substitute can attack Wobbuffet without worrying about Counter once, forcing Wobbuffet to predict between locking Zygarde into Dragon Dance using Encore or using Counter to at least break the Substitute for teammates. Variants with Dragon Tail are less concerned about Encore, and others holding Groundium Z can still use Tectonic Rage while Encore-locked.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Yveltal, Arceus-Dark, and the rare Darkrai can hit Wobbuffet super effectively with their STAB moves without fearing retaliation thanks to their immunity to Mirror Coat.</p> <p><strong>Z-Move Users: Other Z-Move users like Necrozma-DM, Ultra Necrozma, Swords Dance Arceus-Ground, and Naganadel can set up on Wobbuffet and still attack a switch-in with a Z-Move through Encore, meaning they cannot be completely neutralized.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users: Taunt users like Mewtwo can prevent Wobbuffet from locking them into a move using Encore and set up on it without fear.</p> <p><strong>Mixed Attackers: Powerful mixed attackers like Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre can make predictions more difficult when Wobbuffet has to choose between using Counter and Mirror Coat. Wobbuffet can avoid some 2HKOs against mixed attackers with Sitrus Berry intact, however.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Trapped foes afflicted by Encore will be easily taken advantage of by Wobbuffet's teammates. Using Encore when Wobbuffet is no longer needed also prevents it from being set up on.</li> <li>Counter and Mirror Coat prevent Wobbuffet from being completely passive, returning doubled damage if Wobbuffet made a correct prediction. An attacking foe locked into Encore can be taken out by Wobbuffet itself if the attack isn't strong enough to take out Wobbuffet in a few hits. Note that Counter will not affect Ghost-types nor will Mirror Coat hit Dark-types.</li> <li>Though Wobbuffet is very slow, it can effectively utilize Destiny Bond to take down a threat after getting weakened. Due to Destiny Bond lasting until Wobbufet’s next turn, an opponent will likely have to spend two turns deciding between trading KOs or setting up and risking getting locked by Encore.</li> <li>While Safeguard may not seem like the most sensible utility move due to Wobbuffet's slow Speed leaving it vulnerable to most status ailment users, it can be used to prevent a foe locked into status moves like Toxic or Thunder Wave from statusing incoming teammates.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment with a Calm nature allows Wobbuffet to survive any attack from +2 Xerneas and minimize the chance it falls to +2 Moonblast after taking Stealth Rock damage. Specially defensive investment also helps with Wobbuffet's ability to stomach Judgment from support Arceus formes that it typically attempts to take advantage of.</li> <li>Custap Berry gives +1 priority to Wobbuffet's move when its health is 1/4 or below, allowing Wobbuffet to use effectively Destiny Bond and take down a foe.</li> <li>Sitrus Berry heals a quarter of Wobbuffet's HP when its HP decreases below 50%, enabling it to take another hit against support Primal Groudon after Precipice Blades or Overheat and avoid other potential 2HKOs. Sitrus Berry also enables Wobbuffet to check mixed Rock Polish Primal Groudon from full health, as it can avoid a 2HKO from Fire Blast or Precipice Blades with Sitrus Berry recovery, lock Primal Groudon into a move, and KO back the next turn using Counter or Mirror Coat.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Wobbuffet aims to punish bulky Pokemon that its team struggles to bypass. While it does not necessarily cripple trapped foes by weakening them with Counter and Mirror Coat, it can benefit its team more by giving free switches with Encore.</li> <li>This means Wobbuffet can switch into or, if possible, double switch into support Arceus formes or relatively passive Pokemon like defensive Necrozma-DM to easily survive a hit and lock them with Encore. This will either force them to keep attacking Wobbuffet with the same move or lock them into status moves like Stealth Rock, Defog, Recover, and Toxic. Attacks can be handled with Counter or Mirror Coat, and status moves make them fodder for Wobbuffet's teammates.</li> <li>Double switching into passive Pokemon can preserve Wobbuffet's health so that it may have another chance to trap and temporarily neutralize a foe later in the game.</li> <li>Wobbuffet is likely going to be hit by status moves like Toxic while locking a foe into Encore, so Safeguard should be used afterwards to prevent its teammate from getting crippled.</li> <li>A healthy Wobbuffet can also take more aggressive approach to lock stronger foes into Encore. However, it is quite dangerous to recklessly create a confrontation with powerful and unpredictable foes like Primal Groudon that have varying ways to 2HKO Wobbuffet. Xerneas, which Wobbuffet avoids a 2HKO from, should be faced with caution as well. If Geomancy Xerneas hits Wobbuffet with Moonblast on switch, it can force a risky mind game between using Mirror Coat on the next Moonblast or punishing Geomancy with Encore. Get a safe switch in against these Pokemon if possible.</li> <li>A lead Pokemon will likely be taken down by a Pokemon that Wobbuffet will proceed to trap next, and this means there will be an opportunity to acquire some information about opposing lead Pokemon depending on the moves they carry or the damage they do to the lead Pokemon.</li> <li>Against offensive teams, Wobbuffet will struggle to be able to trap multiple foes. Identify which offensive Pokemon will be threatening to Wobbuffet's team. Wobbuffet may have to be left healthy if the team is not able to adequately deal with Geomancy Xerneas and Rock Polish Primal Groudon, but if its team has enough ways to pressure the opposing team, it can be used to allow its team to immediately become threatening after it cripples a foe with Encore and either cause serious damage early-game or secure a win against weakened teams that attempt a comeback by using setup moves or removing entry hazards.</li> <li>Do not worry much about Wobbuffet's longevity. While excessive layers of entry hazards can mess with Wobbuffet's ability to effectively trap foes, Wobbuffet will typically trade itself for the momentum or ideal setup conditions it generates for the team. Use Wobbuffet as sacrifice fodder if it is no longer needed, and if it is one-on-one situation against a foe after getting weakened, use Encore before going down so that a foe it is facing won't get to set up on Wobbuffet without getting punished.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>There are multiple ways for Wobbuffet's team to draw in Pokemon like support Arceus formes, which Wobbuffet can turn into setup fodder for teammates. Offensive teams that typically employ Wobbuffet can have a dedicated lead like Cloyster or Deoxys-S to set entry hazards or powerful yet commonly prepared-for threats like Primal Groudon and Xerneas to draw in passive foes. Note that letting foes remove entry hazards in exchange of Wobbuffet turning them into setup fodders is not an ideal decision in cases where there are bulkier foes that need entry hazards to be effectively taken out.</li> <li>A number of setup sweepers can run rampant with Wobbuffet giving them a free turn to set up unharmed. Pokemon like Rayquaza, Mega Blaziken, and Naganadel, which can be devastating after a turn of setup but are typically too frail to successfully set up and remain healthy enough to survive a priority move, can have the perfect setup condition they desire. Rayquaza is also helpful for being one of the very few Pokemon that can take advantage of Primal Groudon locked into one its STAB moves and providing its team with extra security against sweepers with Extreme Speed. Lunala can check out some out-of-control sweepers in a pinch with Shadow Shield intact, and it can potentially set up Calm Mind while keeping its Shadow Shield with the free turn Wobbuffet generates for it.</li> <li>Marshadow should be strongly considered in Wobbuffet's team. It can offensively threaten any Ghost- and Dark-types apart from Mega Sableye and defensive Yveltal and check certain Z-Move users like Ultra Necrozma and Swords Dance Arceus-Ground, which can still use their Z-Moves after getting locked into Encore. In addition, there are very few setup sweepers that are powerful enough to OHKO Wobbuffet and outspeed Marshadow at the same time with exceptions like Double Dance Primal Groudon, meaning Marshadow can threaten setup sweepers that Wobbuffet cannot defensively check with Spectral Thief, while some faster threats can be dealt by a healthy Wobbuffet in an emergency.</li> <li>Other setup sweepers like Rock Polish Primal Groudon, Geomancy Xerneas, and Extreme Killer Arceus are viable partners that can provide some defensive utility to the team, lessening the number of instances where Wobbuffet has to confront and attempt to cripple an offensive threat itself. Extreme Killer Arceus serves as a strong countermeasure against many offensive teams that Wobbuffet can have a harder time functioning against and checks Marshadow with a Chople Berry intact.</li> <li>Magearna can be considered, as it can generate momentum against certain foes to allow Wobbuffet to switch into the field unharmed, check Dark-types, and function as a more reliable check to Xerneas. Wobbuffet can hinder Primal Groudon and lock Arceus-Ground into an unfavorable move and potentially remove them if they are confirmed to be support variants.</li> </ul> "

Mega Lucario and offensive Necrozma-DM sets can also use Mega Scizor as setup fodder.

Zygarde-C can shrug off Mega Scizor's Toxic using Rest, and Mega Salamence can get rid of Toxic poison with Refresh or take advantage of Toxic poison if it is running Facade. However, the rest of these bulky attackers hate being hit with Toxic, and Arceus and Lunala must watch out for Superpower and Knock Off, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Will-O-Wisp: Will-O-Wisp from Mega Sableye, Mega Gengar, Giratina-O, and support Arceus formes cripples Mega Scizor, reducing its longevity, damage, and ability to check Xerneas.</p> ",

It also falls prey to Shadow Tag users and relies solely on residual damage and its teammates to inflict any damage to foes, although Shed Shell and Rocky Helmet can alleviate some of these problems to an extent.</li> <li>Skarmory faces competition with many bulky Steel-types in the tier; Celesteela has much better special bulk to check Deoxys-A and support Arceus formes, Ferrothorn is also a Spikes setter but is passive to a much lesser extent and checks Primal Kyogre, and Necrozma-DM is much harder to trap with Shadow Tag users and checks top-tier threats like Xerneas.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Taunt is a useful option to avoid Gothitelle trapping and prevent threats like Extreme Killer Arceus from getting excessive boosts, but this forces Skarmory to forgo Toxic, Spikes, or Defog and does not improve its matchup against the last foe, as Skarmory's low Speed prevents it from effectively stopping the foe from setting up.</li> <li>Counter lets Skarmory take a more offensive approach to punish physical attackers such as boosted Necrozma-DM and Mega Salamence. However, this involves prediction and is not so helpful against foes behind Substitute.</li> <li>Iron Defense makes Skarmory nigh impenetrable and lets it prevail against boosted threats like Necrozma-DM, Mega Salamence, and Arceus-Ground. The move is especially helpful when they are the last Pokemon on the team and either use their immunity to Toxic or set Substitute to set up against Skarmory. However, these threats should ideally be dealt with by Skarmory's teammates and Iron Defense forces Skarmory to forgo one of its utility moves, which would generally prove to be a better option. The fact that Skarmory loses the PP war against Necrozma-DM makes Iron Defense even harder to justify.</li> <li>Skarmory can run unique sets for offensive teams, ranging from a fast suicide lead with Stealth Rock and Taunt to an emergency check to a threat that utilizes Sturdy and Red Card. However, there are better options for suicide lead roles such as Deoxys-S, Excadrill, and Cloyster that provide much more utility than Skarmory would, and in this regard, these gimmick sets can't be justified to be used most of the time.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Trappers</strong>: If Skarmory lacks Shed Shell, it will be extremely vulnerable to Shadow Tag users, namely Mega Gengar and Gothitelle. The former switches into Skarmory without any concern due to its immunity to Toxic, and the latter can also cure itself of Toxic by using Rest. Both of them commonly carry Taunt and can force a trapped Skarmory to use Struggle and faint.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Skarmory struggles against Taunt users such as Yveltal, Mewtwo, Mega Gyarados, and Deoxys-S. Since Skarmory does not carry any attacking moves, it will be immediately forced to use Struggle or switch out.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Due to Skarmory's horrible special bulk, it is very easily overwhelmed by threats like Xerneas, Yveltal, Primal Kyogre, Lunala, and Arceus formes that can at least hit it for neutral damage with Judgment. None of them appreciate switching into Toxic, however.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh can use their Fire-type STAB moves to at worst heavily dent Skarmory and leave it unable to function as a wall. These threats typically carry Toxic themselves to put their checks on a timer, and in this regard, Skarmory and its team are greatly bothered by them in general. Mega Blaziken can OHKO Skarmory with Flare Blitz after Stealth Rock damage or set up Swords Dance on the forced switch, outspeeding the entirety of Skarmory's team in the process due to Speed Boost.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce: Due to Magic Bounce, Skarmory is discouraged from using any status moves in the first place against teams with Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie and essentially can do nothing to them.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers and Strong Attacks: Even when Skarmory is against physical attackers, it tends to struggle against certain threats with a lot of power. Mega Lucario 2HKOes Skarmory with Close Combat and can easily switch into Toxic. Life Orb Marshadow variants 2HKO Skarmory the same way after Stealth Rock damage, and variants with Marshadium Z can do unexpectedly large damage to Skarmory, possibly KOing it. Skarmory should also be wary of Necrozma-DM's boosted Searing Sunraze Smash, as it may severely weaken or KO Skarmory after some prior damage.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Roost allows Skarmory to remain healthy and consistently blanket check physical attackers.</li> <li>Whirlwind forcefully removes setup sweepers such as Necrozma-DM, Mega Salamence, Arceus-Ground, and Arceus from the field. The move also has benefits of bypassing Substitute as well as racking up damage on foes if entry hazards are up.</li> <li>Spikes leaves Skarmory with something very valuable to do after switching into a threat it walls. The hazard generally is helpful with wearing down foes and notably punishes most Toxic-immune Pokemon every time they switch into Skarmory.</li> <li>Skarmory can act as a Defog user, proving to be useful especially against defensive variants of Necrozma-DM and Arceus-Fairy.</li> <li>Toxic punishes Skarmory's offensive checks such as Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and most special attackers by putting them on a timer. Skarmory's tendency to draw in Defog users due to Spikes makes this move a great option to use on them as well.</li> <li>Stealth Rock can be run instead of Spikes if the rest of Skarmory's team is not carrying it, but Skarmory's tendency to draw in Ho-Oh and unfavorable matchups against other Stealth Rock setters such as Primal Groudon, Deoxys-S, and Dialga makes this inferior option in general.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum investment in Defense with a Bold nature allows Skarmory to be a great physical wall that avoids 2HKOs from Mega Salamence's +1 Double-Edge and Arceus-Ground's +2 Stone Edge after Stealth Rock damage.</li> <li>A more specially defensive EV spread of 248 HP / 16 Def / 244 SpD with a Calm nature is a viable option when Skarmory is opting for Defog so it could have a better matchup against support Arceus formes such as Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Ground at the cost of worsening Skarmory's ability to handle Necrozma-DM and Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Shed Shell allows Skarmory to escape from Mega Gengar and Gothitelle, which would otherwise trap and remove it.</li> <li>Rocky Helmet punishes physical attackers such as Necrozma-DM, Mega Salamence, Marshadow, and Arceus that attempt to inflict damage on Skarmory with contact moves. The item is especially useful against the former, which Skarmory would otherwise solely rely on Spikes damage and teammates to wear down.</li> <li>Leftovers provide Skarmory with passive recovery and notably lets it narrowly avoid the 2HKO from Life Orb Marshadow's Close Combat.</li> <li>Sturdy allows Skarmory to survive a hit from full HP and do something worthwhile the same turn if desperately needed.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Skarmory can switch into a plethora of physically offensive threats thanks to its bulk and typing. Feel free to switch in Skarmory against Necrozma-DM, Mega Salamence, Arceus-Ground, and Arceus and proceed to use Toxic to punish a switch-in or set Spikes.</li> <li>Setting up Spikes is usually more preferable than using Toxic because Skarmory will naturally draw in Defog users like support Arceus formes and Giratina-O, all of which are vulnerable to Toxic. That way, Skarmory can outlast them and start pressuring the opposing team with multiple layers of Spikes.</li> <li>If said threats set up on the switch, Whirlwind should be used to phaze them before they are able to overwhelm Skarmory with excessive boosts. Whirlwind can also be used to phaze opposing switch-ins to inflict damage if Spikes are up.</li> <li>Although Skarmory can generally feel free to use utility moves after switching in and walling a foe, it must not act recklessly when Mega Sableye or Shadow Tag users are present on the other team. However, Shed Shell lets Skarmory escape from the latter.</li> <li>Sets with Defog can take advantage of the typing to take on Stealth Rock users like Arceus-Fairy and Necrozma-DM and consistently remove entry hazards or spread Toxic.</li> <li>Roost should be used often, since some threats that Skarmory checks, such as Necrozma-DM and Dragon Dance Rayquaza, can surprise Skarmory with a powerful Z-Move; therefore, Skarmory should stay as healthy as possible. Staying healthy also lets Skarmory utilize Sturdy against its offensive checks by surviving a potential OHKO from full health.</li> <li>It is highly advised to switch Skarmory out against special attackers, as they will mostly end up severely damaging it.</li> <li>Skarmory should be wary of Fire-type coverage moves, as Skarmory is reliant on its typing to handle foes it usually switches into and finds itself getting overwhelmed if such coverage moves were not properly scouted beforehand. Examples of these include Fire Blast from Arceus formes, V-create from Rayquaza, and the rare Heat Wave from Ultra Necrozma.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Stealth Rock users complete a hazard stacking core with Skarmory. Tyranitar is a solid Stealth Rock user on defensive teams and traps Mega Gengar, which is greatly appreciated, especially if Skarmory lacks Shed Shell. Tyranitar is also a solid check to Yveltal and Ho-Oh, with the former overwhelming Skarmory with strong special attacks and Taunt and the latter having a way to hit Skarmory super effectively. Primal Groudon makes up Skarmory's passivity a lot as an alternative Stealth Rock user and checks Xerneas and Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>Blissey is one of the most reliable special walls in the tier that handles essentially all special attackers that Skarmory struggles against, with the exceptions of Yveltal and Mewtwo. In return, Skarmory checks the majority of the physical attackers that take advantage of Blissey, especially the likes of Substitute variants of Mega Salamence and Arceus assuming they aren't the last Pokemon. Chansey can be used instead if a more durable special wall is desired, but this leaves Skarmory's team more vulnerable against Shadow Tag users, which isn't too ideal.</li> <li>A number of common offensive threats appreciate Skarmory's Spikes support, as the entry hazard helps wear down their checks. Spikes support is extremely helpful, if not mandatory, for setup sweepers like Dragon Dance variants of Zygarde-C, Mega Salamence, and Rayquaza to successfully bypass their conventional checks like support Arceus formes. Zygarde-C in particular can take advantage of Spikes to facilitate its sweep by wearing down foes with Dragon Tail and Spikes on the field. As other threats like Xerneas and Calm Mind Arceus formes tend to draw in their checks, and as most of them are vulnerable to Spikes, Skarmory can be a considerable teammate for them as well.</li> <li>Various support Arceus formes pair with Skarmory. Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Water, and Arceus-Dragon all check Primal Groudon and provide Defog support. They also check offensive Zygarde-C, a threat that Skarmory cannot handle due to Thousand Arrows. Arceus-Ground in particular is a great check to Mega Lucario and can pick off Necrozma-DM in an event where Skarmory is KOed by boosted Searing Sunraze Smash. Arceus-Water and Arceus-Dragon are also good checks to Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Lugia is a good blanket check to Primal Groudon, Zygarde-C, and Mega Lucario. It can use Ice Beam to take care of Substitute variants of Zygarde-C and Mega Salamence if they are the last Pokemon left and cannot be phazed by Whirlwind. Lugia can also take advantage of Skarmory's Spikes support to wear down foes with Whirlwind.</li> <li>Ho-Oh and Toxapex are good checks to Mega Lucario as well. Ho-Oh checks Xerneas and spreads burn with Sacred Fire to make physical attackers almost useless against Skarmory, while Toxapex also spreads burn with Scald and provides Toxic Spikes support. Toxapex in particular can be helpful against the last foe behind Substitute, as it can prevent their setup with Haze.</li> <li>Giratina takes on most physical attackers that can overwhelm Skarmory such as Primal Groudon, Mega Lucario, and Ho-Oh. It also stands as a solid Defog user that can handle Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Mega Sableye shuts down passive walls that are immune or resilient to Toxic, such as Ferrothorn, Celesteela, Chansey, and defensive variants of Necrozma-DM. It also can take a more offensive approach to check Extreme Killer Arceus. Magic Bounce allows Skarmory's team to have the upper hand in hazard control.</li> <li>Defensive variants of Primal Kyogre provide a Fire-type immunity to the team with Primordial Sea and deal with support Arceus formes well thanks to massive special bulk and Rest. Defensive Kyogre sets can also use Scald to cripple physical attackers. In return, Skarmory puts Primal Kyogre's checks on timer with Toxic and wears down Primal Groudon and Ferrothorn with Spikes. Skarmory can also switch into Toxic for offensive variants of Primal Kyogre.</li> </ul> "

However, opposing Taunt users like Yveltal and Mega Gengar can be susceptible to Nuzzle.</p> <p><strong>Rapid Spin Users: Excadrill can undo Smeargle's Sticky Web with Rapid Spin and is immune to Nuzzle and Toxic Thread. Cloyster can also fulfill the same role but must be wary of Nuzzle and Toxic Thread.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Sweepers: Substitute sweepers such as Arceus-Ground and Zygarde cannot be touched by Nuzzle and are very threatening if Smeargle lacks Whirlwind. Both can set up with their respective moves and can be problematic for the rest of the team to deal with.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce: Magic Bounce users such as Mega-Sableye and Mega Diancie can easily deflect the majority of Smeargle's moveset. However, Nuzzle can easily cripple them.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types and Levitate Users: Flying-types like Yveltal and Mega Salamence and Levitate users like Giratina-O are immune to Smeargle's Sticky Web. Mega Salamence threatens Sticky Web teams with the Dragon Dance + Refresh set and is one of the most effective Defoggers.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Smeargle's base 75 Speed stat means that it is vulnerable to faster Pokemon like Yveltal and Excadrill that can pressure it with status or hazard removal. However, Focus Sash guarantees that Smeargle sets up at least one entry hazard.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Sticky Web is the premier utility move for Smeargle, allowing its otherwise slower teammates to outpace faster grounded Pokemon.</li> <li>Nuzzles allows Smeargle to cripple non-Ground-type Pokemon with paralysis and avoid being crippled by fast Taunt leads like Yveltal and Deoxys-S.</li> <li>Taunt prevents opposing Pokemon from easily setting up on Smeargle.</li> <li>Whirlwind is useful against setup Pokemon like Substitute + Dragon Dance Mega Salamence and Zygarde, which would otherwise be problematic for a Sticky Web-oriented team.</li> <li>Toxic Thread cripples opposing non-Poison-type Pokemon by dropping their Speed and inducing poison, which can help Smeargle avoid being shut down by Ground-types that are immune to Nuzzle and faster Taunt users.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>A Jolly nature with maximum Speed investment is mandatory for Smeargle to be as fast as it can be to effectively set up entry hazards.</li> <li>Maximum HP investment increases Smeargle's bulk. However, it's essentially useless due to Smeargle's frailty and vulnerability of getting OHKOed or 2HKOed by many Pokemon in the tier.</li> <li>Focus Sash guarantees Smeargle the opportunity to use one of its utility moves before fainting.</li> <li>Own Tempo prevents Smeargle from getting confused, which risks breaking its own Focus Sash.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Smeargle's only role is a suicide lead that helps its teammates by setting up Sticky Web.</li> <li>Generally, it is ideal for Smeargle to set up Sticky Web first and then deal with the opposing lead Pokemon. However, this is solely based on lead matchup. It is important to analyze the opposing lead Pokemon in determining the optimal play for Smeargle. For example, if the opposing lead Pokemon knows Taunt, Smeargle should use Nuzzle first to cripple the foe and then set up Sticky Web. If the opposing lead Pokemon has moves with secondary effects, such as flinch or burn, it is important to realize that those factors risk preventing Smeargle from setting Sticky Web.</li> <li>Smeargle should only be led if the opposing team does not have a lead that can directly deal with it. For example, opposing lead Excadrill can be problematic, as it is immune to Nuzzle and Toxic Thread, can spin Sticky Web away, and can break Smeargle's Focus Sash.</li> <li>Mega Gengar poses as a threat to Smeargle, as it can either use Taunt to prevent Sticky Web or use Substitute to prevent being paralyzed. Therefore, Smeargle must be used with the right predictions.</li> <li>If the opposing lead Pokemon is a setup user, Smeargle can get Sticky Web up first and then phaze it with Whirlwind.</li> <li>Against lead hazard removers, Smeargle can use Toxic Thread to lower their Speed and get Sticky Web set up while the foe is poisoned. This will pressure the foe into staying in against Smeargle to remove hazards, but it will lose out from poison in the long run.</li> <li>If Smeargle cannot set up Sticky Web due to lead matchup, it can help cripple the opposing lead Pokemon with its status moves.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Strong wallbreakers such as Swords Dance Mega Lucario, Swords Dance Rayquaza, and Calm Mind Primal Kyogre, which would otherwise struggle against offensive teams, can take advantage of Sticky Web by setting up.</li> <li>Since Smeargle's primary role is to set up Sticky Web, an offensive Stealth Rock setter like Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM ensures that the entry hazard can be set up more than once, as opposing bulky offense and balance teams will attempt to get rid of Sticky Web. This means that the opposing team's defensive core will be vulnerable to the offensive pressure of trying to remove Sticky Web and will concede with either Stealth Rock, Sticky Web, or both for the duration of the battle.</li> <li>Ultra Necrozma benefits from Sticky Web, as it can outspeed threats like Mega Gengar. Its pre-Ultra Burst form can be either Necrozma-DM or Necrozma-DW depending on team composition. Necrozma-DM is able to be an offensive threat with Swords Dance without transforming into Ultra Necrozma, and Necrozma-DW can spinblock prior to transforming.</li> <li>Offensive Fairy-types like Choice Specs Xerneas can deal with crippled Yveltal, Mega Salamence, and Marshadow. Arceus-Fairy can set up with Calm Mind and provides another option for a Stealth Rock setter.</li> <li>Mega Diancie is a great teammate for Smeargle, as Magic Bounce covers most Taunt leads for Smeargle. Mega Diancie also has access to Stealth Rock and Explosion to complement Smeargle's Sticky Web and punch a hole into offensive teams early.</li> <li>Smeargle can cripple opposing threats with Nuzzle, which can slow down faster threats like Choice Scarf Yveltal, Geomancy Xerneas, Marshadow, and Deoxys-A that teammates can check or counter more easily.</li> <li>Taunt users like Yveltal can prevent opposing teams from potentially undoing Smeargle's entry hazards with Defog.</li> <li>On the other hand, Ghost-types like Marshadow and Mega Gengar can block Rapid Spin from opposing Excadrill and Smeargle.</li> </ul> "

  "Blissey": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Blissey serves as a crucial defensive backbone on stall teams that can provide various utility options. Immense special bulk and Natural Cure combine to make Blissey an efficient check to various support Arceus formes, Xerneas, and other special attackers, which not many Pokemon on defensive teams are eager to consistently pivot into. Access to Heal Bell allows Blissey to further limit said foes' usefulness by curing its teammates of status and allowing them to outlast the opposing team.</li> <li>The most important reason to employ Blissey over Chansey on defensive teams is that Blissey has an option to entirely avoid Shadow Tag users and the uncommon Dugtrio by holding Shed Shell. This means Blissey will not significantly influence its team's structure like Chansey would and thus provide players with more options to choose its teammates instead of mandating certain partners like Pursuit trappers.</li> <li>While being able to avoid trapping makes Blissey more commonly chosen over Chansey, Blissey has less bulk in comparison to Chansey holding an Eviolite. This makes Blissey's matchup against certain Pokemon like Geomancy Xerneas and Calm Mind Primal Kyogre shakier to some degree, as Blissey risks getting 2HKOed by said foes after boosts, while Chansey can avoid this concern due to its better bulk. Chansey also has some resilience against physical attacks thanks to Eviolite, while Blissey suffers from its extreme vulnerability to practically every physical move, struggling to fit onto any archetype apart from stall. Blissey's almost nonexistent physical bulk also means that Pursuit users like Marshadow and Tyranitar can net heavy damage while forcing it out.</li> <li>Blissey suffers from its general passivity: the inability to do much damage to Pokemon that do not mind Toxic, the prevalence of Substitute users, and the ubiquity of overwhelming physical attackers in the tier contribute to Blissey being a momentum drain in many instances.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Leftovers may seem like an attractive item for Blissey to hold to alleviate it from entry hazard damage and weak attacks, but there are very few instances where the passive recovery outweighs the benefit of avoiding trappers.</li> <li>Ice Beam may be an interesting option to lure various offensive checks and punish them. Ice Beam has a chance to OHKO offensive Mega Salamence after Stealth Rock and prevents Naganadel and Substitute variants of Zygarde-C from setting up on Blissey, but with the exception of Naganadel, Blissey can at best hit them on the switch with Ice Beam and should never attempt to contend them one on one.</li> <li>Thunder Wave harshly punishes Necrozma-DM, Mega Lucario, Naganadel, and other Toxic-immune Pokemon.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Blissey is largely reliant on Toxic to damage its foes, which allows most Steel-types to freely take advantage of Blissey. While the likes of offensive Necrozma-DM and Mega Lucario have to be wary of getting worn down by Seismic Toss, other Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Magearna, and Celesteela can switch into Blissey with impunity due to their access to healing moves.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Toxapex does not mind Blissey at all due to its immunity to Toxic and resilience to Seismic Toss thanks to Recover and Regenerator, using Blissey as setup fodder for Toxic Spikes. Naganadel can freely use Blissey lacking Seismic Toss or the rare Ice Beam as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Blissey is typically shut down by Taunt and forced to use Struggle against Taunt users like Yveltal and Mewtwo due to it not carrying any attacks in most cases.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit: Marshadow and Tyranitar force out Blissey with their ability to threaten to OHKO it and can net significant damage with Pursuit. Choice Band Tyranitar can guarantee Blissey's removal, as a Choice Band-boosted Pursuit will 2HKO Blissey even if it decides to stay in against Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce: Mega Sableye completely shuts down Blissey with its presence, as it prevents Blissey from spreading Toxic and setting Stealth Rock. Mega Diancie limits Blissey's effectiveness for similar reasons and can offensively threaten Blissey with Diamond Storm.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attacks: Blissey must avoid taking any physical attacks by any means necessary, as many Pokemon in Ubers are capable of outright OHKOing Blissey with physical moves. For this reason, Blissey is entirely dependent on its teammates to handle very common Pokemon like Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Zygarde-C. Blissey's low Defense stat also limits its ability to check mixed special attackers like Deoxys-A. Mewtwo and Lunala can also bypass Blissey's special bulk with Psystrike and Psyshock, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon Resilient to Toxic: Opposing Blissey and Rest users like Giratina and defensive Zygarde-C prevent Blissey from spreading Toxic by consistently switching into it and absorbing status. However, most Pokemon that rely on Rest or cleric moves to overcome Toxic struggle doing much back to Blissey.</p> ",

If there are multiple foes on the opposing team that Blissey has to handle, prevent it from consuming too much PP from Soft-Boiled and keep it in a pristine condition to allow it to effectively pivot.</li> <li>Keeping the field clean of entry hazards with various Defog users alleviates pressure from Blissey as well. More durable defensive partners like Ho-Oh, Lugia, and support Arceus formes can pivot into certain special attackers to prevent Blissey from sustaining too much damage.</li> <li>While Blissey's sheer special bulk may make it seem like it can be an ironclad check for every special attacker in the tier, there are multiple foes that Blissey must not switch into before confirming the moveset. Various special attackers have methods to exploit Blissey's abysmal Defense, with examples of these including Yveltal with Knock Off, Lunala with Psyshock, and Primal Kyogre, which usually uses physical sets. Due to Blissey's passivity, it is unlikely that it will be given a safe chance to recover once it has been lured and heavily damaged. Have other teammates scout these foes first and determine if Blissey will be a better switch-in after analyzing their movesets.</li> <li>If there are foes like Z-Geomancy Xerneas and Calm Mind Arceus formes packing Refresh that can only be checked by Blissey, decide which foe Blissey will check with Confide; Confide does not have enough PP to keep up with more than one setup sweeper and wasting PP will lead to the likes of Arceus-Dark, Arceus-Flying, and Primal Kyogre having enough power to pressure Blissey to a harder degree. Confide's PP is identical to Calm Mind's PP, and it will have just enough PP to neuter Xerneas with Geomancy, so never waste it when a foe is unboosted.</li> <li>Blissey is also threatened by Pursuit users like Marshadow and Tyranitar, which can weaken it to the point where it can no longer safely switch into powerful special attackers it is obligated to check. There are not many ways to determine potential users of Pursuit, and this serves as another reason why Blissey shouldn't recklessly switch into attacks too early on.</li> <li>Note that being able to switch out of trappers doesn't give Blissey a reason to justify staying in against them. Mega Gengar and Gothitelle will carry Taunt to shut down Blissey, and Dugtrio will overpower Blissey with its attacks.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Blissey's most important partners on defensive teams are physically defensive Pokemon and entry hazard removers. Physical walls and Blissey can work together to check a significant portion of the tier, and Defog users prevent Blissey from getting overwhelmed by residual damage.</li> <li>Giratina boasts colossal physical bulk to check many foes that threaten Blissey, such as physical Primal Kyogre, and can provide Defog support. Its ability to spread status is especially helpful to Blissey if it forgoes Toxic for other utility moves. Giratina benefits from Blissey's Heal Bell and Wish, as they reduce Giratina's need to rely on Rest to stay healthy. Giratina's Pressure helps Blissey and its other teammates outlast the other team by limiting their PP. Mega Sableye, while not as durable as Giratina, can provide a different form of hazard control with Magic Bounce, which punishes passive Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Skarmory that attempt to take advantage of Blissey. It can check certain physical attackers like Marshadow and Extreme Killer Arceus and punish various Steel-types with Will-O-Wisp. Mega Sableye's ability to check Mega Mewtwo Y is also noteworthy, as Blissey cannot stand against it due to Psystrike. Both Giratina and Mega Sableye can switch into Fighting-type attacks for Blissey and appreciate it checking Xerneas and many special attackers.</li> <li>Support Arceus formes and Ho-Oh can also check certain physical attackers and provide Defog support. Various Arceus formes have an option to invest defensively to blanket check Marshadow and function as better checks to Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Mega Salamence. The likes of Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Ground can serve as good checks to Necrozma-DM, which harshly punishes Blissey after it takes away momentum. Arceus-Dark's ability to prevail against Shadow Tag trapping and check Yveltal, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Ultra Necrozma is especially notable, as defensive teams do not have many ways to counteract them. Their effectiveness as a pivot is generally improved with Blissey's Heal Bell and Wish. Ho-Oh can pivot into various support Arceus formes without worrying too much about status or taking heavy damage thanks to Regenerator and can spread various status, and this enables Blissey to opt for a different utility move over Toxic. In an the event where Blissey has to conserve its PP for Soft-Boiled and Heal Bell, Ho-Oh can pivot into support Arceus formes and Xerneas.</li> <li>Primal Groudon can benefit from Heal Bell and Wish and can make up for Blissey's complete passivity with its offensive presence and access to Stealth Rock. Its ability to be a check to Xerneas and Primal Kyogre is notable as well, as Blissey isn't too much of a consistent check to them.</li> <li>Lugia can check various setup sweepers thanks to Multiscale and can phaze them in a pinch. Lugia also enjoys Blissey's cleric support and ability to pivot into support Arceus formes, which will typically attempt to cripple Lugia with Toxic.</li> <li>Entry hazards can prevent Steel-types from liberally switching into Blissey. While Blissey can run Stealth Rock of its own, its poor matchup against other entry hazard users make them considerable in many instances. Ferrothorn simultaneously checks Primal Kyogre and sets Spikes, which quickly wears down Steel-types like Necrozma-DM. Skarmory can set the same entry hazards and, unlike Ferrothorn, serves as a solid check to Necrozma-DM, Mega Salamence, and the majority of physical attackers and has an option to avoid trapping by holding Shed Shell. Toxapex checks Fighting-types like Marshadow and Mega Lucario and can set Toxic Spikes to significantly reduce grounded foes' longevity.</li> <li>Giratina-O benefits from cleric and Wish support as well, differentiating itself from Giratina with its better offensive presence. It serves as a more reliable check to Primal Groudon and provides Defog support.</li> <li>Despite Blissey's lack of concern towards Shadow Tag users, Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar and Alolan Muk can be used to remove Mega Gengar for other teammates that may be vulnerable to trapping and handle troublesome attackers like Lunala, Deoxys-A, and Mega Mewtwo Y. These Pokemon can provide other utility options apart from trapping: Tyranitar can provide Stealth Rock support and check Flying-types like Yveltal and Ho-Oh, which defensive teams lack consistent switch-ins to. Alolan Muk can spread poison with Poison Touch and remove other passive Pokemon's Leftovers to reduce their longevity.</li> </ul> "

  "Tyranitar": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>While Tyranitar has an underwhelming matchup against common threats like Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, Zygarde-C, and Xerneas, its unique typing leaves it with a number of notable attributes that justify its place on some teams.</li> <li>Tyranitar's good bulk, defensive typing of Rock / Dark, and Sand Steam that further improves its special bulk make it one of the few Pokemon that can pivot into dangerous attackers like Yveltal, Lunala, and Mega Mewtwo Y lacking Focus Blast. Tyranitar's decent offensive typing, wide movepool, and offensive stats also contribute to its offensive presence, making it a decent wallbreaker when equipped with Choice Band.</li> <li>One of the most important aspects of using Tyranitar is its ability to guarantee the removal of Ghost- and Psychic-types with Pursuit in addition to defensively checking them. This can prove to be very valuable for some balanced teams that want troublesome foes like Mega Mewtwo Y and Giratina-O disposed of and defensive teams that have trouble facing Mega Gengar and Gothitelle.</li> <li>Despite these rare traits, Tyranitar's low Speed, many common weaknesses, and vulnerability to residual damage when lacking Rest undermine its overall effectiveness, forcing it out against a massive portion of the tier and limiting its ability to be a switch-in to threats it will have to check. Said downsides cause further problems to Tyranitar's team due to Tyranitar leaving its team open to threatening foes that it invites after trapping a foe with Pursuit.</li> <li>Tyranitar has a myriad of utility options like Stealth Rock and coverage move options available in its arsenal, but even when it is performing a specialized role, it tends to lack moveslots to fit all necessary moves. The majority of its sets are checked by Steel-types, and others lacking Toxic have little chance against Arceus formes with a type advantage.</li> <li>All of these combine to make Tyranitar somewhat inconsistent due to a high demand of proper predictions and fluctuating performances depending on matchups. However, Tyranitar's many mentioned unique traits allow it to support or synergize with many common Pokemon in the tier and compress valuable roles, such as setting Stealth Rock in place of Primal Groudon, pivoting into Yveltal in place of Xerneas, and drawing in bulky Pokemon and punishing them with unsuspected powerful attacks or status moves.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Utility Tyranitar has various attacks it can choose to deal with certain foes. Fire Blast punishes Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, Low Kick 2HKOes Arceus-Dark, Extreme Killer Arceus, Ferrothorn, and Dialga, and Taunt can be used with 76 Speed EVs to shut down Skarmory and other slower walls while preventing a healthy Gothitelle from neutralizing it. Crunch allows Tyranitar to anti-lead Deoxys-S and OHKOes Lunala and Mega Mewtwo Y, which Tyranitar will otherwise only damage with Pursuit after surviving a Focus Blast with Chople Berry. However, these moves come with the cost of Tyranitar having to forgo Stealth Rock or other crucial attacks that can cover more important threats it is usually obliged to handle.</li> <li>Roar is an option to consider, as this enables Tyranitar from getting set up on by anything when it is no longer needed and can potentially make Geomancy Xerneas waste its Power Herb, but this also hinders Tyranitar's role compression.</li> <li>Mega Tyranitar can be run on certain teams that do not have any other Pokemon holding a Mega Stone. Mega Tyranitar is a much more durable check to Yveltal and Ho-Oh, but its offensive capabilities are outclassed by Choice Band sets, while its usefulness as a trapper is inferior to regular Tyranitar holding a Lum Berry. Dragon Dance set may seem usable, but it has extreme difficulty sweeping balanced and defensive teams and faces competition with other Dragon Dance users like Zygarde-C and Mega Gyarados.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Ground-types are the most common foes that can freely take advantage of Tyranitar once they switch in while avoiding Toxic. The very common Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground can force out Tyranitar and proceed to hit the switch-in hard or set up, while Zygarde can set up on Tyranitar lacking Ice Beam without concern after setting Substitute. However, all of these Pokemon must be wary about taking too much damage from Choice Band sets.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types pose problems to Tyranitar due to their ability to offensively check it. Though Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy take heavy damage from Choice Band-boosted Stone Edge and are quickly worn down by Toxic and sandstorm damage, they can otherwise force out Tyranitar and use their utility options. Xerneas can hinder utility Tyranitar's usefulness with Aromatherapy and Defog, and Arceus-Fairy can set Stealth Rock of its own as it forces Tyranitar to switch. Magearna can pivot into Choice Band Tyranitar depending on what coverage move it has opted for and what move it is locked into.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-types like Marshadow and Mega Lucario can easily force out Tyranitar and proceed to damage the switch-in. The fact that Marshadow has limited checks means Tyranitar will often end up burdening its teammates should it hand away momentum to it. Mega Lucario can easily set up on any variant of Tyranitar lacking Earthquake or Superpower.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: While they have to pivot into Choice Band Tyranitar with caution, Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Celesteela can easily switch into utility Tyranitar and can spread status or annoy switch-ins with Leech Seed or Spikes. Necrozma-DM can threaten to OHKO Choice Band Tyranitar, but it must be an offensive variant to net an OHKO and it will be punished by Foul Play should it be taking on utility Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Moves: Despite Tyranitar's solid bulk under sandstorm, its effectiveness as a defensive pivot to resisted attackers tends to get undermined by coverage moves like Earthquake and Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce</strong>: Choice Band Tyranitar can overpower Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie, but utility variants are easily shut down by them and are discouraged from setting Stealth Rock or spreading Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Although both Primal Kyogre and Arceus-Water dislike switching into Choice Band Tyranitar and getting inflicted by Toxic, they can otherwise force out Tyranitar with their STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Status: Toxic reduces Tyranitar's longevity, limiting its ability to pivot into resisted attacks. Burn can be detrimental to Tyranitar lacking Lum Berry, as this can prevent it from removing a threat with Pursuit.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>A Choice Band-boosted Stone Edge is notoriously difficult to safely switch into due to the small number of targets that resist it and can avoid getting punished by other attacks. Apart from heavily threatening Flying-types like Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Mega Salamence, Stone Edge can net a 2HKO on bulky foes like Primal Groudon and force recovery moves from maximum HP support Arceus formes while putting a significant dent in Xerneas and having a high chance to OHKO Primal Kyogre after Stealth Rock damage. The damage output is also considerably threatening against defensive teams, as Pokemon like Arceus-Dark, Toxapex, and Skarmory are prone to getting 2HKOed after slight prior damage.</li> <li>Crunch has good coverage against a large portion of the tier with Stone Edge. Despite its slightly lower damage output, Crunch serves as the best way to hit common foes like Necrozma-DM and Giratina-O and is strong enough to do a good chunk of damage to resistant targets like Xerneas with sandstorm damage and force a recovery move from Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>Pursuit enables Tyranitar to net heavy damage on a target switching out, typically removing retreating Ghost- and Psychic-types from play. With Choice Band, Pursuit can also net good damage on neutral targets that attempt to avoid an unfavorable matchup against Tyranitar, guaranteeing a 2HKO on Blissey and OHKO on retreating Mega Gengar after getting burned.</li> <li>Superpower rounds out Tyranitar's coverage by hitting Steel-types hard. With Choice Band, Superpower can guarantee OHKO Ferrothorn and Dialga with minimal prior damage, threaten to OHKO maximum HP Arceus-Dark, and put a major dent on Magearna. It also immediately removes Chansey after Stealth Rock damage and harshly punishes Mega Lucario, should it attempt to switch into Tyranitar and set up on it.</li> <li>Ice Punch OHKOes offensive untransformed Zygarde and 2HKOes defensive Zygarde-C and Arceus-Ground. Ice Punch is also reliable against Flying-types like Mega Salamence and Rayquaza if missing Stone Edge against them will be a huge detriment. Note that forgoing Superpower for Ice Punch makes Magearna a reliable switch-in to this set.</li> <li>Earthquake provides Tyranitar with a stronger coverage option against Magearna and has the highest damage output against Primal Groudon. Superpower's main targets typically outweigh Earthquake's broad range of coverage, however.</li> <li>Persistent switch-ins like Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Ground can be crippled by Toxic, but this makes Tyranitar ineffective against Steel-types and getting locked into Toxic is not very ideal.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>28 Defense EVs allow Tyranitar to survive defensive Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike from full health, letting Tyranitar 2HKO it with Crunch. Maximum Speed EVs enable Tyranitar to outspeed uninvested base 90 Speed Pokemon, letting it KO foes like Giratina formes first and pick off weakened threats like defensive Primal Groudon.</li> <li>The rest of the EVs are invested in Attack with Adamant nature to give Tyranitar enough power to 2HKO many neutral targets, such as support Arceus formes and offensive Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Choice Band allows Tyranitar to take advantage of its decent Attack, good STAB combination, and many coverage moves to net heavy damage on many of its switch-ins.</li> <li>Sand Stream summons sandstorm when Tyranitar switches in, increasing Tyranitar's special bulk. Damage from sandstorm can also be beneficial with turning potential KOs into guaranteed KOs.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Tyranitar can seek opportunities to come into the field by utilizing its nifty resistances to Dark and Ghost and immunity to Psychic. While Tyranitar's massive special bulk with sandstorm lets it easily take resisted attacks multiple times, this set must exercise some caution when pivoting into threats like Yveltal, Gengar, and Mega Mewtwo Y.</li> <li>Some variants of Yveltal can wear down Tyranitar with U-turn and proceed to create unfavorable matchups, and others can threaten it with Focus Blast.</li> <li>While it is also possible for Tyranitar to switch into a foe that cannot immediately threaten it, note that a number of Pokemon it can threaten can status it on the switch. This means Tyranitar may risk getting burned by Mega Gengar and Giratina-O's Will-O-Wisp and being put on a timer by Blissey's Toxic on the switch.</li> <li>Switching into Ho-Oh also involves a risk due to Toxic and a potential burn from Sacred Fire. Though Mega Gengar will still be taken out by burned Tyranitar and Blissey will be 2HKOed by Pursuit, Tyranitar will be much less effective when inflicted with burn or poison. Only take this risk against the aforementioned threats if there will be ample opportunities for a teammate to provide cleric support or weakening or removing such foes outweighs having Tyranitar afflicted by status.</li> <li>Though sandstorm can easily be removed by Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre, it can be handy with helping wearing down Tyranitar's switch-ins and improving Tyranitar's bulk to the point where it can take resisted hits multiple times even without defensive investment. Using sandstorm damage, Tyranitar can also limit suicide leads like Cloyster, Smeargle, and Deoxys-S to a single turn and pivot into Lunala to take any attack other than Focus Blast and break Shadow Shield, making it easier to deal with for teammates.</li> <li>Ideally, Choice Band Tyranitar will net as much damage as possible on offensive checks it draws in and be a solid pivot. Accomplishing both of these will be difficult due to Tyranitar's low Speed and its disadvantageous matchup against a myriad of common threats in the tier, forcing it to rely on a hit-and-run playstyle. Avoid being too reckless with switching in Tyranitar when reacting to offensive threats to the point where Tyranitar becomes too predictable. Almost every competitive team has a few Pokemon that can take advantage of Tyranitar if they have double switched in safely.</li> <li>Tyranitar will have more opportunities to dish out damage against slower and defensive teams. There may be problematic foes like support Arceus formes that can check Tyranitar, but an appropriate attack boosted by Choice Band is strong enough to force recovery from many defensive checks. Tyranitar can also KO or weaken Pokemon like Giratina formes and Blissey that attempt to avoid an unfavorable matchup and 2HKO bulky Pokemon like Skarmory and Toxapex with entry hazard support, so fully take advantage of its wallbreaking capabilities in such a matchup. Note that Tyranitar's bulk is also helpful for 2HKOing support Arceus formes on the switch after easily surviving a super effective Judgment.</li> <li>Trapping a threat with Pursuit can be a good decision even against foes that resist it. For example, an opponent with Yveltal will aim to wear down Tyranitar with repeated attacks if there are no other reliable checks available to the team. If Tyranitar successfully switched into an Yveltal that does not have a way to significantly threaten it, it can force the switch and do heavy damage with Pursuit. Factoring in sandstorm, Dark Aura, and Choice Band, Pursuit is strong enough to prevent Yveltal from switching into most attacks afterwards.</li> <li>Gothitelle will be a difficult foe to trap and even when Tyranitar successfully double switched into it, as Tyranitar will have to predict well to avoid getting locked into Pursuit as Gothitelle neutralizes it with Charm. Attempting to get Tyranitar in against Gothitelle is already risky considering how many Pokemon can threaten Tyranitar in a one-on-one situation, so do not aggressively attempt to trap it unless its removal is crucial for the team.</li> <li>Note that Pursuit trapping involves a risk. A Tyranitar locked into Pursuit is very exploitable and invites Pokemon like Primal Groudon, Zygarde, Xerneas, Marshadow, and Primal Kyogre, which can be dangerous when freely given momentum. Only trap threats when it is absolutely needed and be prepared to deal with a threat that will exploit Tyranitar locked into Pursuit.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Tyranitar can synergize with various common Pokemon in the tier that benefit from Tyranitar's ability to weaken many Pokemon and remove problematic foes like Mega Gengar, Giratina-O, and Mega Mewtwo Y. On the flipside, Tyranitar also has numerous weaknesses due to its lacking defensive typing, which is worsened by it becoming more exploitable after getting locked into Pursuit, and these have to be properly covered by durable defensive cores or offensive pressure from teammates that will prevent or check many forms of setup.</li> <li>Xerneas is one of the best offensive partners to be considered. Choice Scarf variants can provide great revenge killing utility against Marshadow and Ultra Necrozma, use Defog and Aromatherapy to improve Tyranitar's longevity, and benefit from the removal of Mega Gengar and Blissey. Depending on Tyranitar's coverage move, Steel-types like Magearna can be heavily damaged and left vulnerable to Geomancy Xerneas as well.</li> <li>Primal Groudon can threaten a myriad of Fairy- and Steel-types that will exploit Tyranitar lacking a proper coverage move to hit them or locked into a wrong move. Primal Groudon is also valuable for its ability to set Stealth Rock, check Xerneas and Primal Kyogre, and take advantage of Magearna. In return, Tyranitar removes Giratina-O and threatens Ho-Oh. Necrozma-DM can be useful for similar reasons, and offensive sets can have a better chance to break through the opposing team after Tyranitar weakened Primal Groudon and Steel-types.</li> <li>Mega Salamence can check Ground- and Fighting-types that take advantage of Tyranitar and pivot into Primal Groudon and Mega Lucario. All variants appreciate Tyranitar weakening Steel- and Fairy-types and potentially removing Zygarde by luring it and punishing it with Ice Punch.</li> <li>Other checks to Ground-types and Primal Groudon, such as support Arceus formes, Primal Kyogre, and Ho-Oh, all are options depending on the structure of the team. Support Arceus formes easily fit with Tyranitar and enjoy Tyranitar removing Blissey and Ferrothorn with appropriate attacks. Primal Kyogre can wear down Primal Groudon, checks Arceus-Ground, and pressure opposing support Arceus formes relatively well. Ho-Oh may be harder to fit, but it checks many support Arceus formes better, can handle certain variants of Primal Groudon, and can have Tyranitar deal with Mega Salamence, KO a lured Zygarde with Ice Punch, and threaten other Steel-types in return, as Tyranitar that forgoes other moves for Ice Punch will struggle against them.</li> <li>Toxapex can check many Fighting-types that tend to set up on Tyranitar, provide Toxic Spikes support, pivot into Toxic, and benefit from Tyranitar pressuring Mega Sableye and trapping Mega Gengar.</li> <li>Arceus-Grass is a niche yet effective partner thanks to its ability to threaten offensive teams with its various coverage options, check Zygarde, Primal Kyogre, and Arceus-Ground, and weaken Steel-types with Fire Blast should Tyranitar not have the right move to deal with them. Tyranitar makes a good pivot to Flying-types and can eliminate Mega Gengar and Gothitelle.</li> </ul> "

        "name": "Utility",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Pursuit allows Tyranitar to trap prominent threats like Mega Gengar and Mega Mewtwo Y while preventing weakened or sleeping Gothitelle from causing further damage to the team after it trapped and neutralized one of Tyranitar's teammates. Note that this set will lack sufficient power to immediately remove Giratina-O and will fail to guarantee Mega Gengar's removal after getting burned by Will-O-Wisp if not holding Lum Berry.</li> <li>Rock Tomb allows Tyranitar to slow down switch-ins, potentially allowing its teammates to deal with them better. It also improves Tyranitar's effectiveness as a check to Arceus-Dark and bulky Arceus-Flying, both of which can potentially set up on this set.</li> <li>Rock Slide provides Tyranitar an alternative countermeasure against Flying-types it checks, letting it threaten to OHKO Ho-Oh and take out offensive Yveltal and Rayquaza after Stealth Rock damage.</li> <li>Foul Play can assist in alleviating this set's passivity by harshly punishing threats like Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM that attempt to use Tyranitar as setup fodder. If Tyranitar is wielding Shuca or Chople Berry, Foul Play also allows it to better check Earthquake Ultra Necrozma, Lunala, and Mega Mewtwo Y, OHKOing Lunala with its Shadow Shield broken and taking out Mega Mewtwo Y after Stealth Rock damage. Note that this variant of Tyranitar can survive a Sunsteel Strike from Adamant Necrozma-DM and punish it with Foul Play, and Extreme Killer Arceus is hit much harder by Foul Play if it has Swords Dance boosts.</li> <li>Ice Beam allows Tyranitar to dispose of Mega Salamence quicker and hit Zygarde harder. Against Giratina-O with Will-O-Wisp, this move is the best attack to use. However, it is important to note that forgoing Rock Slide for this move means that Tyranitar will rely on Toxic and sandstorm damage to check Yveltal, will be set up on Extreme Killer Arceus using Substitute, and will no longer check Ho-Oh effectively.</li> <li>Earthquake is a niche option to consider to offensively check Naganadel, hit Primal Groudon hard, and OHKO Lucario on the switch.</li> <li>Toxic improves Tyranitar's otherwise disappointing matchup against Xerneas and support Arceus formes by putting them on a timer as they switch in and wearing them down quickly in conjunction with sandstorm damage. It also punishes other offensive checks like Primal Groudon and Zygarde on the switch.</li> <li>Thunder Wave's ability to slow down a threat and annoy Steel-types makes it a good status move as well, but Toxic generally proves to be a better way to punish the likes of support Arceus forms in the long run.</li> <li>To pressure Mega Salamence and Ho-Oh and benefit teammates like Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM, Tyranitar can possibly run Stealth Rock to compress a role of pivot and entry hazard setter, though its worsened passivity can be detrimental.</li> <li>Rest is Tyranitar's only option of recovery that can fully restore its health and remove status, but it is going to be inefficient without cleric support due to Tyranitar being left vulnerable for two turns.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>The given EV spread with an Adamant nature allows Tyranitar to survive two +1 Double-Edges from Adamant Mega Salamence, take +1 Focus Blast from Lunala after Stealth Rock with Chople Berry intact, and threaten a good number of Flying-types with Rock Slide. Defensive Ho-Oh is almost always taken out by Rock Slide after sandstorm damage, Mega Salamence and maximum HP Arceus-Flying are 2HKOed with Stealth Rock on the field, and offensive Yveltal and Rayquaza are OHKOed after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>36 Speed EVs enable Tyranitar to outspeed Gothitelle, letting it pick off weakened ones without getting afflicted by Charm. A Brave nature with no investment in Speed should be used when running Ice Beam.</li> <li>Lum Berry is used to avoid getting burned by Mega Gengar's Will-O-Wisp once and ensure it is removed from play. It also has a situational use in making Tyranitar a better switch-in to the rare Darkrai.</li> <li>Chople Berry can be used to allow Tyranitar to survive a Focus Blast from threats like Mega Gengar, Lunala, and Mega Mewtwo Y. Assuming Tyranitar has switched into a different move, it will at least be able to survive said attack and retaliate to net heavy damage before it goes down.</li> <li>Shuca Berry is an option when Tyranitar is running Ice Beam to survive a boosted Thousand Arrows from Zygarde and KO back. Shuca Berry can also prove to be helpful with surviving a boosted Earthquake from Mega Salamence and Rayquaza.</li> <li>Leftovers can be used to provide Tyranitar with passive recovery and make it more resilient to weaker attacks and entry hazard damage.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>With bulkier investment, this variant of Tyranitar can switch into resisted attacks more freely. Once given a switch, Tyranitar will be given a turn to use one of its utility options before it is forced out by an incoming offensive threat. Setting Stealth Rock is mostly an ideal decision, as this will start wearing down the opposing team and help to identify a Defog user, which Tyranitar will aim to cripple with Toxic.</li> <li>Unless there is no other Pokemon that can do so, be wary of switching into super effective attacks from foes that Tyranitar will normally check. Even with Chople Berry intact, Tyranitar can be 2HKOed on the switch by Focus Blast from Lunala and Mega Mewtwo Y. If a foe that Tyranitar is tasked to take on can beat it one-on-one, aim to put it on a timer with Toxic or at least land an attack before Tyranitar is KOed.</li> <li>Dangerous threats like Mega Gengar, Lunala, and Mega Mewtwo Y should be disposed of if given a chance to do so. An opponent will switch in an offensive check afterwards, and if Tyranitar is no longer needed, set Stealth Rock or put a foe on timer with Toxic before it is KOed. However, against threats like Zygarde and Arceus-Ground that can use Tyranitar as setup fodder behind Substitute, be quick to switch out to a check or at least prevent them from getting excessive boosts with Ice Beam.</li> <li>Tyranitar cannot trap a healthy Gothitelle, as it is bulky enough to survive Pursuit a few times and neutralize Tyranitar. The best moment to use Tyranitar to ensure its removal is when it is asleep after using Rest or has been sufficiently worn down after trapping a teammate.</li> <li>Depending on what coverage move Tyranitar carries, it may land a surprise blow on threats like Necrozma-DM and Mega Lucario that assume Tyranitar is too passive to prevent them from setting up. If Tyranitar has already trapped a foe or does not check anything in particular, take a risk to prevent said foes from becoming too threatening.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Some balanced teams can still benefit from this variant of Tyranitar, as the ability to compress the roles of a status user, a Flying-type check, a Pursuit trapper, and possibly a Stealth Rock setter is nearly exclusive to it. Due to this set's lack of offensive presence, it will demand stronger security to Fairy-, Fighting-, and Ground-types, as they will freely take advantage of Tyranitar after it Pursuit trapped a foe or set Stealth Rock on the switch.</li> <li>Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM can benefit from Tyranitar pivoting into Yveltal, crippling support Arceus formes, and potentially allowing them to run varying sets by running Stealth Rock, and they patch up Tyranitar's defensive flaws in return. Both of them are secure checks to Xerneas and can viably run many countermeasures to threaten defensive Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Celesteela and threaten defensive teams with Mega Sableye, which Tyranitar struggles to do much against.</li> <li>Mega Salamence appreciates having a Stealth Rock setter and a teammate that can cripple support Arceus formes. In return, it can take advantage of said utility to sweep with Dragon Dance or be a better check to Primal Groudon by opting for other moves like Defog.</li> <li>Xerneas can revenge kill various Fighting-types with a Choice Scarf set, cure Tyranitar of its status with Aromatherapy, and benefit from Tyranitar removing Mega Gengar and keeping Ho-Oh at bay with Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Offensive checks to Ground-types like Primal Kyogre and Arceus-Grass can pressure threats like Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground, and this form of offensive pressure is needed due to Tyranitar lacking enough offensive presence by itself.</li> <li>Various support Arceus formes can fit alongside Tyranitar depending on what weakness has to be patched up with the rest of the team. They can also opt for sets with Special Attack investment to help against teams with Mega Sableye by setting Stealth Rock against them.</li> <li>As this set can guarantee Mega Gengar's removal with Lum Berry assuming Mega Gengar lacks Focus Blast, various Pokemon commonly employed in defensive teams can benefit from Tyranitar. Primary examples of these include Chansey that checks Fairy-types and provides cleric support, Ferrothorn that checks Primal Kyogre, takes advantage of support Arceus formes, and sets Spikes, and Skarmory that can check certain Ground-types and also provide Spikes support.</li> </ul> "

    "overview": "<ul> <li>The combination of Lugia's colossal bulk and Multiscale makes it one of the most durable walls in the tier and lets it function as an essential defensive backbone for many defensive teams.</li> <li>What allows Lugia to check an incredible portion of the tier and reliably shut down many boosted sweepers is Multiscale; it boosts Lugia's already strong defensive capabilities to the point where Lugia is nigh impossible to OHKO without breaking its Multiscale beforehand and forces foes to set Stealth Rock or status Lugia before attempting to make a breakthrough.</li> <li>Immunity to Ground also contributes to Lugia's effectiveness as a wall, as it allows Lugia to check some of the notable threats to defensive teams like Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>Lugia's high Speed as a wall is another advantage for a defensive Pokemon, as this allows Lugia to reliably stall out Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and other slower threats.</li> <li>It should be noted that whether Lugia successfully checks foes or not is almost entirely dependent on whether or not Multiscale is intact due to its somewhat disappointing defensive typing. This means Lugia requires strong entry hazard removal support from its teammates and cleric support to prevent burn and poison from invalidating Multiscale, so it thus struggles to fit in archetypes other than stall.</li> <li>Inability to do much against Necrozma-DM is one of Lugia's worst downsides; many Necrozma-DM sets are capable of breaking through Multiscale with Sunsteel Strike, do not mind Toxic or any attack that Lugia commonly carries, and can hinder Lugia's usefulness with Toxic and Stealth Rock. The fact that defensive teams have somewhat narrow defensive counterplay against Necrozma-DM further concerns players when attempting to bring Lugia into play.</li> <li>Lugia's passivity leaves it unable to pose a threat to almost every Pokemon immune to Toxic, resulting in it being easily taken advantage of by Steel-types like Necrozma-DM and vulnerable to Mega Gengar. Substitute users like Zygarde-C and Arceus-Ground also prove to be serious issues, as Lugia can no longer check them should they be the last Pokemon remaining.</li> <li>While carrying Psychic or Ice Beam can remedy these issues, Lugia's passivity still restricts the number of teams it can justify a spot on.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Lugia's ability to withstand many attacks and contend against Primal Groudon may make it seem like a viable Defog user, but its horrendous matchup against Steel-type entry hazard setters like Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory leaves this option completely outclassed by Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Both Whirlwind and Dragon Tail can be run for Lugia to better deal with Shadow Tag users and retain its ability to deal with Substitute users, but forgoing Psychic or Ice Beam isn't ideal.</li> <li>Aeroblast is a slightly more powerful STAB move than Psychic that has a better chance to 2HKO Mega Lucario and is the best attack against Marshadow and Mega Mewtwo X, but it cannot 2HKO Mega Gengar and leaves Lugia unable to threaten Toxapex.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Necrozma-DM</strong>: Necrozma-DM is one of the worst Steel-types to face for Lugia, as it can hit through Lugia's Multiscale with Sunsteel Strike or Searing Sunraze Smash and takes minuscule damage from any attacks. Defensive variants do not mind Lugia at all and can proceed to set Stealth Rock or cripple Lugia with Toxic. Lugia's attempt to gradually wear down Necrozma-DM will fail if Necrozma-DM packs Morning Sun. Lugia is therefore almost completely dependent on its teammates to handle any variant of Necrozma-DM.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Lugia's lack of offensive presence and reliance on Toxic to inflict meaningful damage make most Steel-types nuisances for its effectiveness. Various Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor can switch into Lugia with impunity and proceed to utilize their support options. It should also be noted that most relevant Steel-types carry Toxic or entry hazard moves, which further concerns Lugia.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce: Both Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie bounce back Toxic and cannot be phazed due to Magic Bounce. Mega Sableye is only slightly annoyed by Dragon Tail, which still does pitiful damage, and Mega Diancie can set Stealth Rock against Lugia or threaten it with Diamond Storm.</p> <p><strong>Dark- and Ghost-types: Dark-types like Yveltal and Arceus-Dark and Ghost-types like Marshadow and Lunala can hit Lugia super effectively and bypass its sheer bulk. While none of them except Lunala are capable of OHKOing Lugia with Multiscale intact, they are still capable of weakening Lugia to the point where it can no longer freely pivot into foes.</p> <p><strong>Shadow Tag: Mega Gengar can trap Lugia lacking Dragon Tail and proceed to remove it after Taunt, but it must be wary of Psychic. Gothitelle easily traps and neutralizes any Lugia lacking Dragon Tail.</p> <p><strong>Status: Both poison and burn invalidate Lugia's Multiscale with residual damage, and paralysis reduces Lugia's ability to reliably keep itself healthy with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Foes that Cannot be Phazed</strong>: Dragon Dance Zygarde discourages Lugia from using Toxic by setting up behind Substitute and phazes Lugia with Dragon Tail before Lugia can phaze it. Z-Geomancy Xerneas can set up on Lugia after Ingrain. Substitute users like Arceus-Ground and Toxic-immune setup sweepers like Mega Lucario can freely set up on Lugia if they remain as the last Pokemon and if Lugia does not have a way to break Substitute.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Roost functions as a reliable form of recovery, and it is chosen over Recover in order to more easily stall out foes with Electric-, Ice-, and Rock-type moves. Examples of Roost's benefits can be seen against threats like Stone Edge Primal Groudon and Thunder Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>Lugia's massive bulk allows it to easily stall foes with Toxic.</li> <li>Whirlwind removes a foe from the field, letting Lugia shut down a setup sweeper that it can't stall out reliably. Whirlwind also has benefits of phazing foes behind Substitute.</li> <li>Dragon Tail is an alternative phazing move that does minor damage and can be handy against Shadow Tag users like Mega Gengar and Gothitelle, but using Dragon Tail leaves Lugia unable to properly check Substitute users, and it has a slight chance to miss. Dragon Tail is also unable to phaze Geomancy Xerneas.</li> <li>Psychic targets certain foes that Lugia cannot effectively stall out with Toxic. It harshly punishes Mega Gengar, having a chance to outright OHKO its regular forme if switched in when Stealth Rock is up. Psychic also has the benefits of 2HKOing Mega Lucario and Toxapex after some prior damage and heavily damaging Marshadow and Mega Blaziken.</li> <li>Ice Beam allows Lugia to take more offensive approaches to checking Dragon-types. Both Mega Salamence and Rayquaza are OHKOed by Ice Beam after Stealth Rock damage, and the former can still be taken out by Ice Beam after taking damage from Double-Edge's recoil. It should be noted that Lugia is able to check Zygarde-C with Ice Beam, which would otherwise freely set up on Lugia with Substitute up to block Toxic and sponge Psychic while phazing Lugia with Dragon Tail.</li> <li>Substitute eases Lugia's attempt to stall slower foes and blocks status. Substitute also serves as Lugia's only way to prevent the loss of momentum against Necrozma-DM, as Necrozma-DM is forced to use Sunsteel Strike against Lugia behind Substitute and will be discouraged to use Lugia as setup fodder.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum HP investment makes Lugia's HP divisible by 16, letting it take full advantage of Leftovers recovery. 96 Speed EVs allow Lugia to outspeed neutral-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon and move first against threats like Swords Dance Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre. 136 EVs can be run to outspeed Dragon Dance variants of regular Zygarde and let Lugia use Toxic on them before they set up a Substitute.</li> <li>The remainder of the EVs are invested in Defense with a Bold nature to maximize Lugia's physical bulk, giving it a good chance to survive attacks like +2 Stone Edge from Arceus-Ground, +1 Double-Edge from Mega Salamence, and +2 Shadow Claw from Extreme Killer Arceus after Stealth Rock damage.</li> <li>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment with a Calm nature improves Lugia's special bulk to the point where it can check Geomancy Xerneas after taking Stealth Rock damage and even avoid the 2HKO from Mega Gengar. However, this option is generally unreliable and Lugia typically prefers physically defensive investment to better check foes it commonly pivots into.</li> <li>Leftovers provides Lugia with passive recovery.</li> <li>Multiscale halves damage from attacks when Lugia is at full HP, but you should note that moves like Sunsteel Strike and Moongeist Beam and abilities like Mold Breaker, Teravolt, and Turboblaze can bypass this.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Lugia's role is fairly straightforward. After threats like Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground are revealed to be offensive variants, Lugia can be switched into them liberally to simply wall them and stall them with Toxic. Boosted threats can be phazed with Whirlwind or dealt with by Psychic or Ice Beam depending on the foe. That said, several conditions must be fulfilled in order for Lugia to effectively and consistently check offensive threats.</li> <li>Avoid any status ailments. Both poison and burn will invalidate Multiscale, while paralysis significantly diminishes Lugia's ability to check foes like Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre, as they will strike Lugia first if it is paralyzed. Avoiding status moves will not be easy, however, as many Arceus formes carry Toxic and so do a majority of Primal Groudon variants. Statused Lugia should be cured as soon as possible if a Pokemon with a cleric move is given a chance.</li> <li>Keep Stealth Rock away from the field by any means necessary. Lugia's effectiveness as a wall depends on whether its Multiscale is intact or not, and Stealth Rock is worse than other factors that cripple Multiscale due to Lugia's weakness to said entry hazard. Be quick to identify and pressure Stealth Rock users like Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground from the opposing team, eliminating them if possible. As entry hazard users have to be out of play for Lugia to have breathing room, even trading Toxic with Lugia against Stealth Rock setters may be a worthwhile decision if Lugia's team has cleric support. If Stealth Rock is set, have a teammate like Giratina-O or Arceus-Dark swiftly remove it from the field so Lugia can face setup sweepers with Multiscale intact and thus maximize its chance to reliably check them before they proceed to threaten Lugia's team.</li> <li>Do not attempt to stall every foe with Toxic. As Lugia switches into foes, there is a considerable chance that the likes of Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Mega Lucario will set up. As Lugia can only handle the first hit with Multiscale, boosted foes should be promptly phazed with Whirlwind or Dragon Tail before they overpower Lugia with a second attack after breaking Multiscale.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>In order for Lugia to provide its team with strong defensive presence, it must be employed on teams where various Pokemon can consistently remove Stealth Rock from the field and provide cleric support.</li> <li>Pokemon like Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Dark, and Giratina can provide Defog support and effectively handle Primal Groudon or Necrozma-DM. Arceus-Ground is notable for its ability to offensively check Dragon-types with Ice Beam in the event where Lugia does not have said moves, and revenge kill Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM. Both Arceus-Dark and Giratina can avoid Shadow Tag users, and the former can check dangerous wallbreakers like Ultra Necrozma and Lunala while the latter can effectively absorb status for Lugia and handle Ho-Oh well.</li> <li>Mega Sableye is another noteworthy partner that can provide entry hazard control with Magic Bounce. Magic Bounce is useful for bouncing back Stealth Rock and other status moves, punishing a foe's attempt to hinder Lugia. Mega Sableye also offensively checks Ultra Necrozma and Extreme Killer Arceus, which Lugia struggles to take down immediately, with Foul Play. The ability to completely shut down defensive Necrozma-DM and benefiting from Lugia's Toxic with Fake Out are other notable reasons why Mega Sableye has good synergy with Lugia.</li> <li>Clerics like Chansey and Blissey can cure Lugia's status with Heal Bell and absorb status themselves thanks to Natural Cure. They can also deal with powerful special attackers like Xerneas and Primal Kyogre more consistently with their sheer special bulk. Xerneas and Magearna are appropriate clerics as well, and they can also check Dark-types and, in the former's case, Marshadow.</li> <li>As Lugia struggles to do much against Steel-types, Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh can be good partners. Primal Groudon sets Stealth Rock to keep Yveltal in line and makes up for Lugia's passivity with its offensive presence. Ho-Oh can spread various status ailments to facilitate Lugia's attempt to stall foes with residual damage, and Lugia appreciates Ho-Oh's ability to spread burns and further worsen physical attackers' matchup against it. Ho-Oh's Regenerator is also worth noting, as this allows Ho-Oh to effectively scout many Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM sets without sustaining much damage. Scouting aforementioned foes is somewhat dangerous for Lugia due to them potentially carrying Stealth Rock or other status moves.</li> <li>Entry hazard users can make Lugia's Whirlwind and Dragon Tail more useful and also punish Toxic-immune Pokemon every time they switch into Lugia. Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Dark, and Tyranitar are Stealth Rock users that can be employed on teams that Lugia generally secures its place in. Ferrothorn and Skarmory can set Spikes, which harshly punishes Steel-types' attempts to take advantage of Lugia, and they can check some troublesome foes like Primal Kyogre and Necrozma-DM, respectively.</li> <li>Mega Gengar can trap and remove clerics to prevent them from curing poison and take advantage of Lugia spreading poison with Hex. In events where Lugia fails to stop offensive foes but manages to put them on a timer, Mega Gengar can trap and revenge kill them.</li> <li>Toxapex can set Toxic Spikes to further aid Lugia's attempt to Toxic stall foes, can check Marshadow, and can check many sweepers that remain as the last Pokemon with Haze.</li> <li>Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar and Alolan Muk can trap and remove Mega Gengar from play.</li> </ul> "

  "Ho-Oh": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Ho-Oh stands out in Ubers as both a defensive and offensive cornerstone to balance teams.</li> <li>The combination of Ho-Oh's typing, stats, movepool, and most importantly, Regenerator offer the potential to fulfill multiple roles, ranging from a Defog user to an offensive wallbreaker.</li> <li>Regenerator is the most important aspect of Ho-Oh's viability. It helps to offset the many forms of residual damage it may face and also makes it very difficult to take down without proper Stealth Rock support, and the user of Stealth Rock may have to contend with Ho-Oh itself to keep Stealth Rock up.</li> <li>From a defensive standpoint, Ho-Oh's resistances to Fire, Fairy, and Steel and immunity to Ground when combined with its high Special Defense offer it great matchups against many top threats in Ubers such as Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, Yveltal, and Xerneas.</li> <li>This extends to Ho-Oh's potential as a Defog user, as it is capable of switching into and using Defog against most Stealth Rock variants of Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Ho-Oh is also very threatening offensively, as its STAB coverage when paired with the threat of Toxic makes it a nightmare to switch into, regardless of its role on a team.</li> <li>The main drawback to Ho-Oh is that the requirement of additional anti-hazard support limits the teams it can fit into. Being forced out by the common Zygarde-C and Mega Salamence is also a notable downside that can limit its effectiveness.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Choice Band Ho-Oh can opt for Sleep Talk over Toxic, as it allows Ho-Oh to switch into sleep-inducers like Smeargle, Darkrai, and the rare Z-Hypnosis Lunala. However, there are very few actual cases where this is handy.</li> <li>Z-Celebrate is another option for Ho-Oh but is very difficult to execute due to its weakness to Stealth Rock. It also cannot have Regenerator when running Celebrate, making it even more weak to Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Ho-Oh could run Flame Charge to boost its Speed and give it a shot at sweeping late-game. Unfortunately, its Speed is too low at +1 to outspeed threatening Choice Scarf users such as Yveltal and Thunder Xerneas.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Ho-Oh has a crippling weakness to Stealth Rock, which is carried on almost every viable team. Users of the move include support Arceus formes like Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Ground, Necrozma-DM, Deoxys-S, and Excadrill.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde-C: Zygarde-C is able to take hits from Ho-Oh with ease thanks to its great physical bulk and can proceed to paralyze Ho-Oh with Glare or KO it with Thousand Arrows. Zygarde-C also usually carries Rest, which makes it difficult to weaken with Toxic, and thus one of the best checks to Ho-Oh. Offensive sets with Substitute can also set up on Ho-Oh by avoiding burns from Sacred Fire.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Arceus-Water is bulky enough to take a Brave Bird from Ho-Oh and stall it out with Toxic or 2HKO it with Judgment; however, Ho-Oh can go for Toxic as Arceus-Water switches in, setting it on a timer. Primal Kyogre can outspeed some variants of Ho-Oh and proceed to deal heavy damage if not OHKO with a Water-type STAB move; however, faster variants of Ho-Oh can OHKO Primal Kyogre after it takes damage from Stealth Rock. Defensive variants of Primal Kyogre can take a Brave Bird and deal heavy damage back with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon: Primal Groudon is resistant to Sacred Fire and immune to burn, and its high Defense stat allows it to tank a hit and proceed to OHKO back with Rock Tomb. However, Primal Groudon has no form of reliable recovery and gets crippled by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Mega Salamence</strong>: Bulky variants of Mega Salamence can stall out Brave Bird with Roost to the point where Ho-Oh KOes itself due to recoil. It can also absorb Sacred Fire with no fear of getting burned thanks to Refresh and Facade.</p> <p><strong>Zekrom</strong>: Zekrom resists both of Ho-Oh's STAB moves and can OHKO it with Bolt Strike. However, Zekrom cannot switch in directly, as it can get crippled by a burn from Sacred Fire.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type attacks</strong>: Rock-types such as Arceus-Rock and Tyranitar can OHKO Ho-Oh with their Rock-type STAB moves. Ho-Oh's typing makes it very vulnerable to Rock-type attacks, which are usually run by Ultra Necrozma, Necrozma-DM, Marshadow, and Arceus-Ground and occasionally by Arceus-Fairy and Mega Lucario.</p> <p><strong>Giratina: Thanks to its ability Pressure and great defensive stats, Giratina is able to cripple Ho-Oh with Toxic and proceed to PP stall it with Rest. It can also phaze Curse Ho-Oh with Dragon Tail.</p> <p><strong>Lugia</strong>: Lugia can easily Toxic stall Ho-Oh with Roost. However, since many Ho-Oh sets carry Toxic, it is difficult for Lugia to switch into Ho-Oh, and it must avoid Toxic in order to preserve its Multiscale.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Toxic users such as Primal Groudon and support Arceus formes can cripple Ho-Oh, which forces it out frequently, since the damage can easily rack up; however, Regenerator can reduce the effects of Toxic. Arceus-Dragon, for example, is able to cripple Ho-Oh with Toxic and proceed to beat it one-on-one thanks to neutral STAB Judgment dealing considerable damage. However, this leaves Arceus-Dragon weak and susceptible.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Sacred Fire is Ho-Oh's ideal STAB move, and it combines well with Toxic to put a lot of pressure on Pokemon that attempt to switch in due to its high burn rate. Without Sacred Fire, Steel-types such as Necrozma-DM are capable of easily forcing Ho-Oh out and setting Stealth Rock against it.</li> <li>Flamethrower, although weaker, can be used instead for a Fire-type STAB move with significantly more PP to threaten foes like Ferrothorn longer. Since Flamethrower has a lower chance to burn a foe, support Arceus formes can become easier to deal with, as they can no longer switch into a predicted Sacred Fire to get burned and avoid getting badly poisoned by Toxic. Note that Flamethrower's disappointingly low damage output against Necrozma-DM can be a detriment.</li> <li>Recover is necessary to keep Ho-Oh healthy, as Regenerator cannot be solely relied on to maintain longevity. Recover is chosen over Roost to prevent predicted Ground-type moves from the likes of Primal Groudon from catching Ho-Oh as it attempts to heal.</li> <li>Toxic alongside Sacred Fire spreads status very easily, as the threat of Sacred Fire prevents Steel-types from switching in to take Toxic. It also makes beating various Arceus formes far easier and puts a lot of pressure on Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Defog may seem strange on a Pokemon that is 4x weak to Stealth Rock, but the common Stealth Rock setters in Ubers such as Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM tend to lack the coverage to set Stealth Rock and feasibly beat Ho-Oh at the same time. Ho-Oh's matchup against Spikes setters such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn is also very one sided, making it an attractive choice to keep entry hazards away.</li> <li>Brave Bird can be used if the removal of entry hazards is sufficiently covered elsewhere and offers more damage against most Pokemon resistant to Sacred Fire such as Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre. Fighting-types such as Marshadow and Mega Blaziken are also hit much harder by Brave Bird.</li> <li>Whirlwind can also be used to phaze out boosting threats such as Calm Mind Arceus formes and Swords Dance Necrozma-DM before they overwhelm Ho-Oh.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum HP investment alongside 52 Special Defense EVs prevent +2 Xerneas from OHKOing Ho-Oh with Thunder.</li> <li>A notable trait of maximum HP investment is that Ho-Oh hits 416 HP, which means that it will gain 26 HP from Leftovers recovery compared to 25 if running 248 HP EVs. This Ho-Oh set prefers to avoid Stealth Rock damage as much as possible, so the use of an even HP number is a good trade off.</li> <li>The remaining EVs go into Ho-Oh's lesser Defense stat with an Impish nature so it can better handle physical attacks from the likes of Marshadow, avoiding a 2HKO from Spectral Thief.</li> <li>Leftovers and Regenerator provide Ho-Oh with a means of constant healing, minimizing chip damage from the likes of Toxic, resisted attacks, and Brave Bird recoil.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Ho-Oh's main priority with this set is to be a durable check to top threats. Ho-Oh has a good matchup against Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Marshadow variants that lack Rock-type moves, and it also does well against most Xerneas and Yveltal variants.</li> <li>If used as a Defogger, some risky assessments may have to be made to ensure Ho-Oh is not switching into an unfavorable matchup. Switching into an unscouted Primal Groudon or Necrozma-DM can lead to a nasty surprise if they are carrying Rock-type coverage. Look out for indications that Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM are not using an offensive set, such as the usage of Overheat or Toxic from Primal Groudon and Leftovers recovery on Necrozma-DM, to make a better judgment.</li> <li>At the same time, Ho-Oh needs to switch into the usage of Stealth Rock before it can take damage from it if it wants to successfully use Defog. If in doubt, switch to a secondary check that can take on Primal Groudon or Necrozma-DM, assuming they are carrying Rock-type coverage.</li> <li>Passive Steel-types such as Skarmory and Ferrothorn are easily dealt with by Ho-Oh. Magearna is an odd case, as it can pivot out with Volt Switch when Ho-Oh comes in, making it a bit more annoying to handle. Necrozma-DM and Mega Lucario require careful play to avoid potential Rock-type coverage moves or, in the case of Necrozma-DM, a surprise Ultra Necrozma set.</li> <li>Look for opportunities to switch Ho-Oh in and out of battle if it is low on HP, such as against foes using non-damaging moves. Multiple turns of Regenerator recovery can bring Ho-Oh back up to a healthy state with little risk.</li> <li>Spread status with Sacred Fire and Toxic against Ho-Oh's common switch-ins such as Mega Salamence, Tyranitar, and Zygarde-C to wear them down, eventually forcing a recovery move to take advantage of.</li> <li>If Stealth Rock does go up, Ho-Oh's effectiveness as a defensive check can go down the drain. Prioritize its removal if Ho-Oh is needed to check various threats.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>As a Pokemon best suited to balance teams, Ho-Oh's best partners are those that can defensively cover its weaknesses and still provide some offensive pressure.</li> <li>It should be noted that Ho-Oh should not be the only anti-hazard Pokemon in most teams it is used on, as some Stealth Rock users such as Tyranitar and Swords Dance + Stealth Rock Primal Groudon are capable of winning against Ho-Oh in a one-on-one situation. Alternative Defoggers such as support Arceus formes and both Giratina formes or Magic Bounce from users like Mega Sableye should be strongly considered on Ho-Oh teams to prevent it from being ineffective in certain matchups.</li> <li>Arceus-Water stands out as a very good partner. It can provide an alternative check to Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM, and it also acts as a pivot against Water-type moves and as an extra user of Defog to help Ho-Oh out if it is unable to keep Stealth Rock away by itself.</li> <li>Clerics such as Magearna and Xerneas are great for mitigating Toxic damage on Ho-Oh and supporting the rest of the team.</li> <li>Mega Sableye can assist Ho-Oh in shutting down passive Pokemon that may attempt to check it. An important trait of Mega Sableye is that it can handle Ultra Necrozma, something Ho-Oh struggles against. Magic Bounce can also come in handy against status and entry hazard users.</li> <li>Primal Groudon can act as an offensive wallbreaker or a Stealth Rock setter for Ho-Oh to maintain pressure with. It also helps against many of the Pokemon Ho-Oh usually intends to check such as Steel- and Fairy-types.</li> <li>Other Ground-types such as Zygarde-C and Arceus-Ground offer alternative Primal Groudon checks to take some of the pressure off of Ho-Oh. Zygarde-C in particular is helpful against Rock-type coverage from the likes of Marshadow. Support Arceus-Ground can also assist against Mega Salamence, a common Ho-Oh switch-in.</li> <li>Mega Gengar can use Hex to take advantage of the status Ho-Oh can spread across the enemy team, and it can revenge kill troublesome Pokemon to Ho-Oh such as Ultra Necrozma.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM is a formidable Xerneas check that can afford to choose between a Stealth Rock set or an offensive one thanks to the support of Ho-Oh. It also assists against Mega Salamence and uncommon Rock-type Pokemon such as Tyranitar.</li> <li>Both formes of Giratina can help Ho-Oh against Pokemon it may struggle with such as Arceus-Ground and Primal Groudon variants that carry Rock-type coverage, and they also give Ho-Oh the ability to forgo Defog and run Brave Bird for better offensive pressure. Giratina is a better fit to stall teams, while Giratina-O's offensive potential suits balance teams better.</li> </ul> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Brave Bird is Ho-Oh's strongest STAB move, with a high damage output against Mega Mewtwo Y and Dragon-types like Ultra Necrozma and Rayquaza. With Choice Scarf, Ho-Oh can outspeed and 2HKO Yveltal and Primal Kyogre and cleanly OHKO Marshadow.</li> <li>Sacred Fire is a secondary STAB attack that lacks recoil and has the additional utility of spreading burns apart from threatening Steel-types like Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn.</li> <li>Toxic, combined with Sacred Fire, makes switching into Ho-Oh safely extremely difficult, as most foes that can defensively keep Ho-Oh in check are vulnerable to residual damage. With Stealth Rock and Toxic damage, Ho-Oh can outspeed and 2HKO fast Arceus-Water and offensive Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Defog can be dangerous to be locked into, but Ho-Oh's increased offensive presence with offensive investment and Choice Scarf makes it possible to utilize on forced switches. Being able to remove entry hazards in pinch along with Ho-Oh's immunity to Sticky Web and higher Speed from Choice Scarf can potentially turn the tables against offensive teams as well.</li> <li>Earthquake hits Primal Groudon and Mega Gengar harder than Brave Bird without making Ho-Oh suffer from recoil damage. It also is also the best attacking option against Toxapex and the less common Tyranitar, Mega Diancie, and Arceus-Rock. It also deals more reliably with mixed Rock Polish Primal Groudon than Brave Bird, as two Fire Blasts from Primal Groudon and recoil damage can potentially cause an unwanted trade, while Earthquake gives Ho-Oh a higher chance to 2HKO Primal Groudon without making it take recoil damage.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum investment in Attack allows Ho-Oh to hit as hard as possible. A Jolly nature with maximum Speed investment is needed to outspeed neutral-natured Choice Scarf Xerneas and Yveltal and Deoxys-A. Adamant Rayquaza and the rarer Adamant Mega Blaziken are also vulnerable at +1 to Jolly Ho-Oh holding a Choice Scarf.</li> <li>Regenerator enables Ho-Oh to consistently pivot into weak or resisted attacks and mitigate damage from Brave Bird's recoil and potential poison.</li> <li>Choice Scarf boosts Ho-Oh's Speed, letting it outspeed faster foes like Ultra Necrozma, Marshadow, and Mega Mewtwo Y and reliably revenge kill them.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>By forgoing defensive investment, recovery moves, and the option to switch moves, this variant of Ho-Oh trades defensive capabilities with the ability to revenge kill faster foes.</li> <li>This means Ho-Oh can more reliably take on foes like weakened Ultra Necrozma, Marshadow, and Mega Lucario, which may otherwise outspeed and OHKO Ho-Oh first with their coverage moves, but will be much less flexible as an entry hazard remover and a check to threats like mixed Rock Polish Primal Groudon or support Arceus formes, roles that require Ho-Oh to have defensive investment and Recover to effectively fulfill.</li> <li>Even with reduced defensive capabilities, Ho-Oh can more liberally pivot into weaker or resisted attacks thanks to Regenerator than other Choice Scarf users like Xerneas and Yveltal that have more concerns about their longevity. Though foes like Geomancy Xerneas can overpower Ho-Oh in one-on-one situations, Ho-Oh still has sufficient bulk to pivot into Choice Scarf Xerneas and support Arceus formes. Even foes that can hit Ho-Oh quite hard, such as Yveltal, can be scouted with Ho-Oh so that their sets may be identified.</li> <li>Take full advantage of Ho-Oh's role compression as a status absorber, a revenge killer, and a physical attacker. Ho-Oh may have to play more carefully to outlast Toxic users, but it has superior matchups against a good number of Toxic users in the tier. Making a safe switch into this set can also be extremely difficult for teams that lack specific counters to Ho-Oh like defensive Zygarde and Giratina, which Ho-Oh can still eventually force to use Rest with Toxic and repeated Brave Birds.</li> <li>Ho-Oh can make more aggressive moves once it becomes clear that an opponent will rely on blanket checks like support Arceus formes and defensive Primal Groudon that can be defeated with repeated attacks. Most blanket checks are vulnerable to Brave Bird after getting poisoned by Toxic, and the same applies to faster foes like Arceus-Water and offensive Mega Salamence, which Ho-Oh has better chance to take on with Choice Scarf.</li> <li>Entry hazard management becomes more important for Choice Scarf Ho-Oh due to its inability to remove entry hazards reliably. Ho-Oh will be reliant on forcing a switch to effectively use Defog against entry hazard setters. As Ho-Oh alone cannot prevent Stealth Rock from Primal Groudon and even Arceus formes it has superior matchup against, consider keeping other Defog users healthy until the opposing team can no longer consistently set Stealth Rock. Not only does Stealth Rock take away a half of Ho-Oh's HP on the switch, but it also forces Ho-Oh into a situation where it will have to lock itself into Defog or use another move and hope one of its teammates will get a chance to remove Stealth Rock themselves before it gets to switch in again.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Many balanced teams can benefit from Ho-Oh's ability to threaten Steel-types, perform well against offensive teams, spread various status ailments, and sponge special attacks from Xerneas and Arceus formes. Ho-Oh is somewhat of a secondary performer of these roles due to its lack of flexibility that comes from holding Choice Scarf, but it can still defeat Xerneas checks like Primal Groudon and Steel-types and fare well against support Arceus formes.</li> <li>Steel-types will mostly come in handy with their ability to pivot into Toxic and take on Arceus formes relatively well. The likes of Necrozma-DM and Magearna function as secondary Xerneas checks, and Ferrothorn can do a better job at walling Arceus-Water and set Spikes to pressure most checks to Ho-Oh apart from Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Primal Groudon can also offer similar support. Depending on the variant, Primal Groudon can status support Arceus formes and Lugia or set entry hazards against them. However, as Ho-Oh will eventually draw in support Arceus formes and can poison them with Toxic, Primal Groudon has even more options to run offensive variant and lure various foes for Ho-Oh. Hidden Power Ice will catch Zygarde and Mega Salamence, Rock Tomb will deal with opposing Ho-Oh running defensive investment, and Swords Dance-boosted attacks can take out Arceus formes more quickly.</li> <li>Support Arceus formes can deal with defensive Zygarde, which is a strong check to this set. They also provide Defog support and handle Rock-type coverage Primal Groudon reasonably well. Giratina-O can fulfill similar roles and can take out offensive Primal Groudon more quickly.</li> <li>Xerneas can also provide Defog support or run Geomancy set, as Ho-Oh is running Choice Scarf itself to threaten offensive teams and offensively check Marshadow. Aromatherapy can be used to alleviate Ho-Oh of status as well.</li> <li>Mega Gengar can benefit from Ho-Oh's ability to spread status and revenge kill Marshadow and faster threats like Mega Mewtwo Y and Deoxys-A, which will otherwise limit its activity on the field. Its ability to trap Ultra Necrozma is also notable, as Ho-Oh will lock itself into Sacred Fire before Necrozma-DM transforms via Ultra Burst.</li> </ul> "

It allows Ho-Oh to beat Zygarde and Mega Salamence one-on-one thanks to the boost in Defense.</li> <li>Substitute is an option that lets Ho-Oh avoid getting inflicted with status from support Arceus formes, making it easier to play around them.</li> <li>If Ho-Oh runs Life Orb, Hidden Power Ice is a good option that lets Ho-Oh always OHKO Mega Salamence and OHKO Zygarde that have taken damage from Brave Bird.</li> <li>Earthquake can hit Primal Groudon and Toxapex without incurring recoil from Brave Bird while also 2HKOing Rock-types such as Tyranitar and the rare Arceus-Rock.</li> <li>Defog can be considered on this set to add more options against entry hazard setters throughout the game.

This is more sensible on Curse sets, which do not need to outspeed anything.</li> <li>Life Orb gives Ho-Oh more initial power in exchange for recoil every turn. Flyinium Z can be used instead when Ho-Oh is running Curse, as +1 Supersonic Skystrike can eliminate Zygarde, Giratina, and Lugia after taking damage from Stealth Rock.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Ho-Oh relies heavily on teammates with Defog or Rapid Spin to keep Stealth Rock off of your side of the field so it can function properly.</li> <li>Teams with Ho-Oh must put as much pressure as possible on the opposing team's Stealth Rock setter in order to keep Ho-Oh from taking massive damage prior to making a move. Run a Steel-type, and try to use it to lure Primal Groudon, which is the one of the best Stealth Rock setters, and set it on a timer with Toxic.</li> <li>Against teams with Necrozma-DM, scout for Rock-type coverage like Stone Edge and Power Gem before using Ho-Oh to check it. It is best to switch Ho-Oh in on its use of Stealth Rock, as this avoids taking damage from Stealth Rock, giving Ho-Oh an open chance to attack.</li> <li>Sending Ho-Oh in on predicted Steel-types like Magearna, Celesteela, and Ferrothorn will then allow it to apply pressure onto the opposing team.</li> <li>Go for Toxic on predicted switches into defensive threats like support Arceus formes and Lugia; they need to be crippled for Ho-Oh to break through them.</li> <li>Be cautious when going for Sacred Fire, as the move only has 8 PP. You might prefer crippling certain defensive threats like Lugia with Toxic over burning them with Sacred Fire as well.</li> <li>Scout for Rock-type coverage from physical threats like Primal Groudon, Ultra Necrozma, Marshadow, and Mega Lucario, which Ho-Oh can often switch into otherwise.</li> <li>Take advantage of Regenerator by switching Ho-Oh out and sacrificing less important teammates to gain health.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Entry hazard removers such as Arceus-Dark, Defog Mega Salamence, Defog Xerneas, and Giratina-O are the best teammates for Ho-Oh due to its weakness to Stealth Rock.

Ho-Oh can check Pokemon that Zygarde-C usually struggles against like Arceus-Fairy, Xerneas, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela.</li> <li>Ferrothorn is able to check Primal Kyogre and provide Spikes support for Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Magearna is able to relieve Ho-Oh of the pressure of checking special attackers like Yveltal, Xerneas, and Calm Mind variants of Ultra Necrozma.

The ubiquity of Ghost-types in the tier can also open up the door for opponents to outplay High Jump Kick and force Mega Blaziken to KO itself in tandem with Flare Blitz recoil.</li> <li>Hidden Power Ice is an option to hit Mega Salamence and Zygarde, but using this means Mega Blaziken loses Swords Dance and is therefore suboptimal.</li> <li>Swords Dance + Knock Off with Darkinium Z is an option that can OHKO Giratina-O at +2 and Lugia after Stealth Rock. However, Blaziken without Protect is very slow, and the lack of Life Orb makes it somewhat weak at the same time.</li> <li>Substitute + Reversal can deal with Zygarde but is not as viable as the main set due to the lack of coverage if Blaziken runs Swords Dance and the lack of power if it decides to drop Swords Dance for a coverage move.</li> <li>Z-Mirror Move with Substitute or Protect is another option Blaziken can opt for that allows it to beat Primal Groudon and opposing Mega Blaziken.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Giratina Formes</strong>: Both Giratina formes are able to switch into Mega Blaziken and take any hit with ease thanks to their typing and great defensive stats. Giratina-O is able to threaten it back with Ghost- or Dragon-type STAB attacks, whereas Giratina can phaze it with Roar or Dragon Tail and cripple it with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Toxapex and Mega Slowbro can switch into Mega Blaziken with ease, as they take minimal damage from its STAB moves and Stone Edge. Toxapex can neutralize its boost from Swords Dance with Haze and set up Toxic Spikes on it, only having to worry about Earthquake, while Mega Slowbro can put Mega Blaziken on a timer with Toxic and stall it out with Slack Off. Primal Kyogre may not be able to switch into Mega Blaziken, but it can take one unboosted hit and OHKO back with a Water-type STAB move.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde-C: With its sky-high HP and great Defense, Zygarde-C is able to switch in, take any hit from Mega Blaziken, and KO it with Thousand Arrows or cripple it with Glare before phazing it with Dragon Tail.</p> <p><strong>Support Arceus Formes</strong>: Support Arceus formes like Arceus-Fairy, Arceus-Water, and Arceus-Ground are able to take any one hit from Mega Blaziken, and the latter two OHKO back with STAB Judgment.</p> <p><strong>Lugia: Lugia is able to switch into any attack from Mega Blaziken and phaze it with Whirlwind. It can also stall Mega Blaziken out of Stone Edge PP, forcing it to KO itself with Flare Blitz recoil. However, with Stealth Rock up, +2 Stone Edge is able to OHKO Lugia due to losing its Multiscale protection.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Support sets of Primal Groudon are able to take +2 Low Kick from full HP and OHKO Mega Blaziken with Precipice Blades.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Faster threats such Choice Scarf users like Yveltal and Xerneas can outspeed Mega Blaziken and OHKO it without Speed boosts. Even if it is at +1 Speed, the aforementioned Pokemon are both able to take any unboosted hit from Mega Blaziken. Support Arceus formes like Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Fairy, Mega Salamence, and Mega Gengar can also outspeed Mega Blaziken and deal massive damage or OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Ultra Necrozma: Ultra Necrozma can outspeed Mega Blaziken and OHKO it with Photon Geyser or Earthquake.

This implies its potency to carry Skill Swap, as Deoxys-S will otherwise be hopelessly shut down by Mega Sableye and will have no other reason to lead against it. Consider postponing Mega Evolution against Deoxys-S if it seems to potentially have a dedicated way to bypass Magic Bounce and leads against Sableye.</li> <li>Mega Sableye also fails to stop Excadrill from setting Stealth Rock. The best Mega Sableye can do against Excadrill is break its Focus Sash with Fake Out and switch to an offensive check to limit Excadrill to a single turn of utilizing its support options.</li> <li>Refrain from leading with Mega Sableye when Tapu Lele is on the opposing team, as Sableye cannot safely Mega Evolve due to Psychic Terrain blocking Fake Out, unless it is using the rare Protect.</li> <li>Liberally switch Mega Sableye into passive Pokemon. Entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, certain Arceus formes, and Blissey struggle to do anything against Mega Sableye due to Magic Bounce.</li> <li>Although Mega Sableye is relatively bulky when taking its defensive typing into account, it is forced out against a decent portion of the tier. Some common threats like Primal Groudon, Arceus-Fairy, and other Arceus formes with offensive investment like Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Water are also Stealth Rock users that match up well versus Mega Sableye. Do not recklessly attempt to predict odd moves from them and be quick to withdraw Mega Sableye from any dangerous matchups, especially when passive foes from the opposing team have to be kept in check by Mega Sableye.</li> <li>Keeping Mega Sableye healthy is crucial for maintaining the upper hand over entry hazards and status ailments. Mega Sableye also narrowly avoids OHKOs from some threats like Necrozma-DM and Marshadow, so use Recover frequently to prepare Mega Sableye to be directly switched into foes it must handle.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Many teams that employ Mega Sableye aim to outlast other teams by preventing major sources of residual damage, namely entry hazards and status. Teammates that can handle the hazard setters that overpower Mega Sableye can assist in accomplishing this objective.</li> <li>Ho-Oh is one of the most common Pokemon paired with Mega Sableye for this reason. Stealth Rock variants of Primal Groudon and Arceus-Fairy struggle to combat Ho-Oh, and Ho-Oh is capable of threatening all relevant clerics. Ho-Oh is also notable for being able to completely shut down Toxapex alongside Mega Sableye, as Toxapex with Scald may outlast Mega Sableye but will be completely stopped by Ho-Oh, while those that forgo Scald for Toxic will have no method to deal with Mega Sableye. Regenerator also allows Ho-Oh to pivot into a good number of threats so Mega Sableye will not have to risk taking heavy damage. Ho-Oh's access to both Sacred Fire and Toxic further aids Mega Sableye's attempt to spread status, as Mega Sableye cannot justify using both Toxic and Will-O-Wisp in its moveset. Mega Sableye discourages Stealth Rock, which would otherwise heavily undermine Ho-Oh's effectiveness and leave Ho-Oh more vulnerable to certain threats, such as Ultra Necrozma, Marshadow with Rock Tomb, and boosted Extreme Killer Arceus.</li> <li>Other entry hazard removers that check powerful hazard setters are appropriate team options as well. Arceus-Ground handles most Primal Groudon variants and offensively checks Mega Lucario, which can take advantage of Mega Sableye lacking Will-O-Wisp. Arceus-Dark does not necessarily prevent entry hazards well, but it can viably use Defog and check Yveltal, Lunala, and other wallbreakers that can overwhelm Mega Sableye. Many Arceus formes can run Ice Beam to check threatening attackers like Zygarde-C and Rayquaza. Giratina checks Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh, spreads various status, and provides Defog support.</li> <li>Lugia appreciates Mega Sableye deterring Stealth Rock and status moves and can check a broader range of threats in the tier with its superior bulk. With Multiscale intact, it also checks Ultra Necrozma with Outrage, which can easily defeat Mega Sableye after a Swords Dance.</li> <li>Primal Groudon checks Fairy-types and is one of the very few safe switch-ins to Primal Kyogre. Defensive variants can set Stealth Rock to prevent Yveltal and Ho-Oh from attempting to switch in on Mega Sableye and force it out. Primal Groudon can also carry Toxic to allow Mega Sableye to free up a slot for Will-O-Wisp. Both of them can work together to spread status well, as Primal Groudon forces out most Toxic-immune Pokemon in the tier, while Mega Sableye can lure in and burn Steel-types that would avoid Primal Groudon and rather contend with Mega Sableye instead.</li> <li>In a similar vein, Ferrothorn can fit with Mega Sableye to check Primal Kyogre and Fairy-types while also providing Spikes support to wear down the opposing team more quickly. Ferrothorn also takes advantage of many support Arceus formes, which is a good news for any Mega Sableye not running a specially defensive EV spread.</li> <li>Primal Kyogre can check Necrozma-DM well and appreciates Mega Sableye completely shutting down Ferrothorn and preventing it from recovering. Primal Kyogre can also take advantage of most Pokemon that threaten Mega Sableye. Defensive Primal Kyogre can also provide Mega Sableye with valuable defensive presence against support Arceus formes.</li> <li>Clerics like Magearna and Blissey can check special attackers with their typing and colossal special bulk, respectively, and cure Mega Sableye of status ailments to further improve its longevity.</li> </ul> "

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Mega Salamence is an offensive powerhouse thanks to a high Attack stat, access to Dragon Dance, and a powerful ability in Aerilate to help bolster its Normal-type attacks into stronger Flying-type STAB attacks.</li> <li>It's a highly versatile Pokemon with a fantastic offensive and supportive movepool, which allows it to fit on to a plethora of different teams and playstyles.</li> <li>Mega Salamence sits at a high Speed tier of base 120, which enables it to naturally outspeed key threats such as Mega Lucario, Yveltal, unboosted Xerneas, and Rayquaza while potentially Speed tying with Arceus formes.</li> <li>Thanks to a combination of Salamence's Intimidate ability prior to Mega Evolution, a base 130 Defense stat, and a Ground-type immunity, Mega Salamence is one of the premier offensive checks to many of the tier's most prominent physical attackers, especially Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Mega Salamence has reliable recovery in the form of Roost, which enables it to repeatedly switch into the Pokemon it's designed to check and find more setup opportunities for a Dragon Dance sweep.</li> <li>Mega Salamence stands out as an offensive Defog user thanks to its immunity to Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web; access to high-powered STAB attacks; high Speed; reliable recovery; ability to scare away Ubers's most common Stealth Rock user in Primal Groudon; and lack of fear of being trapped by Gothitelle thanks to Double-Edge 2HKOing it even if Charm was used before the second attack.</li> <li>Mega Salamence has a plethora of checks and counters in the tier that can stop it, such as Zygarde-C, Celesteela, Lugia, and Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Since Mega Salamence's main STAB attack is Double-Edge, the recoil damage produced by this move chips away at Mega Salamence's health relatively quickly, and it doesn't help that most of Mega Salamence's targets in Ubers have high HP stats.</li> <li>Mega Salamence has a nasty Stealth Rock weakness that limits its switch in potential, especially if it has yet to Mega Evolve.</li> <li>Many Pokemon in the Ubers tier, such as Marshadow, support Arceus formes, and Primal Groudon, can carry Ice-type attacks to take advantage of Mega Salamence's 4x Ice-type weakness to knock it out in one hit.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Return over Double-Edge gives Mega Salamence a relatively strong and recoilless attack. However, the reduced damage output compared to Double-Edge is very noticeable, and Mega Salamence loses out on potential OHKOs and 2HKOs when using it.</li> <li>Outrage is a secondary STAB move that can slam through Giratina-O and Zygarde-C, but being locked into it is a dangerous situation, as it lets Xerneas come in to set up a free Geomancy while also making Mega Salamence vulnerable to revenge killing.</li> <li>A special set with Hyper Voice, Draco Meteor, and Fire Blast can catch some of Mega Salamence's usual switch-ins off guard, but it's much weaker than the standard physical sets and has no way to boost its Special Attack stat. This set also makes Mega Salamence's matchup against Ho-Oh much worse, as not even a Modest Draco Meteor is able to OHKO Ho-Oh after Stealth Rock.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Earthquake-immune Steel-types</strong>: Celesteela, Skarmory, and Bronzong practically hard counter most Mega Salamence sets thanks to their defensive typings (and Levitate in Bronzong's case) giving them an immunity to Earthquake and a resistance to Mega Salamence's Aerilate-boosted STAB attacks. Celesteela can stall Mega Salamence out with a combination of Leech Seed, Toxic, and Protect; Skarmory can phaze Mega Salamence with Whirlwind or rely on Sturdy + Counter to stop it from sweeping; and Bronzong can use Trick Room and Gyro Ball to take advantage of Mega Salamence's high Speed stat and boosts from Dragon Dance.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde-C: Zygarde-C has the physical bulk to withstand boosted attacks from Mega Salamence and can stop a potential sweep by phazing it with Dragon Tail or paralyzing it with Glare. Even a boosted Facade from a +1 Adamant Mega Salamence is unable to knock Zygarde out before Power Construct activates as long as it's at full health.</p> <p><strong>Lugia: With its titanic bulk, which is further amplified by Multiscale, Lugia is capable of shrugging off nearly anything Mega Salamence can throw at it and either retaliating with Ice Beam or phazing it with Whirlwind or Dragon Tail. However, Stealth Rock is a major pain for Lugia, and without Multiscale, Mega Salamence has a much easier time getting past it, especially if Facade gets boosted by a status condition.</p> <p><strong>Necrozma-DM / Ultra Necrozma</strong>: Variants of Mega Salamence that lack Earthquake are easily handled by Necrozma-DM. Defensive sets can stall Mega Salamence out with a combination of Toxic and Morning Sun / Moonlight, while offensive sets are able to OHKO Mega Salamence with a Searing Sunraze Smash. If Mega Salamence does happen to have Earthquake, Necrozma-DM's Prism Armor and solid natural bulk allow it to tank a single +1 Earthquake without defensive investment as long as it's healthy. However, offensive sets need to be wary of Salamence's Intimidate ability prior to Mega Evolution, which can weaken Necrozma-DM's physical attacks. Ultra Necrozma, while it cannot switch into Double-Edge after Ultra Burst, can switch in as Necrozma-DM and knock it out the next turn with Dragon Pulse thanks to a higher Speed stat. If it happens to lack Dragon Pulse, Power Gem or Stone Edge is capable of knocking Mega Salamence out after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Magearna</strong>: Magearna has the ability to shrug off Mega Salamence's STAB attacks and use a super effective Fleur Cannon to retaliate. However, Magearna needs to be cautious of Earthquake, as a +1 Adamant Mega Salamence can knock Magearna out with it after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Support Arceus</strong>: Arceus-Water, Arceus-Ground, and Arceus-Dragon are bulky enough to withstand boosted attacks from Mega Salamence, and they can knock it out with a super effective Ice Beam or Judgment.</p> <p><strong>Arceus with a Type Advantage: Arceus-Fairy, Arceus-Rock, and Arceus-Ice are able to tank at least one boosted Double-Edge, or Earthquake in Arceus-Rock's case, from Mega Salamence and retaliate with a super effective Judgment.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon: Primal Groudon detests Salamence's Intimidate ability prior to Mega Evolution and hates taking Earthquakes, but as long as it's healthy, it has the bulk to stomach most of Mega Salamence's attacks at least once. Support sets can phaze it with Dragon Tail or Roar, and Mega Salamence sets that lack Facade don't appreciate taking a burn from Lava Plume. Special Primal Groudon sets also tend to run Hidden Power Ice, which OHKOes Mega Salamence.</p> <p><strong>Dialga and Zekrom</strong>: Dialga and Zekrom resist Mega Salamence's Flying-type attacks and retaliate with Draco Meteor or Outrage, respectively. Both of these Pokemon can also run Shuca Berry to weaken Ground-type attacks, which is bad news for Earthquake Mega Salamence.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre and Giratina-O</strong>: Defensive Primal Kyogre and Giratina-O can't switch in on Mega Salamence, but they have the bulk to survive a +1 Double-Edge to knock it out with Ice Beam or Draco Meteor, respectively. Offensive Primal Kyogre sets can still eat an unboosted Double-Edge from full to OHKO Mega Salamence in the same manner.</p> <p><strong>Mega Slowbro</strong>: Mega Slowbro has a massive amount of physical bulk, which lets it withstand Mega Salamence's strongest attacks. Iron Defense prevents Mega Slowbro from falling behind Mega Salamence's Dragon Dance, while Shell Armor prevents critical hits to ensure Mega Slowbro's survival. Lastly, Ice Beam OHKOes Mega Salamence. However, Mega Slowbro needs to be wary of a potential Toxic from the Defog set.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pokemon with Ice-type Coverage</strong>: Marshadow, Primal Groudon, and Ho-Oh are some examples of Pokemon that pack Ice-type moves to deal with Mega Salamence.</p> ",

        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Dragon Dance bolsters Mega Salamence's Attack and Speed stats, enabling it to outpace most of the boosted metagame at +1 and sweep through weakened teams.</li> <li>Double-Edge is Mega Salamence's main STAB attack. When unboosted, it has the strength to 2HKO defensive Yveltal, Gothitelle, support Arceus formes, and Lugia after Stealth Rock. After a Dragon Dance, Double-Edge OHKOes standard Geomancy Xerneas, Mega Sableye, and offensive Arceus formes after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Roost helps sustain Mega Salamence's health, allowing it to find more setup opportunities throughout the match.</li> <li>Facade lets Mega Salamence take advantage of burn and poison status afflictions caused by Ho-Oh, Primal Groudon, and Necrozma-DM, becoming stronger than Double-Edge once Mega Salamence is statused. A +1 status-boosted Facade is strong enough to OHKO Ferrothorn without entry hazards and is capable of knocking out Lugia and fast support Arceus formes after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Earthquake can be used instead of Facade to improve Mega Salamence's matchup versus Necrozma-DM, Magearna, and Tyranitar and to hit Primal Groudon almost as hard as Double-Edge without making Mega Salamence suffer from recoil damage.</li> <li>Substitute allows Mega Salamence to bypass status conditions and ensure that a Dragon Dance goes off, along with preventing Primal Groudon's and Giratina-O's Dragon Tail from phazing it. However, Mega Salamence is still susceptible to non-damaging phazing moves such as Roar and Whirlwind.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Salamencite is required to Mega Evolve into Mega Salamence.</li> <li>An Adamant nature and 252 Attack EVs are used to provide Mega Salamence as much damage potential as possible.</li> <li>212 Speed EVs enable Mega Salamence to naturally outpace maximum Speed base 100 Pokemon and below, such as Yveltal, Rayquaza, Tapu Lele, Primal Groudon, and Primal Kyogre, and to outpace Choice Scarf Xerneas and Yveltal after a boost.</li> <li>44 HP EVs let Mega Salamence survive a Life Orb-boosted Brave Bird from Ho-Oh after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>If Life Orb Ho-Oh isn't a concern, a spread using 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe can be used to outspeed Necrozma-DM after it has set up an Autotomize once Mega Salamence uses Dragon Dance. A Jolly nature with the same spread lets Mega Salamence naturally Speed tie with Arceus formes and opposing Mega Salamence and outpaces everything slower, especially Pokemon such as Mega Lucario and Mega Diancie, and at +1 Speed, it is faster than Adamant Sand Rush Excadrill in sand and below. However, the difference in power from Adamant to Jolly is noticeable, and Sand Rush Excadrill is an extremely rare set.</li> <li>If Substitute is being used, a spread using 248 HP / 64 Atk / 124 Def / 72 Spe with an Impish nature is recommended, as it prevents Mega Salamence's Substitute from being broken by Celesteela's Heavy Slam and defensive Zygarde-C's Thousand Arrows and lowers the chance of Zygarde-C's Dragon Tail breaking Substitute as well. This turns two would-be checks into setup fodder. 72 Speed EVs will also allow Mega Salamence to still naturally outspeed Modest Lunala and Adamant Rayquaza. However, do keep in mind that this spread heavily decreases Mega Salamence's natural damage output.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>There will be situations where having access to Salamence's Intimidate for more than a single use can come in handy, so it's possible to stay in Salamence's base forme by coming in on a physical attacker to activate Intimidate and doubling out to another Pokemon on a predicted switch. However, never attack with a Salamence that has not Mega Evolved yet unless the foe is in range of being knocked out and when regular Salamence can outspeed whatever is in front of it, as its damage output is nonexistent due to not having STAB on Double-Edge and Facade.</li> <li>Mega Salamence serves as a good switch-in for Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Primal Groudon, Mega Scizor, and Mega Lucario. Mega Salamence can potentially bait these Pokemon into switching out to gain a setup opportunity or to begin whittling down its checks.</li> <li>Pinpoint the correct time to start setting up with Dragon Dance. Mega Salamence prefers to start setting up when its checks and counters either are in range of being knocked out by its boosted attacks or have already been knocked out previously. If nearly all members of the opposing team are still healthy, it's better to just start attacking with Double-Edge straight away, which aids in wearing down Mega Salamence's switch-ins.</li> <li>If Mega Salamence aims to become statused to boost Facade's power, stay away from paralysis at all costs. Pokemon like Glare Zygarde-C and Nuzzle Smeargle can cripple Mega Salamence's Speed stat to prevent a Dragon Dance sweep from ever happening, and Mega Gengar can trap it and knock it out with Hex. Try to have Mega Salamence burned, if possible, since burn's residual damage is much lower than Toxic's, but keep in mind that Double-Edge and Earthquake's damage output is reduced in this state.</li> <li>Be wary of Pokemon that can potentially use Ice-type attacks, such as Hidden Power Ice Primal Groudon and Marshadow as well as Ice Beam Lunala, Mewtwo, and Deoxys-A.</li> <li>If an opposing Pokemon is in range of being knocked out by Facade or Earthquake, use them over Double-Edge in this situation to prevent Mega Salamence from taking unnecessary recoil damage. This may prolong Mega Salamence's sweep by an extra turn or two.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Necrozma-DM is an excellent check to Xerneas, Arceus-Water, and Arceus-Fairy, which are Pokemon that Mega Salamence typically struggles with. Necrozma-DM can even take on support Arceus-Ground as long as it remains healthy, as Judgment fails to 2HKO specially defensive sets. It also has the ability to set up Stealth Rock, which helps Mega Salamence pick up necessary OHKOs and 2HKOs, and can cripple some of the checks that it shares with Mega Salamence, such as Giratina-O and Mega Slowbro, with Toxic. In turn, Mega Salamence checks Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon, two Pokemon that Necrozma-DM generally tries to avoid staying in on.</li> <li>Gothitelle makes for a phenomenal partner due to its ability to trap many of the bulkier threats that give Mega Salamence trouble. Passive Pokemon such as Skarmory, Lugia, support Necrozma-DM, Celesteela, and support Arceus formes, other than Arceus-Dark, are vulnerable to Gothitelle's ability to PP stall their moves with a combination of Charm, Confide, Taunt, and Rest, which eventually gives Mega Salamence more breathing room to set up with Dragon Dance, especially when running Substitute.</li> <li>Primal Groudon can utilize its Fire- and Ground-type attacks to obliterate the many Steel-type Pokemon that check Mega Salamence, such as Celesteela, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Necrozma-DM, and Magearna. It can also come in on Xerneas and Primal Kyogre, set up Stealth Rock, phaze with Roar or Dragon Tail, and whittle down bulky Pokemon with Toxic. Offensive sets are also nice when paired with Mega Salamence, as both Pokemon are able to whittle down their shared checks together. Mixed Rock Polish Primal Groudon is known to run Hidden Power Ice to smack Zygarde-C, which is a threat that normally switches into both it and Mega Salamence comfortably.</li> <li>Xerneas appreciates Mega Salamence's ability to check Ho-Oh, Mega Scizor, and Primal Groudon, while it takes advantage of Zygarde-C and support Arceus formes to use them as setup fodder for a Geomancy sweep.</li> <li>On hyper offense teams, suicide hazard leads such as Deoxys-S, Smeargle, Excadrill, and Cloyster are invaluable in helping Mega Salamence set up a sweep. Excadrill, Smeargle, and Cloyster are known for utilizing Rapid Spin to remove opposing hazards, while Deoxys-S is fast enough to shut down most hazard setters and hazard removers with Taunt.</li> <li>Support Arceus formes such as Arceus-Fairy, Arceus-Water, and Arceus-Ground make for great partners for Mega Salamence thanks to them having the bulk to withstand certain attacks that are aimed for Mega Salamence. Arceus-Fairy switches in on Hidden Power Ice Marshadow, Arceus-Ground can come in on Mega Diancie and Dialga, and Arceus-Water can pivot in on an Ice Beam from Primal Kyogre. Arceus-Water and Arceus-Ground can also reliably use Defog to remove Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Mega Salamence appreciates wallbreakers that punch holes into, or remove, its checks and counters. Bulk Up Marshadow, Calm Mind Lunala, Deoxys-A, Primal Kyogre, Rayquaza, and Life Orb Yveltal deal massive amounts of damage to a majority of the tier, which is something Mega Salamence can take advantage of with a Dragon Dance sweep later in the game.</li> </ul> "

        "name": "Offensive Defog",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Defog clears entry hazards, such as Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Sticky Web, off of the field.</li> <li>Double-Edge is Mega Salamence's primary offensive option and is capable of OHKOing Mega Lucario, 2HKOing fast support Arceus formes after Stealth Rock, and 2HKOing Gothitelle even if Charm is used before the second attack.</li> <li>Roost provides Mega Salamence with a reliable recovery move, which helps it sustain itself and clear entry hazards with Defog throughout the match.</li> <li>Facade enables Mega Salamence to benefit from a usually crippling burn status, which is typically inflicted by Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh. Once boosted by a status condition, Facade becomes stronger than Double-Edge.</li> <li>Toxic can cripple many of Mega Salamence's usual checks, such as Lugia, support Arceus formes, Mega Slowbro, and Giratina-O.</li> <li>Dragon Dance can give Mega Salamence some extra role compression, turning it into a hazard remover and a sweeper at the same time. However, such a set is worn down very easily by Toxic and increased Double-Edge recoil when its team needs a healthy hazard remover, and a mono-attacking Jolly Mega Salamence that is trying to sweep has a tougher time getting past its Steel-type checks without Earthquake.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Salamencite is required to enable Salamence's Mega Evolution.</li> <li>A Jolly nature and 252 Speed EVs are used to Speed tie with Arceus and outpace everything slower, which gives Mega Salamence more room to get a Defog off versus most of the unboosted metagame.</li> <li>252 Attack EVs enable Mega Salamence to hit as hard as possible.</li> <li>An Adamant nature could be used for more power, but the loss in Speed can be detrimental when going up against Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Ground, which will always outspeed and OHKO Mega Salamence rather than Speed tying.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Use Defog to clear the field of any and all entry hazards and the rare screens.</li> <li>Sometimes, keeping Salamence in its base forme can be a good idea to use Intimidate more than once against physical attackers. Regular Salamence can even use Defog on a predicted switch or against Primal Groudon, but it should never attack in this state, as Double-Edge and Facade do minimal damage without Aerilate.</li> <li>If running Toxic, try to predict whether a Pokemon such as a support Arceus forme or Giratina-O is coming in to cripple them on the switch.</li> <li>Try to keep this variant of Mega Salamence away from status conditions. Mega Gengar traps, outspeeds, and knocks a statused Mega Salamence out with Hex after Stealth Rock. Toxic makes it harder for Mega Salamence to sustain itself, and burn weakens all of Mega Salamence's attacks other than Facade, which can render Mega Salamence setup fodder. Paralysis and sleep should be avoided at all costs even if Facade is being used, as these status ailments leave Mega Salamence prone to being revenge killed or used as setup fodder, respectively.</li> <li>There's no need to use Double-Edge when a target is in range of being knocked out by Facade or Toxic's residual damage. It's best to try to preserve Mega Salamence's HP by any means necessary so it can keep using Defog and checking various Pokemon for a longer period of time, and mindlessly clicking Double-Edge when there's no reason to do so will inflict unnecessary harm onto Mega Salamence.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Support Necrozma-DM is arguably the tier's best answer to Xerneas, Lugia, Deoxys-A, Mega Slowbro, and support Arceus. With its defensive typing that gives it resistances to Fairy- and Ice-type attacks while rendering it immune to Toxic, Necrozma-DM can comfortably switch into all of these Pokemon and threaten to status them back with its own Toxic, and it can also set up Stealth Rock, which helps Mega Salamence pick up a necessary 2HKO versus Arceus-Fairy with Double-Edge.</li> <li>With Mega Salamence playing the role of an entry hazard remover, support Arceus formes are free to use a different move in place of Defog. Arceus-Fairy can use Stealth Rock to threaten out common hazard control Pokemon such as Giratina-O, Mega Sableye, and opposing Mega Salamence, while Arceus-Water and Arceus-Ground have the freedom to use Toxic alongside Judgment and Ice Beam.</li> <li>When not running Facade, this Mega Salamence set appreciates status absorbers and clerics. Gothitelle runs Rest to rid itself of status conditions and has the ability to trap, weaken, and PP stall many of Mega Salamence's checks. Defensive Xerneas runs Rest alongside Aromatherapy and Sleep Talk to not only absorb and heal status conditions for itself but also get rid of its teammates' status ailments. Defensive Xerneas also has the bulk to withstand attacks from Marshadow, a Pokemon that threatens Mega Salamence with Hidden Power Ice. Lastly, Magearna has the option to run Heal Bell while acting as a switch-in to opposing Xerneas.</li> <li>Primal Groudon's powerful Fire- and Ground-type STAB combination enables it to incinerate the majority of Mega Salamence's Steel- and Rock-type checks, and it can comfortably come in on Primal Kyogre's Ice Beam and Xerneas's Moonblast. Primal Groudon can also lure in some of the checks that it shares with Mega Salamence, such as Lugia, Arceus-Water, Arceus-Ground, and Giratina-O, and cripple them with Toxic or use Overheat or Eruption against Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>Marshadow is an excellent partner that can revenge kill Mega Gengar, Necrozma-DM, Ultra Necrozma, Deoxys-A, and Mewtwo, and its Bulk Up Marshadium Z set is one of the few setup sweepers in the tier that can reliably break Iron Defense Mega Slowbro thanks to Spectral Thief stealing the Defense boosts.</li> </ul> "

        "name": "Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Body Slam is this set’s main attacking move. It OHKOes Marshadow and Mega Blaziken and 2HKOes Deoxys-S without any investment, letting Mega Salamence potentially prevent the latter from setting any entry hazards. The paralysis chance deters support Arceus formes and Necrozma-DM from freely switching into this set and can also come in handy for slowing down setup sweepers like Rock Polish Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Defog removes entry hazards for Mega Salamence's team and is one of the main draws of this set over defensive Zygarde-C. Mega Salamence is a good Defogger because of its favorable matchup against Primal Groudon, high Speed, and immunity to Sticky Web.</li> <li>Roost provides Mega Salamence with a reliable recovery move so it can repeatedly switch into the Pokemon that it checks and use Defog throughout the match.</li> <li>Refresh allows Mega Salamence to remove burn and poison status afflicted by Ho-Oh, Primal Groudon, and Necrozma-DM that would normally cripple it. It allows this set to consistently switch into and remove hazards from defensive Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Dragon Tail phazes setup sweepers that aren't Fairy-types, such as Zygarde-C and opposing Mega Salamence; it always breaks the Substitute of Zygarde-C lacking defensive investment. Dragon Tail also allows Mega Salamence to avoid being trapped by Gothitelle, as this variant lacks the offensive prowess to muscle past it if Gothitelle is given a free switch.</li> <li>Facade is an option over Body Slam if Refresh isn't used. This still allows Mega Salamence to act as a status sponge but doesn't hand over free turns to the opponent like using Refresh does. In particular, a burn status inflicted by Ho-Oh or Giratina now benefits Mega Salamence instead of hindering it. A status-boosted Facade is strong enough to 2HKO Primal Groudon and defensive Ho-Oh after some prior damage and force recovery options from support Arceus formes. However, Body Slam is generally preferred because of the paralysis chance.</li> <li>Toxic cripples support Arceus formes and Lugia and puts setup sweepers on a timer, but these Pokemon don't appreciate a paralysis from Body Slam anyway, and it has no effect on the Steel-types that tend to switch into Mega Salamence.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Salamencite is required to Mega Evolve into Mega Salamence.</li> <li>124 Speed EVs ensure that Mega Salamence outspeeds maximum base 90 Speed Pokemon, such as Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and Ho-Oh.</li> <li>The rest of the EVs are placed into HP and Defense alongside an Impish nature, granting Mega Salamence very respectable physical bulk. This set survives a +1 Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike and two Life Orb-boosted Rock Tombs from Marshadow and fully heals off the damage from Life Orb Ho-Oh's Brave Bird with Roost.</li> <li>Intimidate further bolsters this bulk by lowering the foe's Attack stat by one stage. After Intimidate, Mega Salamence survives even boosted Stone Edge from Primal Groudon and can fish for paralysis with Body Slam or phaze it with Dragon Tail.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Switch Mega Salamence into Pokemon that it checks such as Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Marshadow. Use the opportunity to remove entry hazards with Defog or try to paralyze something with Body Slam.</li> <li>If possible, scout for the opponent's set before switching Mega Salamence in. It can be OHKOed by Hidden Power Ice from Primal Groudon and Life Orb Marshadow and will lose to Primal Groudon if it switches in on a full-powered Eruption. On the other hand, it can very freely come in on defensive variants of Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh, since it shuts down all of their options.</li> <li>If Mega Salamence is afflicted with status, use Refresh to cure it as soon as possible. Status greatly compromises Mega Salamence's ability to switch into threats, as it cannot Roost to heal damage from their attacks and use Refresh simultaneously.</li> <li>Although Mega Salamence matches up favorably against Primal Groudon, it loses to many other common hazard setters including Arceus-Fairy, Arceus-Ground, Necrozma-DM, and Ferrothorn. Pack a secondary Defogger like Ho-Oh to deal with these Pokemon or try to remove them from play before attempting to Defog.</li> <li>Sometimes, keeping Salamence in its base forme can be a good idea to use Intimidate more than once against physical attackers. Regular Salamence can even use Defog on a predicted switch or against Primal Groudon, but it should rarely attack in this state, as Body Slam does minimal damage without Aerilate.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Defensive Mega Salamence fits on teams that are looking for a sturdy check to physical attackers like Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Marshadow. The main advantages it has over defensive Zygarde-C are access to Defog, higher Speed, the ability to recover health without being forced to use Rest, and an immunity to Ground and grounded entry hazards.</li> <li>Steel-types synergize well with Mega Salamence, as they cover its weaknesses to Rock, Ice, and Fairy while Mega Salamence resists Fire, Fighting, and Ground. Necrozma-DM and Magearna can reliably handle special attackers like Xerneas and Deoxys-A that threaten Mega Salamence, while Mega Salamence can deal with Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh for them. Ferrothorn, while not a check to Geomancy Xerneas, can take advantage of common switch-ins to Mega Salamence like support Arceus formes, support Necrozma-DM, and Lugia by using them as opportunities to set Spikes.</li> <li>Arceus-Water is an ideal defensive partner for Mega Salamence. Pokemon such as mixed Rock Polish Primal Groudon, Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, and Kyurem-W carry coverage moves that allow them to hit both Mega Salamence and Steel-types, and Arceus-Water's good bulk and defensive typing allow it to handle these threats with ease. Primal Kyogre can also check the aforementioned threats; it's more effective than Arceus-Water as a check to Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, but will take a lot of damage from Primal Groudon unless it is running a defensive set.</li> <li>Ho-Oh is another Pokemon that checks the aforementioned special attackers, and it appreciates the Defog support that Mega Salamence provides. It can deal with many Pokemon that threaten Mega Salamence such as Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Fairy, and Hidden Power Ice variants of Marshadow and Primal Groudon while also putting pressure on Steel-types for it.</li> <li>Ground-types like Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground can put pressure on the Rock- and Steel-types that wall Mega Salamence. Primal Groudon also checks Fairy-types and can set Stealth Rock for Mega Salamence's team.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy and Choice Scarf Xerneas benefit from Mega Salamence's ability to check Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh. In return, they can switch into Dragon-type attacks for it and deal with Hidden Power Ice variants of Marshadow.</li> <li>Slow wallbreakers like Calm Mind Primal Kyogre, Eruption Primal Groudon, and Choice Band Ho-Oh can take advantage of the paralysis that Mega Salamence inflicts with Body Slam.</li> </ul> "

  "Metagross": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Mega Metagross is a marginally decent Steel-type that cannot find a place on any competitive team in Ubers. Almost every set it attempts to run is utterly outclassed by other Steel-types in both offensive and defensive aspects.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM's presence in the tier invalidates any attempt that Mega Metagross makes to perform a specific role. Necrozma-DM's access to Prism Armor and recovery makes it a far better check to Xerneas, Deoxys-A, and support Arceus formes, and such tools also help it perform much better as a Stealth Rock user. Offensively, Necrozma-DM can utilize various setup moves and Ultra Burst to overcome its shortcomings from low Speed and mediocre coverage, and Mega Metagross struggles to mimic any of these.</li> <li>There are also better Pokemon to use when attempting to make a use of Mega Metagross's Speed or access to Bullet Punch. Mega Lucario has much narrower counterplay under appropriate team support, and already niche Arceus-Steel has a better chance to pose a threat to offensive teams with better bulk and Speed.</li> <li>To only worsen this, using Mega Metagross prevents the use of other Mega Evolutions on the team, meaning Pokemon like Mega Salamence can't cover Steel-types' weaknesses against Primal Groudon and other Ground-types, and Mega Gengar cannot trap and remove problematic foes. The fact that Mega Metagross is walled by more Pokemon than it can defeat and is forced out by more Pokemon that it can switch into also serves to hinder the team's overall quality.</li> <li>The only way to somewhat salvage Mega Metagross is by taking advantage of its somewhat decent movepool and Speed, access to Bullet Punch, and ability to switch into Moonblast from Xerneas. This means Mega Metagross can be best used as a physical attacker that won't be too easy to take on by slower Pokemon and can offensively and defensively handle Xerneas. Keep in mind that none of these factors are sufficient to justify Mega Metagross's serious use.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Mega Metagross has wide offensive movepool, and it may be tempting to use attacks like Hammer Arm to punish Ferrothorn and Pursuit to remove Deoxys-A from play. However, these moves have a very shallow pool of Pokemon that Mega Metagross cannot already hit hard. It is better to use Necrozma-DM to overpower defensive Steel-types, and even a niche Pursuit trapping strategy is performed much better by Mega Scizor.</li> <li>Toxic puts switch-ins like Primal Groudon and Arceus formes on a timer, but this does not improve Mega Metagross's matchup against opposing Steel-types and forces it to forgo one of its coverage moves. Punishing a switch-in with Toxic is done much more successfully by other Pokemon like Ferrothorn.</li> <li>Steel-types commonly tend to run Stealth Rock to alleviate Primal Groudon of its role in certain teams, but Mega Metagross performs terribly against just about every entry hazard remover in the tier. Stealth Rock and Explosion may sound like a usable set to use on Sticky Web teams, but this is completely outclassed by Mega Diancie, as Mega Metagross's defensive presence becomes virtually meaningless because it will have to sacrifice itself to prevent Defog, while Mega Diancie can directly threaten Defog users like Giratina-O and Ho-Oh and utilize an excellent ability in Magic Bounce.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Ferrothorn and Skarmory do not mind Mega Metagross at all and can easily set Spikes on it. Necrozma-DM avoids being 2HKOed by Earthquake and can use Mega Metagross as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Primal Groudon doesn't like being worn down by repeated attacks, but it avoids being 2HKOed by Earthquake and can easily shut down any Mega Metagross lacking said attack. It can easily OHKO Mega Metagross with one of its STAB moves or set up Stealth Rock against it. Ho-Oh can be problematic if Mega Metagross lacks Rock Slide, as defensive variants are not 2HKOed by Thunder Punch, and Choice Scarf variants can outspeed and pick off damaged Mega Metagross.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Ground</strong>: Arceus-Ground's bulk and higher Speed make it a solid offensive check to Mega Metagross. Offensive sets using Swords Dance or Calm Mind can set up on Mega Metagross with Recover.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Arceus-Water is impossible for Mega Metagross to break through on its own, as it is not even 2HKOed by Thunder Punch. Primal Kyogre can win against Mega Metagross in a one-on-one situation, and special variants can easily score an OHKO with Origin Pulse.</p> <p><strong>Dark- and Ghost-types: Though Mega Metagross can hit foes like Yveltal and Giratina-O decently hard with appropriate moves, they aren't 2HKOed without prior damage and can retaliate with their own moves. Arceus-Dark, Mega Sableye, and defensive Lunala are more problematic due to their access to recovery moves. Marshadow is not OHKOed by any move and can easily defeat Mega Metagross with a combination of Spectral Thief and Shadow Sneak. Mega Gengar can't switch into Mega Metagross, but it can trap and remove it with Will-O-Wisp followed by Hex or Shadow Ball if Mega Metagross has been weakened.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Meteor Mash's high damage output against Fairy-types assists in offensively checking them with help from Bullet Punch.</li> <li>Access to Ice Punch sets Mega Metagross apart from other Steel-types. Unlike other Steel-types, Mega Metagross can swiftly remove Mega Salamence with Ice Punch instead of merely switching into it. More importantly, Mega Metagross becomes more hazardous for Zygarde to take advantage of.</li> <li>Rock Slide prevents Ho-Oh from easily shutting down this set by allowing Mega Metagross to OHKO it after Stealth Rock damage.</li> <li>Thunder Punch can be opted for instead of Rock Slide, trading Mega Metagross's ability to pressure Ho-Oh with a better matchup against Primal Kyogre. However, Thunder Punch's inability to 2HKO Arceus-Water and defensive Ho-Oh and Primal Kyogre's greater susceptibility to repeated damage make it a far less ideal option than Rock Slide.</li> <li>Bullet Punch picks off weakened foes like Geomancy Xerneas. With this move, Mega Metagross becomes an improved check to Fairy-types that can switch into them and still do sizable damage to them when at low health.</li> <li>Earthquake can be considered to hit Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM hard on the switch, but neither of them is 2HKOed from full health.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>176 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Mega Metagross to outspeed everything up to maximum base 100 Speed Pokemon. The investment makes it harder for Yveltal to recklessly take on Mega Metagross should it lack Choice Scarf and enables Mega Metagross to make the first move against the less common Palkia, Mega Kangaskhan, and Mega Blaziken.</li> <li>232 HP EVs and 40 Special Defense EVs combine to help Mega Metagross survive a hit from boosted Geomancy Xerneas after a layer of Spikes. This EV spread also allows Mega Metagross to survive three Moonblasts from Xerneas and a Shadow Ball from Mega Gengar from full health.</li> <li>The remainder of the EVs are invested in Attack to improve the odds that Geomancy Xerneas will be taken out by Bullet Punch after taking an uninvested Precipice Blades from Primal Groudon.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Mega Metagross will typically pivot into Xerneas, as Xerneas struggles to immediately overpower a healthy Mega Metagross. Mega Metagross is also a blanket check to Deoxys-A and Arceus-Fairy, but the latter can cripple Mega Metagross with Will-O-Wisp or surprise it with Fire Blast when weakened enough.</li> <li>What makes it very difficult to make the most use of Mega Metagross is the fact that it will often hand over the momentum to its switch-in after entering the field. Threatening Pokemon like Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM can switch into a weak attack and essentially gain a free turn, and it will be impossible for Mega Metagross to weaken Ferrothorn or Arceus-Water. This means Mega Metagross will lack a move to hit its switch-in against a lot of teams, and even if it does, it will have to make a correct prediction to 2HKO foes like Ho-Oh and slightly weakened Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Arceus-Water, Arceus-Ground, and Arceus-Dark are forced to recover if Mega Metagross hits them with the right move, and Arceus-Fairy lacking moves to deal with Steel-types can be an opportunity for Mega Metagross to be more useful. It is also worth noting that Extreme Killer Arceus has only a very slim chance to defeat Mega Metagross in a one-on-one situation, so a healthy Mega Metagross can also be somewhat of an insurance against it.</li> <li>As this set's entire purpose is to maximize Mega Metagross's offensive coverage, an opponent may end up with a false sense of security that it will lack a coverage move to hit certain Pokemon. Should Pokemon like Zygarde and Ho-Oh start to directly switch into Mega Metagross around mid-game, be quick to surprise and punish them with appropriate moves. Revealing these moves too early can ruin the surprise factor, so be patient until said foes end up falling to the trap.</li> <li>There is a ray of hope for Mega Metagross against offensive teams as well. Due to its Speed, slightly weakened Primal Groudon and physical Primal Kyogre can be much shakier checks to Mega Metagross with appropriate moves. While they can check Necrozma-DM as long as they successfully switch in, Mega Metagross outspeeds them and 2HKOes them on the switch. Yveltal lacking Choice Scarf is also not entirely safe from Mega Metagross for this reason. Said foes are typically offensive checks to Steel-types, or Necrozma-DM in Yveltal's case, and they can be pressured and surmounted with Stealth Rock support and predictions.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Mega Metagross draws in a lot of undesirable foes, but this also means it will cause switches. Thus, entry hazard support is needed for Mega Metagross to not pivot into attacks and gradually lose its health. Primal Groudon can set Stealth Rock and pivot into Steel-types that attempt to take advantage of Mega Metagross, and support Arceus formes can set the said entry hazard and help to reduce the damage caused by Primal Groudon or Necrozma-DM that switches into Mega Metagross depending on their typing.</li> <li>Entry hazard removers are also needed, as many Pokemon that check Mega Metagross can set them. Giratina-O is a reliable way to deal with Primal Groudon that can capitalize on Mega Metagross lacking Earthquake, and Ho-Oh can take on many support Arceus formes and force out Ferrothorn.</li> <li>Dark-types like Yveltal and Arceus-Dark appreciate Mega Metagross's defensive presence against Fairy-types, and they can offensively handle Giratina-O and some Necrozma-DM variants.</li> <li>Among Dark-types, Yveltal can be particularly helpful due to its ability to compensate for Mega Metagross's vulnerability against Ghost- and Ground-types and a disappointing matchup against defensive teams. Yveltal can run generic offensive or even stallbreaker sets to break through defensive teams, and Mega Metagross can check Fairy-types and potentially lure in Ho-Oh and punish it with Rock Slide.</li> <li>Pokemon that can cover Dark-types are also necessary, and Arceus-Dark can do this reasonably well, though Xerneas is more of a reliable option. Arceus-Fairy may sound like an acceptable choice, but note that it will be an additional Pokemon vulnerable to Mega Gengar, and its Stealth Rock support is meaningless if opposing Ho-Oh has Defog.</li> <li>Gothitelle or Gothorita can be considered to trap and neutralize Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and support Arceus formes that easily shut down Mega Metagross.</li> </ul> "

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Mega Latias has a niche as a check to Primal Groudon that has access to both Defog and Healing Wish, allowing it to provide powerful support to bulky offense teams. Healing Wish in particular can grant offensive threats a second chance to sweep, which sets Mega Latias apart from its competitors such as Mega Salamence, Giratina-O, and Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>Solid mixed bulk and the immunities and resistances granted by its typing and ability mean it can switch into both physical and special sets of Primal Groudon and use Defog to remove Stealth Rock or whittle down Primal Groudon with Toxic and attacks.</li> <li>Though using Mega Latias means that other powerful Mega Evolutions cannot be used on its team, it allows greater freedom in choosing the role of the team's Arceus forme, as Mega Latias utilizes Defog and checks Primal Groudon, a role that support Arceus formes typically perform.</li> <li>However, it is heavily threatened by many strong offensive threats such as Necrozma-DM, Yveltal, and Xerneas, often granting them a free turn to switch in and set up or fire off powerful attacks.</li> <li>Due to its reliance on Toxic for damage, Mega Latias also poses no threat to many support Pokemon that are immune to Toxic and are not weak to its attacking moves such as Ferrothorn and Celesteela, giving them free turns to support their team.</li> <li>Mega Latias is unable to effectively keep Stealth Rock off the field against common Stealth Rock setters such as Necrozma-DM and Arceus-Fairy, and it struggles against Primal Groudon carrying Toxic or Dragon-type coverage.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Mega Latias has a large range of support moves, but choosing to run any of them over its standard moveset requires giving up a valuable moveslot, greatly diminishing Mega Latias's effectiveness at checking the threats it is supposed to check or giving up its niche of having both Defog and Healing Wish.</li> <li>Running both Recover and Healing Wish by giving up Toxic is a possibility, but this is counterproductive because Recover is a move that attempts to give Mega Latias longevity, while Healing Wish fits best on teams that do not care about staying power.</li> <li>Refresh allows Mega Latias to easily take on Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground that carry Toxic and generally act as a status absorber.</li> <li>Role Play can be run to escape trappers by copying their Shadow Tag, allowing Mega Latias to switch out. However, Mega Gengar can use Taunt or KO Mega Latias on the turn it uses the move, meaning that in practice, its use is limited to escaping only Gothitelle.</li> <li>Roar is an option to rack up entry hazard damage and force out setup sweepers to remove their boosts; however, this is only a short-term solution, as they can easily come in afterwards and threaten to set up again.</li> <li>Reflect and Light Screen can help Mega Latias and its teammates take powerful physical or special attacks better and aid sweepers in setting up, but they can be removed through Defog and only last for 5 turns because Mega Latias cannot hold Light Clay.</li> <li>Tailwind can allow slower, powerful attackers such as Primal Kyogre to outspeed their offensive checks and clean weakened teams, but it practically only lasts for two turns.</li> <li>Thunder Wave is an alternative status move that can cripple faster threats but does not affect Ground-types, which Mega Latias is supposed to check.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor are immune to Toxic and take little damage from Mega Latias's attacks. In return, they can threaten to sweep with boosting moves, fire off powerful attacks, support their team through status moves, or set up entry hazards, which Mega Latias cannot remove due to it being unable to threaten them out. However, Steel-types may find themselves setup fodder for one of Mega Latias's teammates should Mega Latias choose to use Healing Wish.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Yveltal can threaten to OHKO Mega Latias with Dark-type STAB moves or maintain momentum with U-turn while still dealing considerable chip damage should Mega Latias choose to stay in. Arceus-Dark can set up Calm Mind on Mega Latias while shrugging off Toxic with Refresh or simply smack it with its super effective Judgment or Toxic. Mega Sableye can recover off any direct damage Mega Latias deals, bounces back Toxic so that Mega Latias cannot freely throw around status, and threatens Mega Latias with Toxic or Foul Play. Alolan Muk and Tyranitar take little damage from Mega Latias's direct attacks and can heavily damage Mega Latias as it attempts to switch out with Pursuit. Tyranitar can also set up Stealth Rock, which Mega Latias cannot safely clear away, but it must be wary of Toxic, which can quickly wear it down if it is not carrying Rest.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Xerneas, Arceus-Fairy, Mega Diancie, and Magearna can heavily damage or KO Mega Latias with their super effective STAB moves. Additionally, Xerneas can threaten to set up Geomancy or use a free turn to use Aromatherapy, while Arceus-Fairy and Mega Diancie can set up Stealth Rock in front of Mega Latias, and Magearna can support its team through Heal Bell or maintain momentum through Volt Switch. Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy must be wary of switching into a potential Toxic, however. Additionally, Fairy-types may find themselves setup fodder for one of Mega Latias's teammates should Mega Latias choose to use Healing Wish.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Marshadow can easily OHKO Mega Latias with its Ghost-type STAB moves, use Pursuit if Mega Latias attempts to switch out, or set up a Bulk Up on a forced switch. Similarly, Arceus-Ghost can force out Mega Latias with its super effective STAB moves and set up Swords Dance. Lunala and Necrozma-DW threaten to OHKO Mega Latias with Moongeist Beam or use Mega Latias as setup fodder. None appreciate switching into Toxic, however, as it quickly wears them down and breaks Lunala's Shadow Shield.</p> <p><strong>Shadow Tag: Mega Gengar and Gothitelle are both able to trap Mega Latias with Shadow Tag. Although it has to be wary of a potential Draco Meteor, Mega Gengar can pick off Mega Latias with a super effective Shadow Ball or Hex. Gothitelle takes little damage from any of Mega Latias's attacks, can remove poison with Rest, and proceeds to PP stall Mega Latias's attacks so that Taunt forces it to use Struggle or so another threat can set up. Mega Latias can, however, use Healing Wish to disrupt a trapping attempt by allowing a powerful offensive teammate to come in and threaten to set up unexpectedly.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey</strong>: Chansey and Blissey can easily switch into any common move Mega Latias carries due to their immense special bulk and Natural Cure. They can then proceed to spread Toxic, support their team with Wish or Heal Bell, or set Stealth Rock, which Mega Latias cannot effectively remove. However, Chansey and Blissey may find themselves as setup fodder for one of Mega Latias's teammates if it chooses to use Healing Wish to bring them in.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh does not appreciate being hit with Toxic, but it can take any other move Mega Latias carries due to its high special bulk and retaliate with a Toxic of its own or fire off a powerful Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Although Mega Latias shrugs off Hidden Power Ice, Primal Groudon can surprise Mega Latias by running Dragon Tail, Dragon Claw, or Dragon Pulse, making Mega Latias a much less reliable switch-in. Though Mega Latias resists Psychic, Psychic-types such as Deoxys-A and Mega Mewtwo Y typically carry Ice Beam, which 2HKOes Mega Latias. Mega Latias is often unable to OHKO in return due to Deoxys-A's Focus Sash and Mega Mewtwo Y's special bulk.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types: Mega Latias is unable to use Defog against Cloyster's hazards due to the threat of getting OHKOed by Icicle Spear. Kyurem-W can also threaten to OHKO Mega Latias with its super effective STAB moves, although it fears a possible Draco Meteor.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Although Mega Latias can threaten to OHKO or deal heavy damage to many Dragon-types if running Draco Meteor, faster Dragon-types such as Naganadel and Choice Scarf users can OHKO Mega Latias before it can retaliate. Additionally, Dialga can tank Mega Latias's Draco Meteor thanks to its Steel typing and OHKO with its own.</p> <p><strong>Status: Toxic is commonly carried by Stealth Rock Primal Groudon. Toxic damage quickly wears Mega Latias down if not carrying Recover or Refresh, and if it does run either move, Toxic forces it to play predictably and heal itself. Paralysis from Thunder Wave and Glare means that Mega Latias is outsped by many threats it needs to be faster than to check, such as Swords Dance Primal Groudon, and makes it less reliable due to the chance of getting fully paralyzed.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: If Mega Latias is not carrying Grass Knot, Primal Kyogre can easily take Draco Meteor due to its high special bulk. Specially offensive sets 2HKO Mega Latias with Ice Beam, while defensive sets cure Toxic with Rest and threaten Mega Latias with either Ice Beam or Toxic. Physically offensive Kyogre sets struggle to deal with Mega Latias, however, as Ice Beam does not 2HKO.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Defog is mandatory, allowing Mega Latias to support its team by removing entry hazards. It is especially effective on Mega Latias, as it checks Primal Groudon, the most common Stealth Rock user in the tier, though it must be wary of Toxic.</li> <li>Toxic is Mega Latias's best method of dealing damage, crippling bulky support Pokemon such as Arceus-Ground and putting offensive Pokemon on a timer.</li> <li>Healing Wish allows Mega Latias to restore an ally to full health once it is no longer required, working well with sweepers such as Double Dance Primal Groudon, which can wear down or KO its own checks before being restored to full health to sweep. This combination is especially effective because many sweepers can set up on the Pokemon that Mega Latias invites in.</li> <li>Alternatively, Recover can be used to allow Mega Latias to stay healthy throughout the match and continue to use Defog. However, this requires giving up Healing Wish, which makes Mega Latias outclassed by Giratina-O and Mega Salamence.</li> <li>An attacking move is required to immediately damage the threats Mega Latias is supposed to check, since Mega Latias would be too passive otherwise.</li> <li>Draco Meteor is Mega Latias's strongest move against neutral targets and allows it to heavily damage or OHKO Dragon-types such as Mega Salamence and Zygarde-C. However, the Special Attack drop means that Mega Latias will be unable to deal consistent damage and may be forced to switch out.</li> <li>Grass Knot allows Mega Latias to stand up to offensive Primal Kyogre and maximum HP Arceus-Ground, having a good chance to 2HKO both after Stealth Rock damage, but leaves Mega Latias unable to threaten Dragon-types.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>The given EVs and nature allow Mega Latias to outspeed all Pokemon up to and including fully invested base 100 Speed Pokemon. Most importantly, this allows Mega Latias to use Defog or Healing Wish before Yveltal can use Taunt or KO it and ensures it outspeeds Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Rayquaza, Kyurem-W, and Palkia.</li> <li>252 HP EVs maximize Mega Latias's bulk, especially due to its comparatively lower HP stat.</li> <li>4 Special Defense EVs ensure that an uninvested Ice Beam from Primal Kyogre will never 2HKO Mega Latias from full health without a critical hit.</li> <li>The rest of the EVs are placed in Defense to better tank powerful physical attacks like +2 Stone Edge from Primal Groudon.</li> <li>A slower EV spread of 252 HP / 156 Def / 4 SpD / 96 Spe with a Timid nature can be used to increase physical bulk while still outspeeding base 90 Speed Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 116 Def / 4 SpD / 136 Spe with a Timid Nature allows Mega Latias to outspeed base 95 Speed Pokemon like Rayquaza and Kyurem-W.</li> <li>A fully defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Bold nature or 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 SpD with a Calm nature can be used to maximize bulk. However, this requires Mega Latias to give up its valuable Speed tier, meaning it may not be able to use Defog or Healing Wish against threats it would otherwise outspeed such as Yveltal and can leave it outsped by many threats it needs to be faster than to check such as Swords Dance Primal Groudon.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Switch Mega Latias into the Pokemon it checks, such as Primal Groudon, and remove any entry hazards with Defog.</li> <li>Mega Evolve as soon as possible, as it grants Latias greater bulk and power.</li> <li>Use Healing Wish when the benefits of restoring a teammate to full health outweigh the benefits of keeping Mega Latias in play. Examples include restoring a weakened sweeper to full health if the opponent's team no longer has any checks to it and restoring a teammate such as Magearna in order to prevent a sweep from an opposing Pokemon such as Geomancy Xerneas.</li> <li>If running Healing Wish over Recover, be mindful of Mega Latias's limited health pool. If Mega Latias has too little health remaining to effectively check anything, it may be worth conserving for the sole purpose of Healing Wish.</li> <li>If running Recover, use it throughout the match to stay healthy enough to check what it needs to check. However, be careful about being too predictable with using Recover, as it may allow the opponent to switch in checks without fear of taking damage from an attack or Toxic.</li> <li>If Mega Latias can cripple or heavily damage the opposing Pokemon, or if using Defog or Recover is unnecessary or gives up too much momentum, use Toxic or an attacking move in order to wear down the opposing team and catch potential switch-ins such as Xerneas and Yveltal.</li> <li>Switch Mega Latias out if it finds itself facing one of the many Pokemon that threaten it out, and using Healing Wish is undesirable.</li> <li>If the opposing Stealth Rock setter is a Pokemon that Mega Latias cannot effectively use Defog against, such Necrozma-DM or Arceus-Fairy, it is often a better idea to allow Stealth Rock to remain on your side of the field and attempt to set Stealth Rock on the opposing side of the field with your own Stealth Rock setter. Otherwise, switching Mega Latias in to use Defog will simply result in the opposing Stealth Rock user switching back in to set up Stealth Rock again or your team taking a large amount of unnecessary damage from entry hazards and attacks.</li> <li>Against threats on offensive teams such as Swords Dance Primal Groudon, Mega Latias may be forced to choose between sacrificing itself to clear entry hazards or taking down the opposing Pokemon while being left too low on health to be able to use Defog afterwards. Evaluate whether the entry hazards or the opposing Pokemon poses a greater threat to your team, and act accordingly.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Offensive Pokemon that can take full advantage of Healing Wish heavily benefit from Mega Latias's support. Examples include Double Dance Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM, both of which can set up on many typical switch-ins to Mega Latias.</li> <li>Mega Latias requires teammates that can check Fairy-types, which include Steel-types such as Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn. In return, Mega Latias offers a switch-in to Ground- and Fire-type attacks and Defog support.</li> <li>Fire-types such as Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon also check Fairy-types and threaten out Steel-types, which Mega Latias cannot touch. Ho-Oh heavily appreciates Mega Latias keeping Stealth Rock off the field, and Mega Latias can switch into Ground-type moves for Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Checks to Dark-types are also required. Options include Fairy-types such as Magearna and Xerneas, which value Mega Latias's ability to check Primal Groudon and remove entry hazards.</li> <li>Several Arceus formes that perform poorly as Defoggers or checks to Primal Groudon, such as Arceus-Fairy, Arceus-Rock, and Arceus-Electric, can be run, as Mega Latias can do these duties in their place.</li> <li>A switch-in to Ghost-types, such as Yveltal or Arceus-Dark, is necessary. Additionally, as Marshadow can bypass many conventional Ghost-type checks due to its strong Fighting-type attacks, Pokemon that resist Fighting such as Xerneas and Toxapex can be used to check Marshadow. In return, Mega Latias removes Stealth Rock and checks Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Pursuit support from the likes of Marshadow, Tyranitar, and Alolan Muk can aid Mega Latias against Shadow Tag users and Ghost-types.</li> </ul> "

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Primal Kyogre is one of the best choices for breaking down teams thanks to its raw power, coverage, and ability to attack effectively both physically and specially.</li> <li>It remains effective despite being checked by the popular Primal Groudon. Additionally, the utility of an Overheat switch-in and mixed Rock Polish Primal Groudon check is both rare and valuable for offensive teams.</li> <li>Kyogre can also utilize a defensive variant, making it a consideration for nearly every team.</li> <li>Kyogre is a good blanket check for most types of support and Calm Mind Arceus formes.</li> <li>However, Kyogre is naturally slow and has poor options for recovery. It is also forced to use Blue Orb, which denies it the option to address these issues. As a result, Kyogre is easy to weaken and pressure out of a game.</li> <li>Additionally, Kyogre's aforementioned lack of Speed means that one very rarely reaches a gamestate where it, alone, outright wins. This gives it diminishing returns while the game progresses, as the opponent can opt to sacrifice weakened and non-impactful Pokemon instead of trying to guess how Kyogre will attack.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Kyogre can make use of Choice Scarf and Choice Specs in niche situations that take advantage of teams lacking or trapping Primal Groudon, but these sets don't stand out enough from Primal Kyogre sets to warrant usage.</li> <li>Hidden Power Ground is the strongest special move that Kyogre can use versus Primal Groudon, but its extremely narrow coverage makes it mostly inferior to just using Ice Beam.</li> <li>Brick Break is another extremely specialized coverage move that can hit Ferrothorn for super effective damage. However, even sets with heavy Attack investment will still fail to 2HKO after Stealth Rock the majority of the time. The recoil damage from Iron Barbs, the opportunity cost, and the inefficiency in its given niche mean that using Brick Break is a novelty at best.</li> <li>A defensive variant with Liquidation, Earthquake, Rest, and Sleep Talk can be used to have a stronger Primal Groudon matchup. The drawbacks, however, include a much weaker Ferrothorn matchup and the reliance on PP stalling when dealing with Arceus-Water.</li> <li>Blizzard is a stronger Ice Beam, but the horrible accuracy is off-putting, especially for a move that requires consecutive hits.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Primal Groudon is found on nearly every competitive team and can safely switch into Primal Kyogre at least once. Its mere presence can force hesitation from Primal Kyogre when it comes to using its STAB move of choice. If Primal Groudon is faster than Kyogre, it becomes even more difficult for Kyogre to apply meaningful pressure. However, Primal Kyogre has the advantage when it has its own weather in play versus Primal Groudon, especially if it is faster. For this reason, many teams will include a secondary Primal Kyogre check to account for this situation and to force the Primal Kyogre user to be more cautious with its move choices.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn</strong>: Ferrothorn's large mixed bulk, Water-type resistance, lack of weaknesses to Primal Kyogre's coverage options, STAB Power Whip, and access to Spikes make it one of the most consistent and threatening checks to Kyogre. Even Calm Mind + Water Spout sets have to be careful to conserve their HP for as long as Ferrothorn itself is healthy. Other variants must simply avoid being in play as often as possible unless its team has adequate countermeasures for Ferrothorn's Spikes. Power Whip means that an ambitious Kyogre always risks being simply OHKOed after a small amount of prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Water</strong>: Although Arceus-Water runs risks with switching into Kyogre, it often wins the one-on-one matchup when it does manage to come in safely via Toxic followed by Recover stall. However, the Arceus-Water user must be careful to avoid tackling a defensive or Special Attack-invested Kyogre. Even in these matchups, though, Arceus-Water still provides valuable pivoting utility for a Primal Groudon teammate to take advantage of.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Arceus-Grass and Mega Venusaur are far more niche than the Pokemon mentioned above, but their effectiveness in dealing with Primal Kyogre is what solidifies their viability in the Ubers metagame. Their Water-type resistance and STAB Grass-type attacks make to easy for them to switch into and threaten Kyogre. Their access to reliable recovery allows them to play a longer game with Kyogre, and Mega Venusaur even has the advantage of being immune to Toxic. Kyogre's Ice Beam can only help so much versus Mega Venusaur's Thick Fat ability and Arceus-Grass's quick recovery.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Mega Salamence, Rayquaza, and Arceus-Dragon are all acceptable checks to Kyogre when used in conjunction with Primal Groudon. Each of them struggles with Ice Beam due to their double weakness or inability to threaten a quick KO. However, their Water-type resistance and greater Speed make them effective short-term threats.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: In general, the best way to deal with Primal Kyogre is proactively instead of reactively. Faster Pokemon with strong offensive pressure can make it difficult for Kyogre to find an advantageous position from which to apply its pressure. Generally, it is forced to threaten a single trade after careful maneuvers to get in safely. It may not even be able to get this trade, as there is often the threat of Primal Groudon simply switching in.</p> <p><strong>Water-type Answers</strong>: Any Pokemon with a Water-type resistance can serve as a one-time pivot versus Primal Kyogre. Giratina-O, Zekrom, Toxapex, and Mega Slowbro are all Pokemon that could provide this utility if needed. Keep in mind that they aren’t actual Kyogre checks, just tools to help you pivot into a difficult switch-in when the need arises.</p> <p><strong>Palkia: Palkia is a niche Pokemon that can function as a Primal Kyogre check. Switching into Kyogre is fairly easy for it, but it can have difficulties actually threatening Calm Mind Kyogre variants with a clean KO. Kyogre's Earthquake also deals 40% damage minimum to Palkia, which doesn't play well when you're using Primal Groudon as your other Kyogre check.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Pokemon</strong>: Certain defensive Pokemon can win the one-on-one matchup assuming they are healthy due to their incredible natural bulk. Lunala, Lugia, and support Arceus formes can all threaten to Toxic Kyogre and then simply Recover stall. However, this strategy only works for certain Kyogre sets. Chansey and Blissey can check special attacker Kyogre variants, provided they don't use Liquidation, and weakened Calm Mind + Water Spout Kyogre, but they fare poorly versus any other sort of Kyogre.</p> ",

        "name": "Calm Mind + Water Spout",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Full-powered Water Spout has roughly a 25% chance to 2HKO Ferrothorn after Leftovers from full HP. This fact is the key appeal to this Primal Kyogre set, as Ferrothorn is a Pokemon that plagues every other Kyogre variant. Being able to deny Ferrothorn the opportunity to set up Spikes, if not just outright run over it, is very valuable to teams that are unable to afford direct countermeasures to Ferrothorn but are interested in the advantages Kyogre brings to the team.</li> <li>Calm Mind complements Water Spout. You can play mind games with a Ferrothorn that is aiming to use Protect for the extra Leftovers recovery to avoid the Water Spout 2HKO. It also helps Kyogre break other walls like Blissey and Arceus-Water.</li> <li>Origin Pulse allows Kyogre to still functionally pressure teams even when its HP is low or trade with Pokemon that are faster than it. It also cleans up any Pokemon that decided to trade blows with Water Spout.</li> <li>Ice Beam is the best option for getting past Primal Groudon with this Kyogre set. It also complements Kyogre's Water-type STAB moves really well in general; only Arceus-Water, Toxapex, and opposing Kyogre resist both. None of these Pokemon appreciates switching into a full-powered Water Spout anyway. Arceus-Water also cannot do much immediate damage back to Kyogre, so it gets overwhelmed by Calm Mind-boosted attacks.</li> <li>Thunder is an option over Calm Mind if you are especially worried about these Water-types. This hurt the set's overall effectiveness, though, and Thunder's targets are shaky checks in the first place.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Kyogre wants as much firepower as possible for this set in order to break Ferrothorn as reliably as possible. Thus, maximum Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature are strongly recommended.</li> <li>This set wants to avoid trading blows so it can use full-powered Water Spouts. Therefore, running maximum Speed EVs is required. A Timid nature becomes tempting, but the drop in power is very noticeable; most notably, Primal Kyogre loses the chance to 2HKO Ferrothorn without prior damage.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Using Water Spout as Ferrothorn switches in is the surest way to beat it. Calm Mind is a mostly safe middle-ground play if you are worried that the opponent might switch in their Primal Groudon instead. It's worth noting that if the Ferrothorn has Protect, Leech Seed, and Power Whip, Kyogre will need to win a Protect mind game if it doesn’t want to risk having poor damage rolls and fainting. Even in this worst-case scenario, however, Ferrothorn will be heavily weakened and likely never have an opportunity to set up Spikes later in the game.</li> <li>You want to be as aggressive as possible as early as you can. This variant just requires a bit more caution with regards to where it tries to apply its pressure and when it wants to switch in. Avoiding trades with faster foes, and coming in safely on double switches is ideal.</li> <li>If you don't see targets like Ferrothorn and Blissey at Team Preview, you don't need to worry as much about conserving Water Spout strength. Origin Pulse is a very powerful attack on its own.</li> <li>This set is bothered more by Primal Groudon than physical versions. Unboosted Ice Beam is often a 3HKO, but in many situations it is better to use a double switch to punish a predictable Groudon switch-in, which helps maintain immediate pressure as opposed to chipping for better pressure later. There is also less risk to Kyogre itself, as any potential damage is taken by the teammate instead. This may be important in matchups where you want to preserve Water Spout's power.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Pokemon that can effectively pressure a healthy Primal Groudon, like Arceus-Ground, are helpful in presenting a greater risk to the Groudon for attempting to switch directly into Kyogre.</li> <li>More defensive Groudon answers like Giratina-O allow Primal Kyogre to opt for Ice Beam chip damage without forfeiting too much damage to the lost momentum. Giratina-O also has the advantage of being able to Defog away Stealth Rock to preserve Water Spout's power and can spread paralysis so Kyogre can threaten more quick OHKOs with it.</li> <li>A healthy Arceus-Water with Toxic and Recover can be difficult to overcome. Having a teammate that can deal with this situation is advised.</li> <li>The main draw to this set is that it is mostly self-sufficient, as there isn't a viable Pokemon in the metagame that can completely shut it down without playing around Water Spout perfectly. Primal Groudon forces the Kyogre user to guess, but it is also one of the easiest Pokemon to chip down. A single Ice Beam's worth of chip damage means that Groudon can no longer safely switch in unless it is faster.</li> <li>While they may not help directly with specific problems Kyogre faces, very fast Pokemon like Marshadow and Choice Scarf Xerneas are great teammates for Calm Mind + Water Spout Kyogre.</li> </ul> "

      {
        "name": "Physical Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Liquidation is the obligatory STAB move of choice because it has the greatest Base Power and a sizable chance to drop the opposing Pokemon’s Defense, granting a luckier Primal Kyogre extra opportunities to break a troublesome wall. Waterfall deserves a mention, however, for the ability to make the opposing Pokemon flinch instead, at the price of a small loss in damage output. This is valuable for teams that are able to effectively spread paralysis. The added possibility of making a lead Smeargle or Cloyster flinch is useful if you have a teammate that can reliably use Defog on the imminent Primal Groudon for the cases where you don't get lucky.</li> <li>Earthquake is the biggest draw to using a physical variant of Kyogre, since it has a chance to 2HKO offensive Primal Groudon without any prior damage or entry hazards.</li> <li>Ice Beam complements Primal Kyogre's coverage by cleanly OHKOing Salamence and Rayquaza, 2HKOing uninvested Giratina-O after Stealth Rock, OHKOing defensive Zygarde, and 2HKOing defensive Zygarde-C.</li> <li>Thunder rounds out Kyogre's coverage by hitting the handful of Water-types in the metagame. This allows Kyogre to 2HKO opposing Primal Kyogre after Stealth Rock and 2HKO Arceus-Water. The possibility to inflict paralysis is important in the Arceus-Water matchup, as it prevents the Pokemon from safely stalling with Recover if Kyogre manages to catch it with Thunder as it switches in. Thunder is also notable for breaking Lugia and defensive Yveltal, two Pokemon that would be troublesome otherwise.</li> <li>Substitute is an option to punish slower Toxic users and avoid having to guess which Pokemon attempts to switch into Kyogre’s coverage. It is also effective on the aforementioned paralysis teams and can be used to beat Arceus-Water that lack Judgment.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>252 Attack EVs are used to make sure Primal Kyogre hits as hard as possible.</li> <li>Speed is maximized due to Kyogre's dependence on moving first in a crowded Speed tier.</li> <li>An Adamant nature allows Kyogre to 2HKO most offensive variants of Primal Groudon with Earthquake. With Stealth Rock or prior damage, 2HKOing defensive variants becomes possible as well.</li> <li>Jolly is also viable, as oftentimes exchanges between Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre come down to which of the two is faster. However, Kyogre begins to start missing 2HKOs on Groudon with marginal defensive investment without Stealth Rock in play.</li> <li>Giving Kyogre a bit of bulk is viable to allow it to trade with Pokemon that it can never hope to outrun. 32 HP 64 Defense EVs, for example, allow Kyogre to survive Jolly Mega Salamence's Double-Edge after Stealth Rock while still affording Kyogre enough Speed to outrun unboosted Blaziken.</li> <li>It may seem strange to see a Special Attack-reducing nature being recommended for a set with multiple special coverage moves, but it does not prevent Kyogre from hitting the crucial KO benchmarks that it needs with these moves. Therefore, not reducing Kyogre's Speed or bulk is far more appreciated.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>It's often tempting to play conservatively with Primal Kyogre, as it is commonly the most effective breaker in a given matchup. However, Kyogre shines the most when it gets to exert early-game pressure to force difficult decisions from the opponent, most notably with regards to what they should do with their Primal Groudon.</li> <li>It's important to keep in mind that, even if a Primal Groudon manages to switch in safely, it is often a team's Stealth Rock setter. Knowing this, going for the potential 2HKO with Earthquake can punish an opponent looking to set up Stealth Rock early, where it matters most, on an expected switch. The advantage with this line of play is that, even if the opponent expects it, they are forced to choose between setting up Stealth Rock and trading with the immediate Kyogre threat. Freely eliminating Primal Groudon or indirectly pressuring Stealth Rock from being set on your side of the field is helpful for teams with other Pokemon that struggle versus a healthy Groudon or dislike having enemy Stealth Rock in play.</li> <li>In general, it is important to know when you should trade in Kyogre for getting off great damage on a threatening foe and, oftentimes, forced lines of play from the opponent.</li> <li>For example, when facing a Sticky Web team, use Kyogre as an anti-lead against Smeargle to force the opponent to switch to Primal Groudon after Smeargle is KOed. Leave Kyogre in against opposing Primal Groudon as fodder to get off as much chip damage as possible to weaken its Eruption as much as possible. After Kyogre is KOed, switch into a Defogger like Mega Salamence or Giratina-O to get rid of the Sticky Web on your side of the field.</li> <li>Pay careful attention to Team Preview. If their Arceus forme is Water type, the way you will have to play with Kyogre can change. Oftentimes, Arceus-Water is used early as the switch-in to Kyogre, since it is much harder to chip away at than Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Just because Kyogre’s coverage is impressive doesn’t mean you should always attack with it when you get the chance. Double switching is very useful for capitalizing on Kyogre’s immediate pressure.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Pokemon that benefit from having Primal Groudon weakened are great options. Necrozma-DM and Xerneas are two such Pokemon. Necrozma-DM can threaten a sweep much more easily once Primal Groudon is within Earthquake's KO range. Geomancy Xerneas often comes just barely short of an OHKO versus most Primal Groudon variants, so any amount of chip damage helps. Choice Scarf Xerneas variants become harder to switch into as well for offensive teams with a weakened Primal Groudon. Primal Kyogre can also check any lingering Necrozma-DM for Xerneas.</li> <li>Lunala and Ho-Oh both appreciate Kyogre's ability to pressure the metagame's premier Stealth Rock setter, Primal Groudon. Ho-Oh deserves special mention for its ability to pressure and punish Ferrothorn for Kyogre. Ho-Oh can even run Defog to make sure Ferrothorn's Spikes are never an issue.</li> <li>Mega Salamence and Giratina-O can both switch into Primal Groudon as well as Defog away any Stealth Rock on your side of the field.</li> <li>Having Yveltal on your team forces opposing Primal Groudon to guess between two Pokemon immune to its powerful STAB attacks. Life Orb or Choice Specs variants of Yveltal are ideal for this, as they are much more immediately threatening to a healthy Primal Groudon. Life Orb Yveltal also has access to Sucker Punch, which shines in matchups where Kyogre isn't at its strongest.</li> <li>Pokemon that want pressure on Arceus-Water, like Mega Salamence, Dragon Dance Zygarde-C, Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, Arceus-Ground, and Primal Groudon, pair well with Kyogre. Thunder paralysis is all it takes to open the gates for these offensive Pokemon to get past a popular wall.</li> <li>Pokemon that can handle an active Arceus-Water, like Mega Gengar and Ferrothorn, will give Kyogre more leeway when it comes to guessing which coverage moves to use.</li> <li>Barring a few exceptions, most Pokemon faster than Kyogre tend to not have very much bulk and will rely more on their ability to attack first. This makes Pokemon that are at the top of Ubers Speed curve, like Mega Gengar, Marshadow, and many Choice Scarf users, are valuable teammates, as they exert greater pressure in the matchups that Kyogre is weakest in. In return, Kyogre's great pressure versus Pokemon slower than itself helps to set up late-game sweeps for these teammates.</li> </ul> "

      {
        "name": "Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Scald is the STAB move of choice for defensive variants of Primal Kyogre. A Scald burn is the most Kyogre can threaten Ferrothorn with. The status spread in general is great for annoying foes, and the Attack stat drop associated with it complements Kyogre’s large Special Defense.</li> <li>Rest with Sleep Talk is the only form of recovery that Kyogre has access to. The inflexibility may be a limiting factor, but the ability to sponge status can be a crucial perk. Most notably, Kyogre can switch safely into assorted support Arceus formes and play a long game with them as opposed to being put on a timer by Toxic.</li> <li>The last slot is dedicated to chipping away at Primal Groudon. Ice Beam is the generally safest choice, as it also prevents Facade Mega Salamence from switching in freely. Toxic, however, is more threatening in general and makes it much harder to outlast this set. It's also the best option for dealing with support Arceus-Water without PP stalling.</li> <li>Calm Mind can occasionally work on teams dedicated to its success. It makes this variant of Kyogre a pretty effective stallbreaker. In most matchups, however, Kyogre will prefer having another move. Some teams may opt for the move regardless so Kyogre can serve as a check to Calm Mind Arceus formes that aren't defeated by Toxic.</li> <li>Origin Pulse can be considered for the STAB attack. Even without investment, Kyogre’s damage with it is impressive. It remains generally inferior to Scald, though, as it lacks the ability to threaten burns and doesn't reach any notable KO benchmarks in exchange.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>The given EV spread allows Primal Kyogre to survive two uninvested Precipice Blades from Primal Groudon, a +2 Searing Sunraze Smash from Necrozma-DM, a +1 Double-Edge from Adamant Mega Salamence, two boosted Hexes from Mega Gengar, two Moonblasts from unboosted Xerneas after Stealth Rock, and two Life Orb-boosted Dark Pulses from Yveltal after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Running maximum Speed with a Timid nature is a viable alternative, as defensive Kyogre doesn't have the recovery or bulk to hard wall most offensive Pokemon. Being faster notably allows it check any slower Swords Dance Groudon, only risking a Speed tie in the worst-case scenario.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Contrary to every other Primal Kyogre set, this one is best played conservatively.</li> <li>You aren't looking to apply immediate pressure on key Pokemon as much as just be an annoying status sponge that is difficult to force out. The sort of teams that can threaten this Kyogre with hard hits generally don't have long-term solutions to the status effects it threatens. Meanwhile, the teams that can afford to play a long game with it will typically struggle with its powerful Scalds and ability to absorb blows.</li> <li>Support Arceus formes, and anything else that mostly relies on status to deal damage, are the prime targets to switch into.</li> <li>Against teams that lack these sort of Pokemon, Kyogre is best used for threatening trades. It can also help check some weaker special attackers, like Gengar on the turn it is Mega Evolving, or be used as a roadblock to certain setup sweepers, like mixed Rock Polish Groudon.</li> <li>Even though Kyogre's bulk is impressive, the lack of consistent recovery undermines what it can switch into. If a foe 3HKOes it, this means it can only safely switch in once, and if it is 4HKOed, its ability to check the threat is entirely luck dependent while it is sleeping from Rest.</li> <li>Kyogre is at its most vulnerable and most exploitable when it is sleeping from Rest. It's ideal to use the move as late as possible.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>This set is extremely punishable by Primal Groudon, especially if Primal Kyogre isn't using Toxic. Zygarde, defensive Lunala, and Giratina-O are all good examples of reliable Groudon switch-ins. Keep in mind that Primal Groudon has multiple viable sets and that it's best to not rely on a single Pokemon to account for it.</li> <li>Facade Mega Salamence is another powerful Pokemon able to punish defensive Kyogre if you opt for Toxic instead of Ice Beam. Steel-types, like Skarmory and Necrozma-DM, are ideal checks due to their sizable bulk, Flying-type resistance, and reliable recovery.</li> <li>Ferrothorn is especially troublesome, as it can very easily threaten multiple layers of Spikes. Mega Sableye and Defog Ho-Oh are the best answers to it, as they can consistently deal with any Spikes Ferrothorn attempt to set up.</li> <li>Cleric support is appreciated but not strictly required. It helps mitigate the downsides of Rest as Kyogre's only means of recovery. Blissey, Xerneas, and Magearna are the most common options for this role. Keep in mind, however, that you will rarely be given convenient opportunities to heal your sleeping Kyogre. Thus, you shouldn't rely on the possibility of Heal Bell support and use Rest aggressively without very careful thought.</li> <li>Kyogre's lack of Leftovers means that any sort of entry hazard makes things difficult for it to switch in frequently and makes it very vulnerable to double switches. Reliable Defog support from the likes of defensive Lunala and Giratina-O can help a lot. These two Pokemon are especially notable for their ability to handle the most common Stealth Rock setter, Primal Groudon.</li> </ul> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Origin Pulse is the consistent and strong STAB attack that this sort of set wants. The heavy Special Attack investment means that it outdamages physical Primal Kyogre's Liquidation in terms of raw power. Most notably, it deals over 70% to neutral Arceus formes with full HP investment, which allows it to 2HKO a support Arceus forme that uses Toxic followed by Recover with Stealth Rock in play.</li> <li>Ice Beam is the most important of the available coverage options, as it deals with Primal Groudon and other Pokemon that resist Water like Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Thunder deals with Arceus-Water and lets Primal Kyogre easily win the one-on-one matchup thanks to the heavy Special Attack investment. Substitute is another option for easing predictions while still retaining the ability to beat Arceus-Water as it switches in when used with Calm Mind. However, Kyogre loses the ability to cleanly beat Arceus-Water one-on-one, which is a unique advantage to this variant.</li> <li>Liquidation is for defeating Confide Blissey and Chansey.

This set has the same simplicity of the physical variant but comes with a few situational perks and disadvantages.</li> <li>One unique advantage worth mentioning is that this Primal Kyogre set doesn't have to predict around Arceus-Water, unless Toxic is a significant concern, as it can easily react to it with Thunder.</li> <li>Calm Mind is best used versus slower teams, which will then often be forced to trade at least one Pokemon for the ability to chip Kyogre with status. It can also be used on a predicated sacrifice so Kyogre can trade more favorably with the next Pokemon.</li> <li>If using Liquidation, Kyogre can function as a lure for Blissey and Chansey.

In a pinch, you can even switch to Kyogre to force Arceus-Water to switch out itself.</li> <li>Pokemon that struggle versus Blissey and Chansey, like Choice Specs Yveltal and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, become stronger considerations for your team when using Liquidation on Kyogre as a lure.</li> </ul> "

The Speed lowering ability of Rock Tomb or the damage of Stone Edge is typically preferred across Primal Groudon's sets, however.</li> <li>Earthquake can be used in place of Precipice Blades if accuracy is a concern, but the damage difference can prove annoying.</li> <li>Swords Dance + 3 physical attack sets can be viable on Sticky Web teams, but such a team style is not as effective, and other sets are capable of fitting these teams just as easily.</li> <li>Dragon Claw targets many airborne Dragon-types in Ubers that may want to switch into Primal Groudon, but is hard to fit onto any movesets.</li> <li>Earth Power can be used on the mixed Rock Polish set in place of Precipice Blades to hit opposing Primal Groudon harder and also OHKO Toxapex after Stealth Rock damage, but it does less damage than Precipice Blades against most Pokemon in Ubers, even though this set lacks Attack investment.</li> <li>A Substitute + Swords Dance set can be used in order to pose a greater threat to stall teams thanks to its ability to avoid Toxic, but this set suffers many of the same issues as the Swords Dance + 3 attacks set.</li> <li>Rest can be used on defensive sets to avoid dealing with Toxic and provide some form of longevity for Primal Groudon. However, it is difficult to fit.</li> <li>Solar Beam finds a small niche on the mixed Rock Polish set, as it is able to beat Arceus-Water, a Pokemon that such a set cannot reasonably beat otherwise. It is useless outside of this, however.</li> <li>Base forme Groudon has a couple of options such as a physically defensive set, a Choice Band set, or a Swords Dance set utilizing a Z-Move. However, the opportunity cost of skipping Primal Groudon for this is extremely high, so it should never see serious use.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Arceus-Water and Arceus-Dragon</strong>: These two Arceus formes are resistant to Fire and neutral to Ground, have access to reliable recovery and Defog, and are also faster than Primal Groudon, making them effective countermeasures against most of its sets. Arceus-Water has trouble actually damaging Primal Groudon with attacks, however, and typically tries to Toxic stall it instead. Primal Groudon is capable of breaking these Pokemon with a Swords Dance set or crippling them back with its own Toxic, but otherwise they make for effective checks, meaning Primal Groudon is likely to require the assistance of its teammates to beat them.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde-C: Zygarde-C is capable of switching into a good number of Primal Groudon's sets thanks to its high bulk and resistance to Fire, while hitting back with Thousand Arrows or paralyzing Primal Groudon with Glare. It should be noted that Zygarde's effectiveness against Primal Groudon can vary a lot on how well one plays around Power Construct. Zygarde-C is also vulnerable to Hidden Power Ice from specially oriented Primal Groudon sets, and base forme Zygarde can be OHKOed by a +2 Precipice Blades from the Double Dance set if it is slightly damaged.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Ground: Arceus-Ground is one of the best offensive checks to Primal Groudon, as its Ground-type STAB attacks are capable of hitting Primal Groudon very hard, OHKOing it in some instances. However, Arceus-Ground will take severe damage if it switches into Fire Blast or Overheat and be OHKOed by a full-power Eruption.</p> <p><strong>Lugia</strong>: With its high bulk, good Speed, and Multiscale ability, Lugia is capable of switching into Primal Groudon easily and healing any damage taken with Roost. However, Lugia can be vulnerable to some of Primal Groudon's attacks if Multiscale is broken, and it does not appreciate Toxic poison because this makes keeping Multiscale up very difficult.</p> <p><strong>Giratina and Giratina-O</strong>: Both Giratina formes can take on Primal Groudon relatively well. Giratina's higher bulk and typical use of Rest means that it stands a better chance of handling Primal Groudon throughout the match, but it can be beaten by Swords Dance sets. Giratina-O handles Primal Groudon in a more offensive manner, hitting it hard with Draco Meteor or other offensive moves while trying to remove Stealth Rock with Defog if Primal Groudon has set it. Giratina-O is vulnerable to being worn down and can be hit hard by boosted attacks or Dragon Pulse, however.</p> <p><strong>Mega Salamence</strong>: Mega Salamence is a great offensive check to some Primal Groudon sets, as the usage of Intimidate prior to Mega Evolution makes switching in easier. Mega Salamence also has an immunity or a resistance to both of Primal Groudon's STAB attacks, on top of having access to reliable recovery and Defog to assist it in dealing with Primal Groudon's sets. Primal Groudon can still retaliate with a boosted Stone Edge or with Hidden Power Ice from a specially oriented set or force Mega Salamence to Roost with Overheat, which can make the matchup dangerous.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh can easily handle Primal Groudon's STAB attacks and hit back hard with Brave Bird, provided it is an offensive set. Defensive sets can Toxic stall Primal Groudon or Defog its Stealth Rock away as well. It should be noted that a 4x weakness to Rock means that Ho-Oh has to be very wary of Primal Groudon's coverage when attempting to take it on.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: While Primal Kyogre takes the risk of being hit hard by Precipice Blades, it is capable of switching into Primal Groudon when it is predicted that it will use a move that isn't as threatening, forcing Primal Groudon out immediately. Primal Kyogre can take advantage of Primal Groudon's usage of Fire-type moves thanks to Primordial Sea. Even when Primal Groudon has the weather advantage, Earthquake from physical variants of Primal Kyogre will still hurt. An Attack-invested Precipice Blades will severely damage Primal Kyogre, though, sometimes even OHKOing it after Stealth Rock damage, so it has to be very careful.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Steel-types</strong>: Celesteela and Skarmory are capable of handing Primal Groudon sets that do not often carry Fire-type coverage, such as the Double Dance set, courtesy of their typing and different recovery options. A large number of Primal Groudon sets do carry Fire-type coverage, however, making them very risky switch-ins.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Ground-immune Pokemon: Pokemon such as Yveltal, Rayquaza, and Arceus-Flying are capable of switching into Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades or otherwise non-lethal moves and threatening it with heavy damage if it stays in. Predicting wrong and then taking a Fire-type move from Primal Groudon will severely damage these Pokemon, though.</p> <p><strong>Lunala: Courtesy of Shadow Shield, Lunala is more capable than other offensive Pokemon at offensively checking Primal Groudon. With Shadow Shield intact, it can survive any attack, even a +2 Precipice Blades, and inflict heavy damage back with Moongeist Beam or Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom.</p> <p><strong>Toxic</strong>: Due to a complete lack of recovery, inflicting Primal Groudon with Toxic poison will greatly limit its longevity in a match.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Stealth Rock is a valuable entry hazard for spreading damage across the enemy team and limiting the effectiveness of Flying-types such as Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Rayquaza.</li> <li>Swords Dance, when combined with Stealth Rock, allows this Primal Groudon variant to be both a utility entry hazard setter and a wallbreaker at the same time against Defog users such as support Arceus formes, Giratina, and Ho-Oh that would try to remove Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Precipice Blades is capable of 2HKOing typical support Arceus formes such as Arceus-Water, OHKOing them at +2.</li> <li>Rock Tomb targets switch-ins like Ho-Oh, Lugia, and Mega Salamence, while also slowing all Arceus formes down to the point where Primal Groudon can strike them first. This, along with the threat of a boosted Precipice Blades, heavily limits their ability to use Defog on Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Stone Edge is a stronger Rock-type move that proves beneficial against Giratina-O and Mega Salamence and has the power to OHKO defensive Ho-Oh at the cost of lacking a method to slow Arceus formes and other faster Pokemon.</li> <li>Smack Down is a niche option that gives Primal Groudon the ability to remove the Ground-type immunity of common switch-ins, opening up the possibility of using the stronger Precipice Blades against them. This proves especially useful against Skarmory and Celesteela, as Rock-type coverage moves tend to lack the power to beat them, whereas Precipice Blades will heavily damage them.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>The given EV spread allows Primal Groudon to survive +2 Focus Blast from Geomancy Xerneas after taking Stealth Rock damage as base forme Groudon, survive +1 Double-Edge from Adamant Mega Salamence, and outspeed Adamant Necrozma-DM, with the rest of the EVs put into Attack with an Adamant nature to boost damage output.</li> <li>An EV spread of 172 Atk / 144 SpD / 192 Spe with a Jolly nature allows Primal Groudon to outspeed Dragon Dance variants of Zygarde-C prior to boosts, enabling a potential +2 hit on it before it sets up Substitute or Dragon Dance boosts. It will also survive +2 Focus Blast from Geomancy Xerneas after Stealth Rock damage. Maximum Speed investment instead of Special Defense is also valid to Speed tie with opposing Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>Red Orb is required for Primal Reversion.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>This set preys on Pokemon that assume Primal Groudon will struggle to punish their attempts at entry hazard removal.</li> <li>Setting Stealth Rock on forced switches is ideal. It works out better if the opponent switches to a Defog user such as a support Arceus forme, Ho-Oh, or Giratina, as Primal Groudon can then reveal Swords Dance or Rock Tomb and surprise the opponent, likely putting them into an unfavorable situation where they have to decide between dealing with Primal Groudon and the Stealth Rock it can set.</li> <li>Giratina-O is a bit harder to handle without Stone Edge or Smack Down, as even a boosted Rock Tomb can struggle to make Primal Groudon win should it come to a duel. Managing Primal Groudon's HP and getting chip damage onto Giratina-O will be key to setting up Stealth Rock against it.</li> <li>Using Rock Tomb on predicted switches can make dueling enemy Pokemon easier or make it easier for a teammate to switch in and handle the foe due to the Speed drop.</li> <li>Rarer variants of Arceus-Ground that carry Defog will give this set a very hard time if Primal Groudon has taken any damage, as Arceus-Ground is faster and has the ability to decide between using Defog and KOing Primal Groudon with Judgment before it can retaliate with boosted attacks, something other support Arceus formes cannot do. This means that Primal Groudon may have to use Swords Dance as Arceus-Ground switches in to give it the necessary pressure to set Stealth Rock while threatening to OHKO with a boosted Precipice Blades, but it will likely emerge severely damaged or unable to set Stealth Rock in the process. In general, be wary of this matchup.</li> <li>The best method for the opponent to deal with this set is to simply overpower Primal Groudon, as very few Defog users can safely remove the Stealth Rock this Primal Groudon variant sets due to brute force getting the better of them. Primal Groudon still has other utility in checking threats such as Primal Kyogre and Xerneas, so be wary of taking too much damage unless teammates can safely handle threats in exchange for Primal Groudon setting Stealth Rock.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Stealth Rock + Swords Dance Primal Groudon excels at forcing bulky teams into difficult situations. The downside of this is that Primal Groudon likely has to duel enemy Defog users to keep Stealth Rock up and may come out too damaged to check threats. This means that extra checks to various threats that Primal Groudon would help against are ideal.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM is one of the ideal partners to this set. It offers a secondary check to Xerneas and appreciates Primal Groudon's ability to break past many answers such as Arceus-Water and Ho-Oh, with Primal Groudon even being able to set Stealth Rock to limit Ho-Oh's ability to check Necrozma-DM. Ultra Necrozma sets are also very potent, doubling down on the wallbreaking ability.</li> <li>Offensive Primal Kyogre checks such as Rayquaza, Palkia, and Giratina-O come in handy for situations where Primal Kyogre switches into Primal Groudon for free. Having sufficient offensive strength across the team is key to prevent Primal Kyogre from dealing too much damage to teams that otherwise lack secondary checks.</li> <li>Xerneas also benefits from the pressure this Primal Groudon set can bring to the table against its Steel-type checks. With a Choice Scarf set, Xerneas can threaten many offensive Pokemon, most notably Yveltal, and provide cleric support, both of which are important traits, as this Primal Groudon variant best deals with bulkier teams and not offensive ones. Geomancy sets can also provide offensive pressure and enjoy Ho-Oh being weakened.</li> <li>Many Ghost-types such as Lunala and Marshadow are capable of working alongside this Primal Groudon set. Both of them enjoy Stealth Rock support and additional pressure against various Arceus formes. Lunala provides a check to various threats as long as Shadow Shield is intact and threatens support Arceus-Ground. Marshadow offers revenge killing potential against many offensive threats.</li> <li>Offensive Arceus formes such as Extreme Killer Arceus, Arceus-Ground, and Arceus-Flying all offer various benefits to offensive teams and fit well with this set. Extreme Killer Arceus offers strong priority against offensive teams, Arceus-Ground offers sweeping potential with Calm Mind or Swords Dance, and Arceus-Flying helps against opposing Ground-types and Marshadow.</li> </ul> "

It can also open up a free turn by forcing recovery options from common switch-ins such as Arceus-Ground and Mega Salamence, as well as OHKO Marshadow, something that Precipice Blades cannot do without Attack investment.</li> <li>Toxic cripples many Defog users, making it difficult for them to remove Primal Groudon's Stealth Rock in the long run. It also punishes most Pokemon that would hope to take both of Primal Groudon's STAB attacks, such as Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Lava Plume could be used over Overheat, trading burst damage for consistency along with a good burn rate, further improving Primal Groudon's ability to spread status among the enemy team. This can lead to Primal Groudon pressuring the opponent less due to the lower damage output, however, and it is much more beneficial to afflict some Pokemon such as Arceus-Water with Toxic poison than with a burn.</li> <li>Thunder Wave can be used over Toxic to remove the Speed advantage that Mega Salamence and support Arceus formes have over Primal Groudon, improving the odds of fellow team members and Primal Groudon itself breaking through them. The residual damage of Toxic generally proves more useful, however.</li> <li>Roar can be used over a status option to phaze boosting attackers such as Geomancy Xerneas and Dragon Dance variants of Zygarde-C and Mega Salamence.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum HP investment increases Primal Groudon's overall bulk, allowing it to tank notable hits in combination with further defensive investment.</li> <li>56 Defense EVs and a Relaxed nature buff Primal Groudon's already impressive Defense stat to the point that it can handle common physical threats. Specifically, this spread can survive a +2 Earthquake from Necrozma-DM, take a +2 Close Combat from Mega Lucario, avoid the 2HKO from Marshadow, and also avoid the OHKO from Dugtrio's Tectonic Rage. Defense investment assists against physical variants of Primal Kyogre as well.</li> <li>The remaining EVs are used in Special Defense to handle typical special attackers such as Primal Kyogre and Xerneas. Primal Groudon can avoid the 2HKO from Primal Kyogre's Ice Beam and avoid the OHKO from boosted Geomancy Xerneas. It also avoids the 2HKO from Choice Scarf Yveltal's Dark Pulse should it ever prove necessary.</li> <li>Red Orb is required for Primal Reversion.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>The main goal of this set is to support the team by acting as a blanket check to common Pokemon in Ubers, setting Stealth Rock, and forcing predictable plays from the opponent with the usage of Overheat.</li> <li>Aim to set Stealth Rock on forced switches or otherwise free turns, but have a plan on how you will play around the opponent's methods of entry hazard removal. This can range from using Toxic as the enemy Pokemon uses Defog to attacking instead of setting Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Be careful around opposing Primal Kyogre, as they are capable of switching directly into Primal Groudon's Overheat or Stealth Rock and forcing it out immediately. This can cause significant problems if Primal Groudon is the only answer to Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>Primal Groudon's HP is a very important resource, as it is generally the first answer to many different Pokemon in Ubers. Avoid taking unnecessary damage from Pokemon aiming to chip Primal Groudon's HP into range of another foe such as Geomancy Xerneas.</li> <li>This also means avoiding Toxic unless the situation calls for it. Having a cleric on the team makes trading Toxic with enemy Defog users such as Arceus-Water an easier decision.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Support Primal Groudon is capable of fitting with just about every Pokemon in the tier, as its utility and power offer a large amount of usefulness to a team. It tends to find a place on balanced or bulky offense teams.</li> <li>A secondary Water-type resistance is helpful alongside this set, as it can struggle to contain Primal Kyogre by itself. Arceus-Water and Ferrothorn can be common partners to Primal Groudon on balance teams for this reason.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM and Primal Groudon work rather well in tandem with each other, helping to cover Xerneas between them. With Stealth Rock on Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM can use a variety of offensive sets or even use Stealth Rock as well to gain more chances of keeping the entry hazard up against some teams.</li> <li>Ground-type checks are also wanted alongside Primal Groudon, as it can prove to be an annoying weakness to deal with. Celesteela, Giratina-O, and Zygarde-C can all be good for this purpose, with some combination between the three being plausible.</li> <li>Defog users are helpful to prevent entry hazard damage wearing at Primal Groudon's precious HP. Support Arceus formes, Giratina-O, and Mega Salamence are all good ideas, but more offensive Defoggers such as Choice Scarf Xerneas and Yveltal can also prove useful depending on overall team structure.</li> <li>Although it can be difficult to find and more difficult to fit, a cleric will make Primal Groudon's life much easier when dealing with common Toxic users such as Arceus-Water. Some Xerneas variants are capable of providing this support, as is Heal Bell Magearna.</li> </ul> "

Against neutral targets, it outdamages a maximum Attack Precipice Blades by a decent margin.</li> <li>Hidden Power Ice hits most targets that Primal Groudon's STAB combination misses out on, and it notably allows Primal Groudon to beat Pokemon such as Zygarde-C and Mega Salamence with greater ease than other sets.</li> <li>Dragon Pulse is an alternative option to Hidden Power Ice that trades a 4x super effective hit on Zygarde-C and Mega Salamence in exchange for a 2HKO on Giratina-O.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum Special Attack investment with a Mild nature offers the most power to Fire Blast and Primal Groudon's coverage.

The sheer power behind a neutral Fire Blast can also limit Pokemon such as Yveltal from switching in safely.</li> <li>This set can struggle against balance teams, however, as checks such as Giratina-O, Primal Kyogre, Ho-Oh, and most importantly Arceus-Water are all commonly seen on them. It is wise to get them out of the way or considerably weaken them before attempting to sweep.</li> <li>Set up Rock Polish against offensive teams whenever a suitable chance is given, but avoid taking too much damage while doing so.</li> <li>As this set doesn't boost its own attacking stats, weakening the enemy team into the range for Primal Groudon to clean up is ideal. Stealth Rock support helps immensely with this.</li> <li>Note that due to running no physical bulk and a Mild nature, Primal Groudon will take more damage from physical attacks than usual. This also applies to priority attacks, making this set a little easier to revenge kill.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>As this set is good at dealing with typical offensive checks to Primal Groudon, wallbreakers make for good partners to assist in dealing with bulky Pokemon that this set struggles with.</li> <li>Stealth Rock support is very helpful against Ho-Oh, which otherwise walls this set pretty easily. This best comes from dedicated leads such as Deoxys-S and Excadrill, as Stealth Rock Arceus-Fairy and Necrozma-DM struggle against Ho-Oh without Stone Edge, which can be difficult to fit onto their movesets.</li> <li>Wallbreakers such as Rayquaza, Yveltal, and Mega Lucario are all capable partners that can assist in punching holes into the enemy team in order to make Primal Groudon's sweep easier.</li> <li>Ways of pressuring support Arceus formes such as Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Water will be required to prevent them from easily walling this set. Trapping them with Shadow Tag users such as Gothitelle and Mega Gengar is a possible idea, as is simply overpowering them with other Pokemon such as Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>If using this set on a more balanced team, Zygarde-C makes for a great Ho-Oh answer, a very desirable trait in a partner.</li> </ul> "

To showcase Overheat's power, Swords Dance Arceus-Ground variants can be OHKOed after Stealth Rock damage.</li> <li>152 Speed EVs allow Primal Groudon to outspeed Adamant Necrozma-DM while also outspeeding Pokemon up to maximum Speed Arceus formes and Mega Salamence after their Speed has been lowered by Rock Tomb.</li> <li>The rest of the EVs are allocated to Special Defense, letting Primal Groudon survive two Ice Beams from Primal Kyogre after taking Stealth Rock damage as base forme Groudon, as well as any boosted move from Geomancy Xerneas at full health.</li> <li>Red Orb is required for Primal Reversion.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>As this set is relatively proactive against common Defog users, setting up Stealth Rock early can be a good idea.</li> <li>Depending on what fourth move Primal Groudon is running, the matchup against specific Defog users can change.</li> <li>Toxic is capable of messing with any Defog user that switches into Primal Groudon when combined with the threat of its STAB options.</li> <li>The usage of Stealth Rock may lure Zygarde into a false sense of security, which can be taken advantage of with Hidden Power Ice should it switch in.</li> <li>Hidden Power Ice is also very effective against Mega Salamence, a potential Defog user that handles most of Primal Groudon's attacks.</li> <li>Rock Tomb is effective against faster switch-ins and may scare them out with the fear of Overheat next turn, but it most notably gives this set the ability to hit Ho-Oh, which can be another potential Defog user to watch out for.</li> <li>Using Rock Tomb or Hidden Power Ice can make this set pretty helpless against Arceus-Water, so be ready to handle it with other methods.</li> <li>Be careful with Overheat usage, as it may end up giving away a free turn to Primal Kyogre or a setup sweeper if Primal Groudon is at -2.</li> <li>Dragon Tail forces most Defog users to decide between healing themselves, removing Stealth Rock, or damaging Primal Groudon in some way before being phazed out. It's best used after Stealth Rock has already been set.</li> <li>After Primal Groudon phazes an incoming check with Dragon Tail, it may be unable to come in again without being KOed by Overheat. This applies to Arceus-Ground and Mega Salamence specifically.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>This set better fits teams that want Stealth Rock support to come from Primal Groudon, but without the lower damage output of a defensive support set. Some form of an overall offensive team will be desired, as this set cannot stand up to strong attackers for very long.</li> <li>Due to this set's offensive EV investment, it cannot handle Xerneas very reliably. Support from Magearna or Necrozma-DM is highly valued to assist against it.</li> <li>Mega Salamence, whether it be a Defog or Dragon Dance variant, stands out as a partner that can support this Primal Groudon's playstyle of a good offense being a good defense. It can take on opposing Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh while also functioning somewhat as a revenge killer.</li> <li>Giratina-O follows a similar train of thought by offensively checking opposing Primal Groudon while spreading status to boost the damage of its own Hex against the likes of support Arceus formes.</li> <li>Dragon Dance Zygarde and Swords Dance Arceus-Ground are able to take advantage of this set's ability to mess with Giratina-O and Mega Salamence.</li> <li>This set can struggle to keep Stealth Rock up against some Defog Arceus formes such as Arceus-Water in the long run if Toxic isn't being used, and it will require some assistance to prevent them from keeping their side of the field clear of entry hazards. This can come from Shadow Tag users such as Gothitelle and Mega Gengar or from the likes of Thunder Primal Kyogre and Life Orb Yveltal, which can attempt to break through it.</li> </ul> "

This allows Primal Groudon to OHKO against the likes of Arceus-Water with a boosted Precipice Blades.</li> <li>156 Speed EVs ensure that Primal Groudon will be faster than Adamant Necrozma-DM assuming equal Speed boosts while also outspeeding a +1 Adamant maximum Speed Mega Salamence after Rock Polish.</li> <li>The rest of the EVs are allocated to Special Defense, letting Primal Groudon survive two Ice Beams from Primal Kyogre after taking Stealth Rock damage as base forme Groudon, as well as any boosted move from Geomancy Xerneas at full health.</li> <li>Taking investment away from Attack or Speed to invest 144 EVs into Special Defense allows Primal Groudon to take any boosted move from Geomancy Xerneas even after Stealth Rock damage, but this comes at the cost of lowered damage output or a compromised Speed benchmark.</li> <li>Red Orb is required for Primal Reversion.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Double Dance Primal Groudon is a wallbreaker and sweeper packed into one set. If it can get a clean setup opportunity, it will prove very hard to stop.</li> <li>This means that this set should be played a bit more cautiously. Avoid switching into strong attacks if it can be helped, because the healthier Primal Groudon is, the easier it becomes to get one boost or even both of them. It isn't uncommon for this set to be preserved until late-game.</li> <li>This set can be brought out early-game in order to be used as a wallbreaker in matchups that it may struggle to do work in, however.</li> <li>Pokemon such as Celesteela and Skarmory should be weakened or removed prior to setting up. It is a waste of Primal Groudon's HP trying to break through these checks if they are healthy. This is irrelevant if Primal Groudon is carrying Fire Punch on this set though, as it will break through them easily with it.</li> <li>Lugia can also prove troublesome if Multiscale is intact, while Ho-Oh proves annoying to Fire Punch variants. Keeping Stealth Rock up will greatly help this set's ability to break both of these Pokemon, regardless of coverage.</li> <li>Forcing a switch can give Primal Groudon the chance to get one boost, and if the opponent did not expect a Double Dance set, they may even send out a Pokemon that this set is intended to beat such as Arceus-Water, giving the opportunity to grab both boosts. This is when Primal Groudon becomes extremely threatening.</li> <li>When the time comes to set up, don't be afraid to take some damage doing so. Do not take damage twice in exchange for both boosts, however, as Primal Groudon may then be too weakened to take down many Pokemon.</li> <li>If this set gets afflicted with Toxic poison while setting up, be prepared to predict around the opponent's switches afterwards. It is likely they will try to minimize their losses to a rampaging Primal Groudon until Toxic damage takes its toll.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Stealth Rock support from Arceus-Fairy, Necrozma-DM, or a dedicated lead such as Deoxys-S or Excadrill is almost essential to increase Primal Groudon's chances of breaking through the enemy team's defenses.</li> <li>Double Dance Primal Groudon enjoys having offensive partners that can assist and follow up on any breakthroughs each one makes.</li> <li>Mega Salamence, Rayquaza, and Yveltal are all capable of damaging different Pokemon to make Primal Groudon's life easier while also helping to cover its Ground-type weakness. Mega Salamence and Rayquaza can share some checks with Primal Groudon, meaning that one can take advantage of an opening from the other.</li> <li>Trappers such as Gothitelle and Mega Gengar are able to trap and KO Pokemon such as support Arceus-Ground and Lugia to make way for Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Offensive Xerneas variants are able to pressure offensive checks to Primal Groudon such as Giratina-O, Rayquaza, Yveltal, and Zygarde-C.</li> <li>Marshadow is also capable of threatening typical checks to this set with its anti-offensive abilities and wallbreaking potential.</li> </ul> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Choice Band gives Rayquaza the most immediate power behind its physical attacks, but it locks Rayquaza into exploitable moves such as Earthquake and prevents Rayquaza from circumventing common walls such as Zygarde-C and Celesteela if it locks into its most common move, Dragon Ascent.</li> <li>Swords Dance makes Rayquaza ridiculously powerful, essentially nullifying almost every defensive check to it bar Multiscale Lugia. It is a good option for Sticky Web teams that need a wallbreaker or sweeper. However, this removes most of Rayquaza's capabilities against offense due to its low Speed tier and leaves the set extremely vulnerable to Marshadow.</li> <li>Defog can be a useful option on Rayquaza because it scares off most hazard setters thanks to its great coverage, but Defog costs a key moveslot for something that could have more utility such as Extreme Speed, and Rayquaza has no longevity or Speed to use Defog safely and repeatedly.</li> <li>Tailwind is a rather niche option and only lasts for three turns, but it can function similarly to Dragon Dance and makes Rayquaza outspeed all but a boosted Geomancy Xerneas, meaning that Rayquaza can pick off foes while offering its team a massive Speed boost, since it commonly switches out after attacking.</li> <li>Charti Berry can help Rayquaza against common carriers of Rock-type moves such as Arceus-Rock, Tyranitar, and Primal Groudon, but most of these Pokemon carry other coverage moves that can threaten Rayquaza, and the item has less utility than Flyinium Z, Life Orb, and Focus Sash.</li> <li>Aqua Tail OHKOes Primal Groudon thanks to Air Lock, but it doesn't offer coverage that Earthquake doesn’t already provide.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Support Arceus Formes</strong>: Support Arceus formes are the most consistent and common answers to Rayquaza, as they typically run enough Speed investment to outspeed all unboosted variants of Rayquaza. Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Water are good examples of these formes, usually taking +1 Dragon Ascent comfortably while KOing back with Ice Beam. However, all of these formes bar Arceus-Rock are threatened by a boosted Supersonic Skystrike, which can almost always OHKO after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy are effective offensive switch-ins to Rayquaza, as they can take advantage of mispredictions or the stray Draco Meteor and force Rayquaza out, KO it, or set up on it. Both do not like taking +1 Supersonic Skystrike, however, and Xerneas cannot switch into Dragon Ascent comfortably.</p> <p><strong>Lugia: Multiscale allows Lugia to handle mixed wallbreaker variants of Rayquaza easily, stalling it out with Substitute or Roost, and it can also take +1 Supersonic Skystrike and KO back with Ice Beam after Stealth Rock damage or after a Dragon Ascent drop. Though effective, Multiscale is extremely dependent on Stealth Rock not being up, as Rayquaza can overwhelm Lugia easily if Multiscale is not active, especially the Dragon Dance variant.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde-C</strong>: Zygarde-C is best suited to checking Dragon Dance variants of Rayquaza, as Life Orb Draco Meteor can OHKO Zygarde-C after Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes. Power Construct is the main tool for Zygarde to check Rayquaza, but it can leave Zygarde-C rather weakened after activation, so Rayquaza can pressure Zygarde-C into +1 Supersonic Skystrike range or not even get it to transform at all, leaving Zygarde unable to check Rayquaza.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Rock-types such as Tyranitar, Mega Diancie, and Arceus-Rock are able to threaten or OHKO Rayquaza and take Dragon Ascent or V-create but lose if Rayquaza is carrying Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Steel-types: While they don't appreciate taking +1 Supersonic Skystrike and lose to V-create, Celesteela, Bronzong, and Skarmory can take on Rayquaza if it is carrying Earthquake and can either stall it out or take the opportunity to set up Leech Seed, Stealth Rock, or Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Rayquaza's base 95 Speed leaves it vulnerable to revenge killers, even if it does have Extreme Speed. Marshadow, Mega Mewtwo Y, Deoxys-A under Psychic Terrain, Swords Dance Arceus, Mega Lucario, and Mega Salamence can outspeed and usually KO Rayquaza due to its low bulk and residual damage from Stealth Rock and Life Orb.</p> <p><strong>Status: Rayquaza is left largely useless by burns and paralysis crippling its offensive capabilities or whatever Speed advantage it has. Rayquaza doesn't particularly like being hit with Toxic either, as poison combined with drops from Dragon Ascent or V-create and Life Orb recoil can leave it extremely vulnerable to being revenge killed.</p> ",

The move will easily dispose of Mega Salamence and an untransformed Zygarde, and combined with Dragon Ascent and Stealth Rock damage, it can swiftly remove Giratina as well.</li> <li>V-create can surprise Celesteela after it has been lured in and muscle through Necrozma-DM, but the Speed drop is very detrimental and can force Rayquaza out, stopping a sweep early.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum Attack and Speed investment along with an Adamant nature best utilizes Rayquaza's offensive capabilities and decent Speed tier.</li> <li>A Jolly nature allows Rayquaza to outspeed neutral-natured Xerneas and Yveltal, Speed tie with Tapu Lele, and outspeed Naive Deoxys-A after a Dragon Dance, but keep in mind that Rayquaza's initial power is noticeably reduced.</li> <li>Flyinium Z converts Dragon Ascent to an astonishingly powerful Supersonic Skystrike, which, when boosted, overwhelms Rayquaza's traditional checks such as support Arceus formes, Primal Groudon, and Lugia. Defensive Zygarde gets OHKOed after a small amount of residual damage if it hasn't activated Power Construct, and Steel-types such as Celesteela and Necrozma-DM lose at least half their HP if they try to take the hit for teammates.</li> <li>Life Orb gives Rayquaza more initial power without having to rely on Dragon Dance, but the residual damage along with Dragon Ascent's stat drops can make it progressively harder for Rayquaza to stay in or set up and prevents it from circumventing its checks with Supersonic Skystrike.</li> <li>Focus Sash gives Rayquaza more use as a revenge killer, since Dragon Ascent and Extreme Speed with an Adamant nature can usually 2HKO most offensive threats, and setting up is then easier, but the loss of power without either Flyinium Z or Life Orb forces Rayquaza to run an Adamant nature and puts more strain on its team's entry hazard removers.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>While Rayquaza is a powerful threat in Ubers, it is also frail and not speedy enough to compete with more prominent offensive threats. The best way to bring Rayquaza into the battle is during situations where it can come in safely, such as double switches, a teammate fainting, and the occasional U-turn support. This puts Rayquaza in a good position because it can force many defensive threats out, giving it a chance to dent a foe or get a Dragon Dance boost.</li> <li>Double switches in particular are prime opportunities for Rayquaza to set up a Dragon Dance, as Rayquaza is more likely to be matched up against Pokemon it can normally force out such as Ho-Oh and Mega Sableye without having to take damage or be hit with a status effect.</li> <li>If holding Life Orb, Rayquaza can mimic the mixed wallbreaker set quite effectively, so not revealing Dragon Dance until later in the game can prove quite helpful in deceiving your opponent.</li> <li>However, non-Flyinium Z variants of Rayquaza can only sweep safely if most of their checks are weakened, since +1 Dragon Ascent can't cleanly OHKO checks such as support Arceus formes, Celesteela, Mega Salamence, and regular Zygarde, and these Pokemon can cripple or KO Rayquaza in return.</li> <li>Dragon Dance can function differently for Rayquaza depending on the team it is on and the team it is facing. Usually, while this Rayquaza set can sweep, it is paired up with other sweepers such as Geomancy Xerneas, Rock Polish Primal Groudon, and Swords Dance Necrozma-DM, so Dragon Dance can be used to help Rayquaza smash through checks to these Pokemon. When fighting less bulky teams, Rayquaza can use Dragon Dance to sweep, but it is otherwise best used to smash through common defensive Pokemon.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Offensive sweepers such as Geomancy Xerneas, Mega Lucario, Mega Salamence, Rock Polish Primal Groudon, and Swords Dance Necrozma-DM appreciate Rayquaza's ability to severely damage or threaten traditional defensive threats in Ubers.</li> <li>Entry hazard setters such as Excadrill, Arceus-Fairy, Primal Groudon, and Necrozma-DM can help Rayquaza sweep or deal with its checks thanks to extra residual damage.</li> <li>Entry hazard removers such as Excadrill, Cloyster, and support Arceus formes like Arceus-Ground are paramount to keeping Stealth Rock away from Rayquaza to improve its longevity, especially if it is running Life Orb. Excadrill and Arceus-Ground are also able to ward off Tyranitar and Arceus-Rock, common switch-ins to Dragon Ascent and Supersonic Skystrike.</li> <li>Choice Scarf Xerneas can potentially clean up after Rayquaza wallbreaks or deal with slightly faster Pokemon such as Yveltal. It can also run Defog to remove Stealth Rock so Rayquaza is less likely to be revenge killed.</li> <li>Gothitelle can remove almost every support Arceus forme that threatens Rayquaza and can also trap other checks to Rayquaza such as Zygarde-C and Lugia.</li> <li>Yveltal can provide U-turn or Defog support, dents Steel-types that can take Earthquake such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Celesteela, and appreciates Rayquaza being able to handle Magearna effectively.</li> <li>Marshadow does well against Ghost-type revenge killers such as Lunala and Mega Gengar.</li> </ul> "

Many of the Pokemon that Rayquaza can switch into are defensive by nature, but be cautious of status-inflicting moves such as Sacred Fire, Toxic, and a stray Glare or Thunder Wave, since they are common on these Pokemon and can reduce either Rayquaza's effectiveness or staying power.</li> <li>This Rayquaza set plays similarly to hit-and-run Pokemon such as Deoxys-A, so play aggressively when Rayquaza is out against bulky offense or defensive teams, as it hits hard and any of the detrimental effects of Dragon Ascent, V-create, and Life Orb are less prevalent because Rayquaza won't stay in for long periods of time due to its frailty.</li> <li>Keep Rayquaza healthy against offense, since Extreme Speed can be a game changer, especially if opposing sweepers are greatly weakened.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Rayquaza appreciates Stealth Rock support, which brings many of its wallbreaking targets such as support Arceus formes and Primal Groudon into 2HKO range of Dragon Ascent. Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM are great Stealth Rock users that can wear down or cripple Rayquaza's traditional switch-ins such as Rock-types while countering Fairy-types. Excadrill can set Stealth Rock while providing entry hazard removal with Rapid Spin, but it can be a bit harder to fit into a team compared to the previous two.</li> <li>Sweepers and other offensive threats thrive when paired with Rayquaza's wallbreaking abilities. Xerneas benefits greatly from Rayquaza deterring or smashing through Steel-types and Primal Groudon, making Geomancy sets sweep easier. Choice Scarf Xerneas also synergizes well with Rayquaza, as it can remove status with Aromatherapy or remove entry hazards with Defog.</li> <li>Mega Salamence also appreciates Steel-types being weakened or removed, and this can reduce the need for Earthquake on Salamence, giving more opportunities to run utility moves such as Facade and even Defog.</li> <li>Mega Gengar can trap and remove Lugia and some support Arceus formes, allowing Rayquaza to break down the rest of the team's bulkier threats for other sweepers or Mega Gengar itself.</li> <li>Yveltal can provide U-turn or Defog support for Rayquaza and threatens common Psychic- and Ghost-type revenge killers such as Mega Mewtwo Y, Marshadow, Lunala, and Mega Gengar. Rayquaza and Yveltal together compound a weakness to Fairy-types and Stealth Rock, but many defensive teams can find it difficult to combat both without a Fairy-type such as Arceus-Fairy or Xerneas.</li> <li>Marshadow can prevent many revenge killers, and primarily Mega Gengar, from dealing with Rayquaza thanks to Shadow Sneak.</li> <li>Other miscellaneous sweepers such as Swords Dance Arceus, Mega Blaziken, Mega Lucario, and Ultra Necrozma are great offensive partners for Rayquaza, as their high Speed stats can benefit from Rayquaza pressuring common defensive Pokemon such as Giratina-O, Celesteela, and Zygarde-C.</li> </ul> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Psycho Boost is a powerful STAB Psychic-type attack that will OHKO Marshadow and Mega Gengar and do fairly good damage to neutral offensive targets.</li> <li>Taunt prevents Pokemon that may take advantage of Deoxys such as Necrozma-DM from setting up on it.</li> <li>Pursuit allows Deoxys to OHKO Mega Gengar after Stealth Rock and Deoxys-A if they try to switch out, although it should be wary of Extreme Speed from the latter.</li> <li>Spikes hurt the opponent's Pokemon when they switch in, allowing Deoxys to provide support for its team.</li> <li>Alternatively, Ice Beam can surprise bulky Dragon-types such as Zygarde-C, which may expect Deoxys to be running some other gimmick and try to take advantage of it.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>The idea behind this set is to make Marshadow users believe that they can OHKO Deoxys with priority Shadow Sneak. The given bulk along with the Kasib Berry, which reduces damage from Ghost-type attacks, allows Deoxys to always survive Shadow Sneak from Life Orb Marshadow after Stealth Rock and proceed to OHKO it. While this is an extremely useless gimmick, it stands out as something that Deoxys-A cannot achieve.</li> <li>The Speed investment allows Deoxys to barely outspeed standard Deoxys-A and OHKO it with Pursuit, giving it one additional niche, although it should be wary of Extreme Speed.</li> <li>The Attack investment allows Deoxys to always OHKO Mega Gengar with Pursuit after Stealth Rock or Spikes damage. The Special Defense investment helps in this regard by giving Deoxys-N a fairly good chance to survive an attack from Hex Mega Gengar in the event Pursuit is predicted, which is notable, as it is technically something Deoxys-A cannot do.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Don't actually use Deoxys.</li> <li>Being bulkier than the least bulky Pokemon in the game should not be mistaken for being able to take hits. Deoxys will faint from just about any attack used in the Ubers tier.</li> <li>Don't directly switch into Marshadow, as taking damage will make Deoxys unable to survive Shadow Sneak even with the Kasib Berry. Additionally, Marshadow users may realize that you are running some gimmick to handle it if you are the one to switch in. Instead, Deoxys should try to KO something weak with Psycho Boost and surprise Marshadow as it switches in to revenge kill.</li> <li>To trap its other two main targets, Mega Gengar and Deoxys-A, rely on free switches to trap and revenge kill them.</li> <li>If the opponent switches in a Pokemon that could set up on Deoxys, such as Necrozma-DM, it is usually better to stay in and use Taunt to prevent a setup, even if it risks sacrificing Deoxys.</li> <li>If running Spikes, use it when given a free turn if the opposing team does not run any of Deoxys's main targets . Otherwise, spam Psycho Boost when given a free turn.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Psycho Boost causes a stat drop that makes Deoxys easy to set up on. Because of this, Marshadow is ironically a fairly good partner, as are similar sweep-stopping Pokemon such as Scarf Xerneas and Yveltal.</li> <li>Pokemon that dislike Marshadow, such as Rayquaza, Ultra Necrozma, Mega Gengar, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Arceus-Ground, may find some benefit from Deoxys's presence.</li> <li>Similarly, Pokemon bothered by Mega Gengar, such as Arceus-Fairy, Chansey, and Toxapex, may benefit from Deoxys trapping it.</li> <li>Tapu Lele is a good partner, as it strengthens Deoxys's Psycho Boost and protects it from priority attacks that would OHKO it. However, Marshadow will not stay in on Deoxys under Psychic Terrain, so be careful not to step on your toes with that.</li> <li>Given the real reasons you run Deoxys, Pokemon such as Scarf Shaymin-S, Trick Room + Calm Mind Gothitelle, and Cloud Nine Golduck may function as more appropriate teammates.</li> </ul> "

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Deoxys-A is a powerful wallbreaker that has sky-high mixed attacking stats and a wide offensive movepool. This makes it very threatening towards some balanced and bulky offensive builds.</li> <li>However, Steel-types like Necrozma-DM, Magearna, and Mega Scizor are common picks for teams that are looking for counterplay to Geomancy Xerneas. Their bulk and typing also naturally let them check Deoxys-A.</li> <li>Deoxys-A's pitiful bulk means that it rarely finds opportunities to switch in and wallbreak, so it fits mainly on fast-paced offensive teams.</li> <li>It's easily revenge killed by Choice Scarf users like Xerneas and Yveltal and priority users like Marshadow.</li> <li>It faces competition from Ultra Necrozma and Mega Mewtwo Y as a fast Psychic-type wallbreaker. Ultra Necrozma has an easier time setting up thanks to its better bulk and ability to force mind games with its forme change; moreover, its access to Earthquake means that it has no trouble breaking past Necrozma-DM and Magearna. Mega Mewtwo Y can hit hard without lowering its Special Attack and has access to Fire Blast to melt Steel-types.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Fire Punch can be used instead of Superpower to OHKO Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn and 2HKO Magearna, but it still fails to 2HKO Necrozma-DM and leaves Deoxys-A walled by Arceus-Dark, Tyranitar, and Chansey.</li> <li>Psychic is an alternative STAB option that has the benefit of not lowering Deoxys-A's Special Attack. However, it's much weaker than Psycho Boost, missing out on important benchmarks like OHKOing Primal Groudon and 2HKOing Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Thunderbolt can be used instead of Ice Beam to hit specially bulky foes like Ho-Oh, Primal Kyogre, and Celesteela super effectively while maintaining the ability to hit Yveltal and Lugia. However, Deoxys-A will be forced to use Psycho Boost and lower its Special Attack in order to pick off weakened foes like Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Zygarde-C.</li> <li>Taunt prevents setup sweepers from taking advantage of Deoxys-A once it has used Psycho Boost and stops the use of recovery moves from Pokemon like Necrozma-DM, Mega Scizor, Lugia, and support Arceus formes.</li> <li>A set with Nasty Plot / Psychic / Dark Pulse / Ice Beam or Thunderbolt equipped with a Focus Sash lets Deoxys-A function as a potent sweeper. However, this set needs Psychic Terrain support to be effective, since its sweep is easily cut short by priority users otherwise.</li> <li>A lead set with Stealth Rock / Taunt / Psycho Boost / Knock Off or Low Kick can be considered. This set leads better than Deoxys-S against priority users like Rayquaza and Extreme Killer Arceus, since it avoids the mind game of whether to use Taunt. It also forces the opponent to let a Pokemon take a lot of damage from Psycho Boost or lead off with a passive Pokemon like Ferrothorn or Alolan Muk that can stand up to its attacks, which Deoxys-A's teammates can take advantage of. However, Deoxys-S generally does a better job as a lead otherwise.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Choice Scarf users like Xerneas, Yveltal, Lunala, Ho-Oh, and Rayquaza outspeed Deoxys-A and can easily revenge kill it due to its frailty. Priority users like Marshadow, Yveltal, Rayquaza, and Extreme Killer Arceus can OHKO Deoxys-A with their attacks.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Yveltal revenge kills Deoxys-A either by outspeeding it with a Choice Scarf or by using Sucker Punch, but it doesn't appreciate being hit by Ice Beam on the switch. Arceus-Dark and Chople Berry Tyranitar can survive one Superpower from full health and proceed to OHKO Deoxys-A; Tyranitar can also Pursuit trap Deoxys-A to guarantee its removal. Mega Sableye isn't weak to any of Deoxys-A's coverage options and effortlessly deflects entry hazards from lead variants, but it can be 2HKOed by Ice Beam on the switch. Alolan Muk is a niche but solid answer that avoids the 2HKO from all of Deoxys-A's attacks and can Pursuit trap it or pick it off with Shadow Sneak.</p> <p><strong>Necrozma-DM: Necrozma-DM's 4x resistance to Psychic-type attacks makes it a huge nuisance for Deoxys-A, since it prevents the latter from mindlessly spamming Psycho Boost. Support variants avoid the 2HKO from Dark Pulse and can use Morning Sun to heal off any damage dealt or set Stealth Rock as Deoxys-A is forced out. Offensive variants are 2HKOed by Dark Pulse, but they can easily tank one and proceed to steal momentum from Deoxys-A by using Rock Polish or Trick Room, potentially gaining boosts in the process if holding a Weakness Policy.</p> <p><strong>Other Steel-types</strong>: Magearna, Mega Scizor, Celesteela, and Klefki resist Psycho Boost and aren't weak to Superpower, so Deoxys-A has difficulty breaking past them. Mega Scizor and Celesteela additionally have access to recovery, meaning they cannot easily be worn down. However, Mega Scizor is OHKOed by Fire Punch, and Magearna and Klefki still take substantial damage from Superpower.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>STAB Psycho Boost deals massive damage to most Pokemon that don't resist it. However, the move harshly lowers Deoxys-A's Special Attack, making it prone to being forced out or being used as setup fodder afterwards.</li> <li>Ice Beam hits common Psychic-type switch-ins like Yveltal, Ultra Necrozma, and Lugia super effectively and OHKOes Zygarde-C and Mega Salamence. Its decently high Base Power, perfect accuracy, and good neutral coverage make it an attractive option to pick off weakened foes without incurring unnecessary stat drops from Psycho Boost.</li> <li>Superpower hits Dark- and Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Arceus-Dark, and Tyranitar and lets Deoxys-A muscle past Chansey and Blissey. It's preferred over Low Kick because it deals more damage to light targets like Magearna, Klefki, and Chansey and Blissey, although it has the downside of becoming weaker with each consecutive use.</li> <li>Pursuit lets Deoxys-A trap Mega Gengar, which it naturally forces out; Pursuit trapping utility is appreciated by teammates like Arceus-Fairy that are vulnerable to Mega Gengar. It's also useful to ensure damage on other threats such as Ultra Necrozma and Mega Mewtwo Y.</li> <li>Dark Pulse hits Psychic- and Ghost-types like Necrozma-DM, Lunala, and Mega Gengar super effectively. It also hits Ultra Necrozma hard whether or not it decides to Ultra Burst so Deoxys-A isn't forced to guess between Ice Beam and Superpower.</li> <li>Spikes is a good option to take advantage of the many switches Deoxys-A forces. A conservative opponent who constantly switches their defensive answers into Deoxys-A as it uses Spikes will find their team under substantial pressure from Spikes later in the match. It also forces Yveltal into mind games over whether or not it should use Sucker Punch.</li> <li>Knock Off can be used instead of Dark Pulse for its added utility of removing items. This is useful for punishing checks that hold Leftovers like Necrozma-DM, Magearna, and Lugia, as well as for Choice Scarf users like Yveltal and Lunala that may try to pivot into Deoxys-A. However, it's worse against Pokemon that hold irremovable items such as Necrozma-DM with Solganium Z or Ultranecrozium Z and Magearna with Normalium Z.</li> <li>Extreme Speed allows Deoxys-A to pick off faster attackers like Choice Scarf Xerneas and Yveltal once they have been severely weakened.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum Speed investment with a Naive nature lets Deoxys-A outspeed Mega Mewtwo Y and +1 base forme Zygarde.</li> <li>A Rash nature can be used instead to give Deoxys-A more firepower while still letting it outspeed key threats like Mega Gengar, Ultra Necrozma, and Arceus formes. Notably, Deoxys-A gets a much better chance to OHKO offensive Yveltal with Ice Beam and, after Stealth Rock damage, to OHKO bulky Yveltal with Ice Beam and maximum HP Arceus formes with Psycho Boost.</li> <li>Life Orb boosts the damage output of Deoxys-A's attacks, making it much harder to wall. Due to its frailty, Deoxys-A doesn't mind the recoil that Life Orb inflicts.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Deoxys-A is best used as a wallbreaker that punches holes into the opponent's team in order to give teammates an easier time cleaning up.</li> <li>Prediction is a key factor when utilizing this set. Using Psycho Boost as the opponent switches to a Pokemon resistant or immune to it like Necrozma-DM or Choice Scarf Yveltal will cost Deoxys-A a ton of momentum and often force it out afterwards.</li> <li>Be wary of creating setup opportunities for sweepers like Necrozma-DM after using Psycho Boost. If Deoxys-A's teammates cannot handle these sweepers, Deoxys-A should avoid using Psycho Boost until these threats have been removed or sufficiently weakened to the point where they can no longer set up safely.</li> <li>Scout for potential Choice Scarf users like Xerneas and Yveltal, since they outspeed Deoxys-A and can easily OHKO it with their attacks.</li> <li>Despite having a higher base Speed, Deoxys-A is generally forced out by Yveltal even if the latter has been weakened. Choice Scarf variants outspeed Deoxys-A, while non-Choice Scarf variants often carry Sucker Punch. Thus, it's best to catch Yveltal on the switch with Ice Beam or, if possible, completely remove it from play beforehand instead of confronting it directly.</li> <li>Deoxys-A can't really switch into attacks due to its nonexistent bulk. It's best brought in via free or double switches, pivoting moves, or the predicted use of a status move like Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Pursuit should be used against Pokemon that Deoxys-A naturally forces out, such as Mega Gengar and Ultra Necrozma. Note that Pokemon like Gothitelle and Lunala with Shadow Shield intact are likely to stay in against Deoxys-A.</li> <li>Setting Spikes is an aggressive play you can make when you think the opponent will try to pivot around Deoxys-A or sacrifice a Pokemon to it. A switch may be likely if the opponent has a healthy check to Deoxys-A or needs to preserve the Pokemon that they currently have on the field.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Deoxys-A's frailty means that it will have few opportunities to switch in and wallbreak. Thus, it fits primarily on fast-paced offensive teams.</li> <li>Teammates that can pressure Deoxys-A's checks make for good offensive partners. Primal Groudon, Marshadow, and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground pressure Steel-types for Deoxys-A, while Arceus-Fairy and Xerneas deal with Dark-types for it.</li> <li>Setup sweepers like Rock Polish Primal Groudon, Trick Room Necrozma-DM, and Dragon Dance Mega Salamence have an easier time cleaning up once Deoxys-A has punched holes in the opposing team.</li> <li>Geomancy Xerneas and Naganadel are notable partners, since they share checks with Deoxys-A in Necrozma-DM and Magearna. Deoxys-A or its partner can get damage on these checks to increase the likelihood that the other one will sweep.</li> <li>Pokemon that can deal with Deoxys-A's revenge killers are appreciated. Arceus-Fairy and Choice Scarf Xerneas can deal with Marshadow and Yveltal, two of the most common ones. Marshadow offensively checks common priority users such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Mega Lucario. Chople Berry Extreme Killer Arceus lures Marshadow and Mega Lucario for Deoxys-A and can pivot into Choice Scarf Lunala.</li> <li>Tapu Lele provides Psychic Terrain support for Deoxys-A, which augments its wallbreaking and sweeping capabilities. Psychic Terrain negates a key weakness to priority moves and substantially increases the power of Psycho Boost to the point where it can overwhelm even bulky Psychic-resistant Pokemon, such as Magearna and Mega Scizor.</li> <li>Bulky offensive teams can provide VoltTurn support to bring Deoxys-A in safely. Magearna can pivot into Choice Scarf Xerneas and Yveltal, two of Deoxys-A's most common revenge killers, and use Volt Switch to get Deoxys-A in safely. Choice Scarf Yveltal can pivot into Ghost-type attacks from Marshadow and Lunala, while Mega Scizor handily checks Xerneas, and they can use U-turn to bring Deoxys-A in.</li> <li>Entry hazard support is great for wearing down Deoxys-A's checks. Stealth Rock setters like Primal Groudon and Arceus-Fairy keep Pokemon like Ho-Oh and Yveltal in line. Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Klefki are viable Spikes setters, and while some of them don't fit on offensive teams, they can still pair nicely with Deoxys-A. Skarmory can easily handle Necrozma-DM and Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn can switch into Magearna and support variants of Necrozma-DM, and Klefki can pivot into Choice Scarf Xerneas and Yveltal for Deoxys-A.</li> </ul> "

  "Deoxys-Defense": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Deoxys-D is an unviable Pokemon in Ubers due to having too many flaws that seriously harm its only valuable niche as a bulky Spikes setter.</li> <li>Deoxys-D's seemingly excellent bulk, having base 160 Special Defense and Defense, is hindered greatly by its low base 50 HP, which makes it easily overwhelmed by attackers such as Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>It is extremely passive due to having below-average attacking stats, so it usually runs Toxic to make up for it and is thus very susceptible to Taunt.</li> <li>Deoxys-D also has a terrible defensive typing in Psychic, which lacks resistances, makes Deoxys-D vulnerable to all entry hazards and status, notably Toxic, and gives it common weaknesses to Ghost- and Dark-types and U-turn. Notably, Mega Gengar is able to trap and remove Deoxys-D with minimal effort.</li> <li>Because of these traits, Deoxys-D is almost completely outclassed by other bulky Spikes setters such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Klefki, all of which have better defensive typings and can check a larger range of threats, even when accounting for Deoxys-D's faster Taunt.</li> <li>Deoxys-D is a waste of a teamslot and should never be used on a serious team.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Stealth Rock is an option to let Deoxys-D use its free turns to set up multiple entry hazards for its team. However, choosing this amplifies Deoxys-D's four-moveslot syndrome, and many other Stealth Rock setters such as Primal Groudon and Dialga do this better, while Spikes is almost unique to Deoxys-D, so Stealth Rock isn't usually a good option.</li> <li>Ice Beam threatens to 2HKO Mega Salamence, Rayquaza, and Zygarde-C and also helps prevent Deoxys-D from being completely shut down by Taunt. However, this will only threaten them on the switch and does not do much damage to Pokemon that aren't weak to it because of Deoxys-D's lackluster Special Attack.</li> <li>Magic Coat punishes Pokemon that attempt to set up hazards or inflict Deoxys-D with status by deflecting it back at the opposing Pokemon. However, Magic Coat is reliant on correct prediction to work, and failure to predict correctly can lead to Deoxys-D giving the opponent a free turn.</li> <li>Skill Swap prevents Mega Gengar and Mega Sableye from countering Deoxys-D by swapping their abilities, which benefits Deoxys-D while it is on the field. However, it isn't useful for anything else, so it typically isn't worth using a moveslot.</li> <li>Psycho Boost threatens to OHKO Mega Gengar and Marshadow after at least two layers of Spikes, potentially eliminating two of Deoxys-D's worst matchups. However, running Psycho Boost also worsens Deoxys-D's four-moveslot syndrome and leaves it vulnerable to Dark-types.</li> <li>Shed Shell can be run over Leftovers to give Deoxys-D a better matchup against Mega Gengar, allowing it to switch out against Mega Gengar, but this prevents Deoxys-D from receiving much-needed passive recovery, forcing it to use Recover to heal more than it should.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Magic Bounce</strong>: Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie prevent Deoxys-D from doing anything while it is in, as they can simply bounce back any move directed at them. However, they're unable to check Deoxys-D if it chooses to run Skill Swap.</p> <p><strong>Taunt Users: Faster Taunt users such as Deoxys-S and Mega Mewtwo Y render Deoxys-D completely useless, as Deoxys-D is very passive and rarely runs attacking moves.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Mega Gengar traps and 2HKOes Deoxys-D, and the vulnerability is worsened if it is carrying Taunt, which makes Deoxys-D completely unable to do anything to Mega Gengar and forces Deoxys-D to use Struggle. Life Orb Marshadow 2HKOes Deoxys-D with an unboosted Spectral Thief and can also Pursuit trap Deoxys-D.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Calm Mind Arceus-Dark can remove Toxic with Refresh, is unaffected by Deoxys-D's other moves with the exception of Taunt, and can 2HKO Deoxys-D with an unboosted Judgment. Life Orb Yveltal can OHKO Deoxys-D with Dark Pulse and use Taunt so that Deoxys-D can't inflict status on it. Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar and Alolan Muk threaten to OHKO Deoxys-D if it tries to switch out.</p> <p><strong>Faster Setup Sweepers: Setup sweepers that are faster than Deoxys-D such as Mega Lucario and Swords Dance and Calm Mind Arceus formes can set up in front of Deoxys-D and KO it.</p> <p><strong>Status: Toxic poison and burn will gradually wear down Deoxys-D during the battle, forcing it to constantly use Recover when on low health.

However, choosing this spread means sacrificing a lot of bulk that allows Deoxys-D to avoid getting 2HKOed by Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Switch Deoxys-D in early-game to set up Spikes. If a slower and passive Pokemon such as Skarmory or Ferrothorn is switched into Deoxys-D, use Taunt so Deoxys-D can continue to set up.</li> <li>Deoxys-D's main priority is to use its bulk and relatively high Speed to set up Spikes and punish Defog users with Toxic. However, Deoxys-D itself should also worry about Toxic and entry hazards.</li> <li>Use Deoxys-D's free turns carefully, since its passivity and vulnerability to many common threats means it should stay in for a few turns at most.</li> <li>Set up Spikes whenever it is safe to do so. Deoxys-D's poor matchup against the majority of the tier makes setting up Spikes infrequent.</li> <li>Use Taunt whenever necessary. If you know that the opposing Pokemon, likely a setup sweeper, Defogger, or hazard setter, is slower than Deoxys-D, it is safest to use Taunt so Deoxys-D can set up Spikes without being threatened.</li> <li>If you predict that a faster Defog user, setup sweeper, or hazard setter will switch into Deoxys-D, either use Taunt to prevent the Pokemon from Defogging or setting up or use Toxic to wear down the Pokemon over time if it isn't immune to it.</li> <li>If possible, you can try to PP stall a Pokemon like Necrozma-DM with Pressure, which can help Deoxys-D's team be less worried about it breaking through.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Pokemon that can check Dark-types such as Xerneas, Magearna, and Arceus-Fairy are mandatory teammates. The former two can also provide cleric support for Deoxys-D.</li> <li>Dark-types like Arceus-Dark and Yveltal can take out Ghost-types that threaten Deoxys-D, such as Lunala and Giratina. All of the aforementioned Pokemon greatly benefit from Spikes, as all of their checks, with the exception of Ho-Oh, are grounded and do not like to be worn down by Spikes damage.</li> <li>Since Mega Gengar and the Magic Bounce users Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie are the biggest threats to Deoxys-D, Pokemon that can check them such as Pursuit trappers, Fairy-types, and Steel-types are necessary. Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar and Alolan Muk threaten to OHKO Mega Gengar if it tries to switch out; of these, Alolan Muk is much more reliable, since unlike Tyranitar it isn't vulnerable to the rare Focus Blast. Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy can beat Mega Sableye, and Steel-types like Necrozma-DM can beat Mega Diancie. Strong Stealth Rock setters like Primal Groudon, Arceus-Fairy, and Dialga can set up Stealth Rock on Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie due to their ability to overpower them with super effective or strong neutral attacks. Specifically, Arceus-Fairy is a good check to Mega Sableye, and Primal Groudon and Dialga are good checks against Mega Diancie. These Pokemon can also form a hazard stacking core with Deoxys-D.</li> <li>Pokemon that can switch into Toxic such as Necrozma-DM and Toxapex are very useful partners for Deoxys-D, as they can help keep Deoxys-D from being worn down continually.</li> <li>Setup sweepers and wallbreakers such as Swords Dance Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence, Double Dance Necrozma-DM, and Mega Lucario all greatly benefit from Spikes support, as it helps wear down many of the bulkier Pokemon that the sweepers might not be able to take out without support and make landing OHKOs easier.</li> </ul> "

For example, if Deoxys-S doesn't run Skill Swap, it is completely shut down by Magic Bounce users such as Mega Sableye, and if it doesn't run Magic Coat, then it loses to opposing Magic Coat users and is forced to risk a Speed tie against opposing Deoxys-S that aren't running Magic Coat.</li> <li>Although it is considered one of the best dedicated leads in the game, its worst matchups tend to be versus other dedicated leads in the tier—especially ones that are able to remove hazards such as Excadrill, Cloyster, and Smeargle.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Dual screens with Light Clay can be run; however, Deoxys-S can't really afford to run them without sacrificing something important in its moveslots.</li> <li>Psycho Boost is a useful option to catch Mega Gengar and Mega Lucario off guard and deal damage to anything that manages to use Taunt on it with the exception of Yveltal. However, this style of suicide lead is more successfully done by Deoxys-A.</li> <li>Superpower can also be used to hit lead Excadrill, but it tends not to be worth forgoing a move, and it will still have an unfavorable matchup in the entry hazard war.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Opposing Suicide Leads</strong>: Focus Sash lead Excadrill, Smeargle, and Cloyster are particularly troublesome, as they're able to set entry hazards, remove hazards, and almost always beat Deoxys-S in a one-on-one situation. Opposing Deoxys-S are also quite troublesome to face, as they can either shut your Deoxys-S down with Magic Coat, or potentially win a Speed tie and Taunt Deoxys-S, rendering it useless.</p> <p><strong>Priority: Priority users tend to limit Deoxys-S to a single turn on the battlefield, thus rendering it unable to set more than one hazard. Furthermore, common priority users in the tier are able to potentially completely prevent Deoxys-S from setting any hazards at all, as they can force it to use Taunt in order to prevent them from setting up. Common examples of these are Rayquaza, Marshadow, and Extreme Killer Arceus. Giratina-O is also a noteworthy priority user, as it can 2HKO Deoxys-S with Shadow Sneak, and then use Defog to clear any hazards away once Deoxys-S has been KOed.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce: Pokemon with the ability Magic Bounce such as Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie force Deoxys-S to run Skill Swap in order to have it effectively act as a dedicated lead. If Deoxys-S is not running Skill Swap, it is completely shut down by these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Magic Coat and Taunt: Magic Coat can render Deoxys-S completely useless, especially if it isn't running Magic Coat itself, since Deoxys-S doesn't run any attacking moves, and unlike against Magic Bounce users where Deoxys-S is likely to to either avoid the matchup entirely or just use Skill Swap, Magic Coat will either lead to mind games if facing an opposing Deoxys-S, or it'll come completely as a surprise from Pokemon that don't typically run Magic Coat, such as Arceus or Giratina-O. Similarly, if a Pokemon uses Taunt versus Deoxys-S, it is then rendered useless. Fortunately, Prankster users are very rare, so Deoxys-S tends to be able to reliably set at least one entry hazard, but it still doesn't appreciate being afflicted with Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Defog</strong>: Although Deoxys-S is able to use Taunt on Defog users in order to prevent them from removing hazards, Defog users such as Giratina-O, Yveltal, Xerneas, Arceus-Ground, and Arceus-Water tend to beat Deoxys-S in a one-on-one scenario due to the fact that Deoxys-S runs no attacks. Therefore, it has to rely on offensive pressure from other teammates in order to prevent hazards from being removed from the field once it has been KOed. Giratina-O is an especially annoying foe, as it can 2HKO Deoxys-S with Shadow Sneak as well as remove hazards with Defog.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Stealth Rock is mandatory on just about every competitive team, punishing everything in the tier that switches in.</li> <li>Taunt is really good for preventing opposing Pokemon from boosting, spreading status, or trying to set up or remove hazards.</li> <li>Magic Coat is really useful versus opposing Deoxys-S, Smeargle, and Shuckle as well as the rare Pokemon with the ability Prankster.</li> <li>Skill Swap is nice for punishing Magic Bounce users such as Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie.</li> <li>Spikes is a really effective means of punishing grounded Pokemon, as it deals up to 25% of the maximum HP in damage to any Pokemon that switches in.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum HP and Speed EVs and a Timid nature mean that Deoxys-S is able to set entry hazards quickly and survive as many hits as possible while doing so.</li> <li>The Focus Sash allows Deoxys-S to set up at least two layers of hazards or alternatively allows Deoxys-S to more freely use Taunt and not be punished by hard-hitting setup sweepers such as Primal Groudon and Xerneas that choose to attack on the turn that Deoxys-S opts to use Taunt, as it can rely on its Focus Sash to survive any attack and then still freely set up a layer of hazards before it's KOed.</li> <li>Alternatively, a spread with 248 HP / 232 Def / 24 Spe and a Rocky Helmet can be used to outspeed Deoxys-A while maximizing bulk, or if you wish to creep Choice Scarf Xerneas and Yveltal, a spread with 200 Speed EVs can be used. The Rocky Helmet allows Deoxys-S to break opposing Focus Sashes as well as punish spinners and priority users, which it is otherwise unable to do, since it doesn't run any attacking moves. This does, however, make prediction against setup sweepers more of an issue, as using Taunt when the foe chooses to attack can result in Deoxys-S being OHKOed by hard-hitting attackers such as Primal Groudon and Rayquaza and unable to set up hazards altogether.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Deoxys-S should be used early-game so that the opposing team is pressured by hazards as soon as possible.</li> <li>Do not prioritize setting hazards if your opponent leads with a setup sweeper such as Xerneas, Groudon, or Mega Lucario as the teams that Deoxys-S tends to fit well on tend not to appreciate dealing with Pokemon who have boosted their stats.</li> <li>Deoxys-S isn't able to prevent hazards from being removed from the field once it has been KOed; therefore, it needs to be placed on teams that force the foe to attack or switch or be punished heavily for clicking Defog.</li> <li>Deoxys-S struggles immensely against Rapid Spin users such as Cloyster and Excadrill. In those cases, it is better to lead with something that can pressure those Pokemon instead of having Deoxys-S fight a losing battle.</li> <li>If Deoxys-S is not running Skill Swap, do not bring it in against Mega Sableye or Mega Diancie, as they both completely shut it down, so you're better off using other offensive Pokemon to pressure them such as Xerneas and offensive Primal Groudon variants. That being said, bringing in Deoxys-S invites in Magic Bounce users, so double switching once Deoxys-S has been brought in can be quite useful to gain momentum.</li> <li>If Deoxys-S is not running Magic Coat, avoid facing opposing Deoxys-S that may have it, as Magic Coat completely shuts Deoxys-S down and basically guarantees that your opponent can get hazards up.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Deoxys-S fits best on hyper offense builds consisting of a dedicated lead and five offensive threats to break through opposing teams, as offensive threats tend to encourage users to either attack or recover off any damage that's been taken, preventing them from having the opportunity to use Defog.</li> <li>Xerneas is a brilliant partner for Deoxys-S, as it is able to punish any Pokemon in the tier that tries to click Defog by setting up with Geomancy and then sweeping through teams. It also really appreciates having the entry hazards on the field, as it makes its common checks a lot easier to dispose of.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM and Primal Groudon act as good partners, as they're able to act as checks to Xerneas, as well as maintain offensive pressure. Both of these Pokemon also have access to boosting moves and therefore can punish Pokemon that use Defog, as it can potentially allow them a free turn of setup. They also appreciate the fact that Deoxys-S runs Stealth Rock, freeing them up to run setup moves and sweep through teams.</li> <li>Mega Salamence and Rayquaza make useful partners, as they provide teams with a Ground immunity and make great late-game sweepers due to their ability to sweep after boosting with Dragon Dance.</li> <li>Priority users such as Marshadow, Arceus, and Mega Lucario are useful for sweeping through teams and are hard to revenge kill due to their use of priority moves. Mega Lucario can revenge kill Xerneas, and Marshadow is one of the only offensive checks to Arceus in the tier.</li> <li>Fast Taunt users such as Mega Mewtwo Y, Mega Gengar, and Yveltal to a lesser extent are incredibly useful partners for Deoxys-S, as they can outspeed support Arceus formes and use Taunt on them before they can clear entry hazards with Defog. Mega Gengar is especially useful, as it can trap support Arceus-Water and potentially eliminate it, preventing it from removing hazards. While Yveltal might lack the Speed that Mega Gengar and Mega Mewtwo Y boast, it is the only viable Taunt user that's able to deal with Giratina-O, as none of the other relevant Taunt users appreciate taking Shadow Sneaks.</li> <li>Spinblockers such as Giratina-O, Lunala, and Marshadow are useful to help deal with Rapid Spin users such as Excadrill, Cloyster, and Smeargle. Marshadow can make a particularly useful option, as all of these spinners are weak to Fighting-type attacks.</li> </ul> "

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Mega Lopunny's access to a fast Healing Wish gives it a place on certain offensive teams, as it can fully restore a weakened wallbreaker or setup sweeper and essentially give them a second chance to pressure the opposing team.</li> <li>Slower offensive Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM are often tasked with taking strong hits early-game to check threats such as Xerneas, eventually wearing them down, and a quick Healing Wish can turn the tide of the battle in your favor by restoring their HP and curing them of status.</li> <li>Mega Lopunny's high Speed tier also lets it outpace and revenge kill key threats such as Mega Gengar, Ultra Necrozma, and Marshadow, although residual damage is still required to pick them off.</li> <li>Poor Attack and bulk mean Lopunny will heavily rely on Toxic Spikes and Fake Out to chip targets into range of its attacks, or else it will risk being weakened or KOed itself, and it will struggle to clean up healthy teams.</li> <li>Because it relies on Toxic Spikes to beat down support Arceus formes and other grounded targets, the few viable users of this move like Toxapex and Cloyster are often almost mandatory on builds utilizing Mega Lopunny. Forgoing the use of these Toxic Spikes users will limit what Mega Lopunny is able to do in a specific match.</li> <li>Taking up the Mega slot means Mega Lopunny faces severe competition from other more viable Mega Pokemon that are easier to fit on teams such as Mega Gengar, Mega Salamence, and Mega Scizor, somewhat restricting teambuilding, as they don't require specific team support to function. Mega Gengar is also much better at exploiting Toxic Spikes, as it can trap its targets and attack with a strong status-boosted Hex, while Mega Salamence and Mega Scizor provide their respective defensive utilities to the team.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Low Kick is an accurate alternative to High Jump Kick, as many Pokemon in Ubers are heavy enough to the point where Low Kick reaches 120 Base Power, although the extra 10 Base Power that High Jump Kick provides is important for 2HKOing support Arceus formes with a little chip damage.</li> <li>Ice Punch lets Mega Lopunny OHKO Mega Salamence after Stealth Rock damage without factoring Intimidate, and it 2HKOes offensive Zygarde-C. Losing out on Fake Out or Healing Wish can be an awful trade, however.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Toxapex</strong>: Toxapex is easily the biggest nuisance for Mega Lopunny, as it takes little damage from any of its attacks, has Regenerator to keep itself healthy, can punish its contact moves with Rocky Helmet, and soaks up Toxic Spikes, which Mega Lopunny heavily relies on. Its access to Haze also stops any Healing Wish recipient such as Necrozma-DM or Zygarde-C from freely setting up on Toxapex.</p> <p><strong>Support Arceus formes: Support Arceus formes such as Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Water, and the lesser-used Arceus-Dragon all avoid the 2HKO from High Jump Kick when at full HP and boast reliable recovery, meaning Mega Lopunny will require entry hazards or prior chip damage to break past these targets.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde-C: Defensive Zygarde-C can take multiple hits from Mega Lopunny, heal off any residual damage and remove status with Rest, and proceed to cripple it with Glare, essentially making it useless outside of using Healing Wish if the team lacks cleric support. Dragon Dance variants can use Mega Lopunny as setup fodder if it lacks Encore, although Z-Moves like Groundium Z and Dragonium Z will bypass the Encore and KO Mega Lopunny.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Arceus-Fairy has access to reliable recovery, stomachs Mega Lopunny's attacks with ease, and can OHKO it with STAB Judgment. Geomancy Xerneas avoids the 2HKO from Return from full HP and OHKOes Mega Lopunny with Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Foes: Bulky Psychic-types like defensive Lunala, Lugia, Mega Slowbro, and Mega Latias resist High Jump Kick and take little from Return, walling Mega Lopunny and crippling it with super effective STAB attacks or status. Mega Venusaur, Giratina, and Giratina-O avoid the 2HKO from Mega Lopunny's attacks and cripple it with Toxic, Will-O-Wisp, or STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Defensive Ho-Oh, Mega Salamence, and Arceus-Flying resist High Jump Kick and avoid the 2HKO from Mega Lopunny as long as Stealth Rock is kept off the field and can thus beat it down. Physically defensive Yveltal and Skarmory are hit neutrally by High Jump Kick, but their high physical bulk lets them avoid the 2HKO and retaliate with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Faster Foes: Mega Mewtwo Y outspeeds Mega Lopunny and OHKOes it with Psystrike, while Choice Scarf users such as Xerneas, Yveltal, and Ho-Oh outspeed Mega Lopunny and can easily revenge kill it from full HP; however, Mega Mewtwo Y and Xerneas dislike taking repeated Fake Outs.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Fake Out lets Mega Lopunny guarantee chip damage on targets such as Primal Groudon, Xerneas, and Primal Kyogre, putting them in range of its attacks later in the match. This also allows Mega Lopunny to rack up a turn of Toxic Spikes damage and anti-lead versus Smeagle, Excadrill, and Cloyster, safely breaking their Focus Sash and KOing them the next turn.</li> <li>Return is the most reliable Normal-type STAB move Mega Lopunny is able to use.</li> <li>High Jump Kick is a high-Base Power Fighting-type STAB move that allows Mega Lopunny to heavily damage targets hit super effectively by it such as Ferrothorn and Arceus-Dark, as well as 2HKOing some neutral targets such as Primal Kyogre and Magearna.</li> <li>Healing Wish is a big part of Mega Lopunny's niche, allowing it to sacrifice itself to fully restore a teammate and cure it of any status. Its high Speed complements this move well, as it enables it to utilize Healing Wish before being KOed by a strong attack.</li> <li>Encore can be a useful option over Healing Wish, as Mega Lopunny outspeeds +1 offensive Zygarde-C and can thus lock it into Dragon Dance, although it fails to outspeed +1 Zygarde pre-transformation. Encore also helps lock defensive walls such as Arceus-Fairy and Toxapex into status moves such as Recover.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>A simple EV spread of maximum Attack and Speed investment lets Mega Lopunny hit as hard and as fast as possible, outpacing foes such as Mega Gengar, Ultra Necrozma, and Marshadow.</li> <li>Lopunnite is required to let Lopunny Mega Evolve.</li> <li>Limber is the best possible base ability, as it prevents paralysis from moves like Thunder Wave, Glare, and Nuzzle.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>It's not always ideal to lead off with Mega Lopunny, as it allows Pokemon such as Arceus-Fairy and Toxapex to get their respective entry hazards up early. Your opponent will also avoid leading with common suicide leads such as Smeargle, Excadrill, and Cloyster due to the threat of Fake Out. Assess the matchup and attempt to predict your opponent's lead.</li> <li>If your opponent does end up leading with something with a positive matchup versus Mega Lopunny, such as a support Arceus forme, use Fake Out to chip the target and switch out the next turn to an appropriate answer to the threat at hand. Avoid using Fake Out against likely Rocky Helmet users like Toxapex and Skarmory, however.</li> <li>Fake Out is also a powerful tool for chipping setup sweepers such as Rock Polish Primal Groudon, Dragon Dance Mega Salamence, and Geomancy Xerneas, potentially halting a sweep or bringing the target into KO range of a teammate.</li> <li>Due to its frailty and lack of resistances, Mega Lopunny should be brought out through aggressive double switches into targets it can threaten such as Ferrothorn and Arceus-Dark or after one of its teammates has been KOed. Repeatedly getting Mega Lopunny on the field safely can be very important against more offensive teams that lack defensive walls.</li> <li>Setting up entry hazards is very important to ensure Mega Lopunny can pull its weight in a match. Get Toxic Spikes up early to cripple support Arceus formes and force a Rest from defensive Zygarde-C, and set up Stealth Rock to pressure Flying-type Defoggers such as Mega Salamence, physically defensive Yveltal, and Ho-Oh.</li> <li>If a certain member of your team such as Necrozma-DM or Zygarde-C is weakened, always try to assess Mega Lopunny's importance in the matchup, as a fast Healing Wish can bestow a second chance for one of your wallbreakers or sweepers or even bring back a weakened defensive wall that took a heavy hit or crippling status earlier in the match. Mega Lopunny can even bait in its checks such as Arceus-Fairy and Xerneas and use Healing Wish as they switch in, allowing free setup to teammates such as the aforementioned Necrozma-DM.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Trick Room or Double Dance Necrozma-DM can be a great partner for Mega Lopunny, as Healing Wish support allows it to wallbreak more recklessly early-game and take strong hits if needed, and in return it can KO or weaken some of Mega Lopunny's answers such as Zygarde-C, Choice Scarf Yveltal, and Arceus-Ground. Although using Trick Room Necrozma-DM may seem counterintuitive, since Mega Lopunny is a fast offensive threat, it boasts higher bulk than its Double Dance counterpart, which is important for dealing with Xerneas and Mega Salamence better.</li> <li>Swords Dance + Stealth Rock Primal Groudon can beat down defensive walls such as Arceus-Water, Arceus-Fairy, and Zygarde-C as well as bulky Flying-types such as Ho-Oh and Mega Salamence that all trouble Mega Lopunny, helping it to clean up late-game. Other variants of Primal Groudon also work well, such as Rock Polish, which can poke holes into defensive cores early-game and then be a recipient of Healing Wish if sweeping with Primal Groudon is more likely than cleaning up with Mega Lopunny.</li> <li>Dragon Dance Zygarde-C complements Mega Lopunny well, as it's also another common Pokemon that can utilize Toxic Spikes with Substitute + Protect variants, which will eventually overpower support Arceus forms while having great matchups versus some of its other checks such as Toxapex, Ho-Oh, and opposing defensive Zygarde-C.</li> <li>Toxapex provides Toxic Spikes support, statusing support Arceus formes and Zygarde-C upon entry and chipping them in range of a 2HKO from Mega Lopunny, and acts as an answer to Choice Scarf Xerneas and Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Although it provides little defensive utility and isn't as consistent as Toxapex, Cloyster is an alternative Toxic Spikes setter, as it can easily set a layer of Toxic Spikes while deterring entry hazard removal attempts early on in the match due to Shell Smash and its STAB Icicle Spear.</li> <li>Giratina-O easily fits on offensive teams as a Defogger, and its ability to cripple defensive walls such as Arceus-Fairy with Toxic or paralyze offensive threats like Yveltal with Thunder Wave lets it aid Mega Lopunny in cleaning up teams.</li> <li>Arceus-Dark can be an excellent teammate because it can handle certain threats such as Yveltal, Ultra Necrozma, and Lunala, as they can all survive hits from Mega Lopunny when sufficiently healthy and OHKO it back.</li> </ul> "

Thus, Mega Lucario is primarily placed on hyper offense playstyles.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>A special set can be run with Nasty Plot, Vacuum Wave, Flash Cannon, and either Focus Blast or Aura Sphere. However, this set is outclassed by the physical set, as it relies on Mega Lucario's lower Special Attack stat, has to rely on a 70% accurate move in Focus Blast for decent damage output because Aura Sphere doesn't even 2HKO Blissey, and prevents Mega Lucario from being able to revenge kill Xerneas, Marshadow, and Mega Gengar.</li> <li>High Jump Kick can be used over Close Combat, as a +2 High Jump Kick has a chance to OHKO Zygarde after Stealth Rock damage, but it is far less spammable than Close Combat, since Lucario risks losing 50% of its health if the move misses or if the opponent switches to a Ghost-type Pokemon.</li> <li>An all-out attacking set with Meteor Mash, Close Combat, Ice Punch, and Earthquake can be used with Mega Lucario, which solves the problem of Lucario being walled by certain Pokemon; however, this means that its offensive presence isn't as dominating and it has to forego priority, thus making it less efficient at revenge killing.</li> <li>Agility is an option that can be considered on Mega Lucario, placing it in a Speed tier where it's less prone to being revenge killed, but Mega Lucario doesn't really have the space in its moveslot for it, and it doesn't really have the bulk to pull off a Double Dance set.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Toxapex</strong>: Toxapex resists both of Mega Lucario's STAB moves and can remove any of Mega Lucario's boosts with Haze, recover off any damage with Recover, and potentially burn it with Scald. It does have to be careful of the rare Earthquake, though.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde-C</strong>: Zygarde has enough physical bulk to survive a +2 Close Combat even prior to becoming its Complete forme and can dish out heavy damage with Thousand Arrows. Defensive sets can also recover off any damage with Rest, paralyze Lucario with Glare, and phaze it with Dragon Tail. It does have to be careful for the rare Ice Punch, though, and it has a chance to be OHKOed after Stealth Rock by +2 Close Combat if it hasn't transformed yet.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh hard counters any set that is not running Stone Edge, as it resists both of Lucario's STAB moves and can OHKO it with Sacred Fire. It does have to be cautious switching into Mega Lucario if Stealth Rock is up, especially if it's at +2.</p> <p><strong>Marshadow</strong>: Marshadow is arguably the biggest offensive threat to Mega Lucario, as it outpaces Mega Lucario, has enough bulk to survive a +2 Bullet Punch, and can steal Mega Lucario's boosts with Spectral Thief.</p> <p><strong>Lugia</strong>: Lugia is 4x resistant to Fighting-type attacks, has enough natural bulk to not be too bothered by Lucario's Steel-type attacks, and can phaze it with Whirlwind. However, it does struggle to check a +2 Mega Lucario if Stealth Rock is up.</p> <p><strong>Arceus Formes</strong>: Arceus formes all tend to run enough Speed investment to specifically outpace Mega Lucario. Arceus-Ground can OHKO with Judgment or Earthquake, Arceus-Water dishes out heavy damage with Judgment and resists Steel-type attacks, and Arceus-Fairy also dishes out heavy damage with Judgment, but it doesn't appreciate switching into Steel-type attacks. Furthermore, both Arceus-Water and Arceus-Fairy occasionally run Fire Blast, which OHKOes Mega Lucario.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar: Mega Gengar outspeeds Mega Lucario and is able to OHKO it with Focus Blast, dish out heavy damage with Shadow Ball or Hex, or potentially trade KOs with Destiny Bond. However, Mega Gengar does not appreciate taking Steel-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Flying-type Pokemon</strong>: Flying-type Pokemon such as Arceus-Flying and Mega Salamence pose a great threat to Mega Lucario, as they tend to outpace Mega Lucario and are immune to Sticky Web, so they are able to revenge kill Mega Lucario even if the hazard is on the field. While Mega Salamence often tends to run an Adamant nature over a Jolly nature, it cuts Mega Lucario's Attack by one stage prior to Mega Evolving and is able to OHKO it with an Aerilate-boosted Double-Edge. It is also worth noting that Double-Edge from Jolly Mega Salamence OHKOes Mega Lucario.</p> <p><strong>Status: While Mega Lucario's Steel typing allows it to be immune to Poison, it is heavily crippled by burns and paralysis, as burns cut its Attack in half and paralysis cuts its Speed in half, thus making it easy to revenge kill.</p> ",

Yveltal also appreciates Mega Lucario's ability to threaten Xerneas, Arceus Fairy, and special walls such as Chansey and Blissey.</li> <li>Primal Groudon is a brilliant partner for Mega Lucario, as it sets up Stealth Rock, which weakens opposing Pokemon and makes it easier for Mega Lucario to sweep late-game. This is especially useful for dealing with Ho-Oh and Lugia, as Ho-Oh's HP is reduced by 50% if it switches in when Stealth Rock is on the field, and Lugia's ability to check Mega Lucario is reduced if its Multiscale is broken. Primal Groudon also provides teams with a primary check to Xerneas, which means that Mega Lucario either doesn't have to deal with it at all or has an easier time revenge killing it with Bullet Punch. Furthermore, Primal Groudon is able to easily deal with Toxapex, beat Marshadow one-on-one, and KO Ho-Oh if it opts to run a Rock-type attack.</li> <li>Primal Kyogre is a useful partner for Mega Lucario, as it threatens physically defensive Primal Groudon, Zygarde-C, Arceus-Ground, and Ho-Oh, all of which either outspeed Mega Lucario or have enough natural bulk to be able to survive a +2 Close Combat. Primal Kyogre also appreciates Mega Lucario's ability to break through many of its defensive checks such as Chansey, Blissey, and Ferrothorn.</li> <li>Xerneas has brilliant offensive synergy with Mega Lucario, as it is able to easily break through teams and deal with foes such as Yveltal, Zygarde-C, and Marshadow. Choice Scarf sets can also act as a cleric, removing burns or curing paralysis on Mega Lucario. Xerneas also appreciates Mega Lucario's ability to break through or weaken many of Xerneas's checks such as Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, Primal Groudon, Chansey, and Blissey.</li> </ul> "

  "Dialga": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Dialga's niche in Ubers as a Stealth Rock user when compared to Necrozma-DM comes from its offensive presence against the majority of Defog users in the tier, such as Arceus-Water, Arceus-Dragon, and both formes of Giratina.</li> <li>A decent Steel / Dragon typing of paired with great natural bulk makes it hard to take down Dialga in general. Its handy immunity to Toxic also allows it to switch into passive foes and set Stealth Rock multiple times throughout the match.</li> <li>A wide array of coverage and status moves available for Dialga makes it very hard to defensively handle without dedicated special walls.</li> <li>Despite these strengths, Dialga faces competition with a lot of other threats in the metagame; as an offensive Pokemon, Palkia and Zekrom are better offensive checks to Primal Kyogre, have better offensive typings, and can run lure sets to defeat their conventional checks. As a Stealth Rock user, Dialga faces heavy competition with Necrozma-DM, which is more resilient to super effective moves thanks to Prism Armor and has reliable recovery to consistently set entry hazards throughout the match.</li> <li>Dialga's defensive typing leaves it unable to check Xerneas. This forces Dialga's team to acquire a check to Xerneas by employing another Steel-type, stacking weaknesses while doing so.</li> <li>Dialga also falls prey to very common threats like Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, Marshadow, and Mega Lucario due to its weakness to Ground- and Fighting-types. Although Shuca Berry allows Dialga to survive a hit and retaliate against Ground-type threats and Earthquake users, its matchup against the aforementioned threats are risky nonetheless.</li> <li>Lastly, Dialga suffers from four-moveslot syndrome; it is mandated to carry Stealth Rock to fulfill its role and therefore lacks moveslots to fit all coverage and status moves it needs.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Dialga is the most potent when it is used as an offensive Stealth Rock setter while functioning as either a Life Orb attacker or an offensive check to certain threats with Shuca Berry. Other dedicated offensive sets are mostly outclassed by Palkia due to it having a better offensive typing and Speed tier.</li> <li>Flash Cannon punishes Fairy-types that attempt to switch into Draco Meteor, but it doesn't do much else and thus has a hard time fitting in Dialga's already strapped moveset.</li> <li>Trick Room is an interesting option to utilize Dialga's mediocre Speed, but the prevalence of Arceus formes, lack of a setup move, and reliance on a Z-Crystal to KO foes make this difficult to function well in practice.</li> <li>Roar prevents Dialga from being setup fodder after it has used Draco Meteor and can potentially allow Dialga to lure Xerneas and waste its Power Herb if it sets up Geomancy expecting Dialga to either switch or be too weak to do much back.</li> <li>Thunder Wave is an alternative status move available but is mostly inferior to Toxic due to its inability to punish Defog users.</li> <li>Chople Berry surprises Marshadow and Mega Lucario and allows Dialga to KO them back with Draco Meteor and Fire Blast, respectively. However, Dialga can handle much more significant and a wider array of threats with Shuca Berry instead.</li> <li>Leftovers provides passive recovery but comes at the cost of power from Life Orb or extreme vulnerability to Ground-type foes and Ground-type attacks by forgoing Shuca Berry.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Arceus-Ground has enough bulk to shake off damage taken from Dialga's attacks, Recover to keep itself healthy, Defog to remove Stealth Rock from the field, and Judgment to at worst rid Dialga of Shuca Berry. Primal Groudon, while losing the majority of its health from Draco Meteor, easily 2HKOes Dialga with its STAB moves or sets Stealth Rock of its own while Dialga is forced out. Despite this, it is important to note that both Arceus-Ground and Primal Groudon despise switching into Toxic. Landorus, although it struggles taking most attack from Dialga in general, can at worst weaken Dialga with their super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Marshadow, Mega Lucario, Mega Blaziken, and Mega Mewtwo X easily OHKO Dialga with their super effective STAB moves. However, the former three are OHKOed by Draco Meteor or Fire Blast if they carelessly switch into Dialga.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Without employing Flash Cannon, the best Dialga can do against Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy is setting them on a timer with Toxic. They can switch into any Dialga variant lacking those moves with ease thanks to their immunity to Draco Meteor.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls: Ho-Oh switches into Dialga without much concern thanks to its huge special bulk and is resilient to most damage taken thanks to Regenerator, although it takes heavy damage from Thunder. Lugia and most support Arceus formes have enough bulk to take on Dialga, and support Arceus formes in particular often carry Defog to clear away entry hazards. Chansey and Blissey are impossible for Dialga to surmount due to their enormous special bulk and Natural Cure, which removes Toxic poison upon switching out. However, Ho-Oh and Lugia cannot switch into Dialga without risk when Stealth Rock is up and are put on a timer by Toxic, and support Arceus formes also have their defensive capabilities greatly hindered by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazard Removers: Excadrill threatens Dialga with Earthquake and uses Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock while setting said hazard itself. Some Xerneas variants carry Defog and are able to remove hazards while forcing out Dialga.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Stealth Rock greatly benefits setup sweepers such as Xerneas, Mega Salamence, Rayquaza, and Arceus by wearing down the opposing team. The move also allows threats like Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM to run more offensive sets.</li> <li>Draco Meteor is a very powerful STAB move that puts a dent on most targets that do not resist it. It comes at a cost of a drastic drop in Special Attack, however.</li> <li>Fire Blast punishes Steel-types such as Celesteela, Ferrothorn, Magearna, and defensive Necrozma-DM that resist Draco Meteor.</li> <li>Thunder does heavy damage to Arceus-Water, Primal Kyogre, Ho-Oh, Lugia, and Celesteela, but it sometimes tends to be unreliable due to its shaky accuracy.</li> <li>Toxic punishes foes that hope to take Draco Meteor and Fire Blast from Dialga, such as Arceus formes, Ho-Oh, and Lugia, by putting them on a timer. It also punishes Xerneas if it tries to set up on Dialga.</li> <li>Ice Beam is an alternative to Draco Meteor that does not force Dialga to switch out, hits Arceus-Ground, and still OHKOes Zygarde-C with Life Orb. This is a plausible option if reserving momentum is more important than access to a powerful STAB move.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>The given EV spread allows Dialga to outspeed Adamant Necrozma-DM, letting it reliably score a 2HKO with Fire Blast.</li> <li>Full Special Attack investment with a Modest nature maximizes Dialga's damage output to the point where Draco Meteor forces a recovery move from Arceus formes by taking away around half of their health.</li> <li>Life Orb increases Dialga's damage output at the cost of its longevity and allows Dialga to OHKO offensive Primal Groudon with Draco Meteor after Stealth Rock, OHKO Celesteela and 2HKO defensive Necrozma-DM with Fire Blast, and 2HKO bulky Ho-Oh with Thunder.</li> <li>Shuca Berry allows Dialga to survive a Precipice Blades from Primal Groudon and take Earthquake from various threats, such as Mega Salamence, Ultra Necrozma, and Rayquaza, that rely on said move to defeat Dialga. Shuca Berry can be paired with an alternative EV spread of 240 HP / 16 Def / 252 SpA in order to survive +1 Tectonic Rage from Zygarde-C from full HP.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Dialga should avoid leading against the likes of Excadrill, Cloyster, and Deoxys-S, since they can either remove entry hazards or prevent Dialga from setting hazards in the first place.</li> <li>Draco Meteor is best used against neutral targets to either heavily damage them or force them to use a recovery move so Dialga can potentially gain a turn to set Stealth Rock, use Toxic to put them on timer, or switch into a counter.</li> <li>Toxic is a great way to punish Defog users that are able to take Dialga's attacks, such as Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Water. The former especially is inclined to switch into Dialga to heal off the damage taken while forcing it out, so it is best to use Toxic on it as it switches in.</li> <li>Switching into Toxic from predictable users of the move like Lugia and Arceus-Water allows Dialga to easily grab an opportunity to set entry hazards or fire attacks, since it forces out said foes due to them not being able to do much in return.</li> <li>Dialga is quite reliant on predictions to punish switch-ins with its moves. Draco Meteor shouldn't be used recklessly when Steel-types are likely to switch in, and Toxic should be used when Arceus formes are the most likely switch-ins. This is especially important if Dialga has to avoid taking hits to preserve its health while utilizing its moveset to full potential.</li> <li>It is important to make right decisions about whether to use Dialga early-game as a dedicated lead or preserve it to check sweepers that it can at full health. For instance, if Dialga holds Shuca Berry and is the only reliable answer to dangerous sweepers like Mega Salamence and Rayquaza, it should be preserved and left healthy so it can deal with them later in the match. If Dialga does not have to stay healthy to handle a specific threat that none of its teammates can't already, it should set Stealth Rock as early as possible to start pressuring the opposing team.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Checks to Primal Groudon are necessary, since Dialga cannot handle it alone, even with Shuca Berry. Support Arceus formes mostly do a sufficient job handling Primal Groudon and are able to occasionally run Fire Blast to free Dialga of a moveslot to run a different move. Lugia is able to prevail against setup variants of Primal Groudon while handling Mega Lucario.</li> <li>Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM appreciate the Stealth Rock support Dialga provides. They benefit from said entry hazard when attempting to sweep and are free to use more offensively oriented sets that they could not use otherwise when dedicating their movesets to set the hazard themselves. The former checks Fairy-types and threatens Steel-types for Dialga in the event Dialga does not run Fire Blast and appreciates Dialga switching into Toxic while using Toxic of its own to put support Arceus formes on timer. The latter is also a strong check to Fairy-types and enjoys Steel-types weakened from Dialga's Fire Blast.</li> <li>Xerneas enjoys Stealth Rock support, which weakens Ho-Oh and removes Multiscale from Lugia, and appreciates Dialga luring Steel-types and denting them with Fire Blast. In return, Xerneas resists Fighting-type moves and threatens any Defog users that Dialga cannot handle by threatening to set up Geomancy on them.</li> <li>Yveltal is an offensive powerhouse that pairs well with Dialga. It provides a Ground immunity to the team, which Dialga appreciates, and is able to use Taunt to prevent Defog and shut down special walls like Chansey. Choice Scarf variants are good checks to Marshadow and Lunala.</li> <li>Marshadow meets a lot of important benchmarks with Stealth Rock up and appreciates Dialga threatening support Arceus formes. In return, Marshadow can switch into predicted Fighting-type attacks, block Rapid Spin, and destroy most special walls in the tier.</li> <li>Mega Salamence appreciates Stealth Rock support as well as Dialga weakening support Arceus forms with powerful attacks or Toxic. In return, Mega Salamence acts as a good check to Primal Groudon and provides a Ground-type immunity for Dialga, letting it avoid unwanted matchups and preserve Shuca Berry.</li> <li>Arceus-Ground appreciates Dialga luring Steel-types like Celesteela and punishing them with Fire Blast. This allows Arceus-Ground to sweep easily with Swords Dance. Defensive variants of Arceus-Ground serve as strong checks to Primal Groudon and Mega Lucario, which Dialga struggles with.</li> <li>Ho-Oh resists Fighting-, Fairy-, and Steel-types that Dialga might have trouble with if it does not have appropriate coverage against them. It also appreciates Dialga using Toxic on support Arceus formes and threatening Giratina and Zygarde-C with Draco Meteor.</li> </ul> "

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Palkia excels as a wallbreaker thanks to its mighty base 150 Special Attack and abundance of powerful STAB and coverage options. Very few defensive Pokemon can stand up to its powerful blows.</li> <li>Base 100 Speed places Palkia just ahead of many common Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Xerneas, and Yveltal.</li> <li>Defensively, Palkia's typing and decent bulk enable it to check Primal Kyogre effectively. They also enable it to switch somewhat decently into Steel-types such as Celesteela and Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>However, a general lack of resistances means that Palkia's defensive utility is extremely limited outside of handling a few specific Pokemon.</li> <li>Because both of its STAB moves are blocked by very threatening Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Xerneas, Palkia can be a hit-or-miss Pokemon in battle, as it depends very much on its attacks finding the correct mark.</li> <li>Palkia's lack of Speed-boosting options makes it extremely limited against offensive teams.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Palkia can use Psychium Z in conjunction with Heal Block to grant it a one-time +2 boost to its Special Attack. While this can be devastating against certain defensive cores, Palkia will lose the boosts if forced out, which makes the consistent power of Life Orb a better choice most of the time.</li> <li>Substitute eases prediction and combines well with Focus Punch, but it forces Palkia to give up a valuable coverage move.</li> <li>Lustrous Orb gives Palkia a consistent boost to its STAB moves without incurring Life Orb recoil. However, Palkia will lose the ability to OHKO Blissey and will become less effective at damaging specific important targets such as Lugia and Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>Trick Room allows Palkia to turn the tables on offensive teams by gaining this Speed advantage at the tradeoff of greatly worsening its performance against defensive teams by sacrificing both a coverage move and its raw Speed stat.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Arceus-Fairy</strong>: Arceus-Fairy is the best general answer to Palkia, boasting an immunity to Dragon-type attacks and the bulk to shrug off Palkia's other moves with Recover. It naturally outspeeds Palkia and can swiftly KO with Judgment.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Other Fairy-types such as Xerneas, Mega Diancie, and Magearna can switch in on Palkia's Dragon-type attacks and KO it with their own STAB moves, but most are threatened by Hydro Pump.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Strong Pokemon that are faster than Palkia can usually KO it before it can act thanks to its lack of resistances. Mega Salamence, Marshadow, Mega Lucario, Deoxys-A, Naganadel, and Ultra Necrozma are a few examples, though none of them can switch directly into Palkia.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon: Primal Groudon is immune to Water-type moves and not bothered by most of Palkia's coverage, KOing it in return with Precipice Blades. However, Dragon-type attacks will inflict heavy damage onto Primal Groudon, so it can't switch into Palkia without some risk.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Chansey</strong>: If Palkia lacks Focus Punch, Blissey and Chansey can switch into it without fear and stall it out with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Lugia</strong>: Lugia can take Palkia's attacks with the help of Multiscale, recovering until Life Orb or Toxic damage take their toll. However, Lugia cannot switch directly into Palkia if Stealth Rock is up.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Palkia is greatly hampered by most status conditions: paralysis ruins its Speed, Toxic puts it on a timer, and burn prevents it from effectively using Focus Punch against Blissey. Any of these will make Palkia easier to handle.</p> ",

Furthermore, Hydro Pump threatens a 2HKO on most bulky Steel-types that may try to switch in on a Dragon-type move.</li> <li>Spacial Rend is the preferred option for a Dragon-type STAB move due to a good mix of power and consistency, destroying any opposing Dragon-type it touches. Even specially defensive Primal Groudon is 2HKOed after Stealth Rock damage.</li> <li>Draco Meteor, on the other hand, provides more burst damage for certain targets. It notably has a decent chance to OHKO offensive Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock damage.</li> <li>Thunder allows Palkia to reliably 2HKO Primal Kyogre and OHKO Celesteela after Stealth Rock damage. Thunder's paralysis chance also makes it a useful tool for Palkia to deal with Lugia.</li> <li>Focus Punch cleanly OHKOes Blissey, which can otherwise switch into Palkia with impunity. Focus Punch will also leave Ferrothorn in critical-enough health to be taken out by Hydro Pump next turn.</li> <li>Fire Blast can be used instead to cleanly OHKO Ferrothorn and do more damage to Steel-types in general. However, Palkia cannot beat Blissey without Focus Punch, highly limiting its effectiveness against most stall teams. Furthermore, Fire Blast does not outdamage Hydro Pump against Necrozma-DM, one of the most common Steel-types in the metagame, thanks to Prism Armor.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Palkia's Special Attack is maximized to optimize damage output.</li> <li>Maximum Speed with a Hasty nature allows Palkia to outspeed all non-Choice Scarf variants of Xerneas and Yveltal and below without weakening Focus Punch.</li> <li>A Mild nature gives Palkia more power while still retaining the ability to outspeed Xerneas and Yveltal if they do not run a Speed-increasing nature themselves.</li> <li>If not using Focus Punch, a Timid or Modest nature can be used instead to leave Palkia's bulk intact.</li> <li>A Naive or Rash nature may also be used to help Palkia switch more comfortably into physical variants of Primal Kyogre and Sunsteel Strike from Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Life Orb maximizes Palkia's offensive strength while retaining flexibility in move choice.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Although Palkia can be switched directly into a Pokemon it checks, such as Primal Kyogre or Necrozma-DM, it is generally better brought into battle when it doesn't need to take a hit, such as after a teammate is KOed, on a double switch, or through the use of U-turn or Volt Switch. This helps conserve Palkia's HP, as it lacks many resistances to exploit.</li> <li>Scouting for certain threats such as Choice Scarf Xerneas or Arceus-Fairy can be helpful to ensure Palkia's attacks are not wasted.</li> <li>Switching into Palkia is a daunting prospect for the foe, but choosing which move it should use can be a bit tricky, as both Hydro Pump and Spacial Rend have common immunities. One can make a more informed choice by taking into consideration Palkia's teammates. For example, if Palkia has Xerneas as a teammate, the opponent may be more willing to risk their Fairy-type against Palkia instead of Primal Groudon, allowing you to act accordingly.</li> <li>Focus Punch is best saved for an anticipated switch to Blissey. Bear in mind that the opponent can scout for Focus Punch if Palkia tries to use it when Blissey is already on the field.</li> <li>Try not to let Palkia get statused, as it may cut its longevity too short to be truly effective against a defensive team.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM cover Palkia against Fairy-types and provide Stealth Rock support to help get targets such as Lugia into Palkia's KO range. Both are also effective at softening up support Arceus formes through Toxic or powerful attacks.</li> <li>Because Palkia excels against defensive teams but falters against offense, it appreciates teammates that help cover it against the latter matchup. Marshadow and Choice Scarf users such as Xerneas and Yveltal are excellent anti-offense Pokemon. Yveltal is also an adept user of U-turn, granting extra switch-in potential. Rock Polish Primal Groudon and Double Dance Necrozma-DM are sweepers that can easily dismantle offensive teams as well.</li> <li>Mega Scizor and Magearna cover Palkia's weaknesses to Dragon- and Fairy-type attacks, and they can use U-turn or Volt Switch to help get Palkia into the fray.</li> <li>Swords Dance Arceus-Ground checks Primal Groudon and is a good choice to clean up once Palkia has dismantled the enemy's defensive core. It also appreciates Palkia's ability to switch into Primal Kyogre.</li> </ul> "

Apart from being offensive checks, both Xerneas and Magearna have access to cleric moves, and Arceus-Fairy can set Stealth Rock while Giratina is forced out.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types and Ghost-types: Yveltal and Arceus-Dark are offensive checks to Giratina due to their typing. While Yveltal is hindered by well-timed Toxic, Arceus-Dark with Refresh does not mind status moves. Ghost-types are more threatening, as Mega Gengar, Giratina-O, and Lunala are all capable of OHKOing Giratina after Stealth Rock under the right conditions. Giratina-O and Lunala despise switching into Toxic, however.</p> <p><strong>Magic Bounce Users: Due to the fact that Giratina cannot afford to employ any attacking moves, it is useless against Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie. Mega Diancie is especially troublesome due to its typing and ability to set Stealth Rock on a forced switch. Mega Sableye, however, cannot significantly threaten Giratina and despises getting PP stalled.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Giratina usually does not carry any attacking moves, and it is easily shut down by Taunt users like Mega Gengar, Yveltal, and Mega Gyarados as a result.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Users: Giratina lacking Roar is completely shut down by Substitute users like Zygarde-C, Arceus-Ground, Primal Kyogre, and Extreme Killer Arceus, and they can freely set up while avoiding status.</p> ",

A healthy Giratina can handle many boosted attacks and respond with a status move or Roar. In order for this to be possible, one of the clerics on your team has to cure Giratina as fast as possible after it has used Rest so foes that would otherwise be walled by Giratina won't freely set entry hazards or set up.</li> <li>Though Giratina is bulky enough to survive strong attacks when healthy, it must be wary of possible Z-Move users like Necrozma-DM and Arceus-Ground, as a boosted Z-Move is capable of outright OHKOing Giratina. If Giratina's Defog support is desired in the long run, refrain from recklessly taking on the aforementioned foes until their movesets and items have been identified.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>As Giratina cannot function effectively without its teammates and is very passive, it is best fit on stall teams. Cleric support is mandatory, and Blissey can fulfill this role well, as it also avoids Shadow Tag trapping with Shed Shell, wakes up Giratina with Heal Bell, checks Fairy-types and Calm Mind Arceus formes, and can easily switch into most attacks and status moves from support Arceus formes. Magearna is also a valid option for similar reasons, and it can handle Dark-types well. Common clerics paired with Giratina appreciate Giratina's ability to cover their vulnerability against Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Steel-types.</li> <li>Although Giratina is a good Defog user in its own right, it is recommended to pair it with another Defog user or even a Magic Bounce user, as repeated attacks will eventually draw Giratina to the point where it is forced to use Rest and be left asleep until it yields a significant amount of momentum or a cleric cures its status. Ho-Oh is a good choice, as it can take more offensive approaches to punish Steel-types, check Fairy-types, Yveltal, and Lunala, and aid Giratina with spreading status. Support Arceus formes are also solid Defog users and additionally blanket check Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Marshadow depending on their typing. Arceus-Dark deserves a special mention, as it is not vulnerable to Shadow Tag users, checks Ghost- and Dark-types, and appreciates Giratina's ability to keep Primal Groudon and Fighting-types in check. Skarmory can switch into Toxic for Giratina, provide utility in phazing for Giratina lacking Roar, and notably stand against Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Fairy, and Necrozma-DM with Stealth Rock without much struggle.</li> <li>Ho-Oh can also fit alongside Giratina and provide offensive and defensive utility. Ho-Oh appreciates Giratina's Defog support and ability to spread burns which improves its matchup against physical attackers. Lugia also appreciates Defog support, as it cannot utilize Multiscale when Stealth Rock is on the field. In return, Lugia can employ Ice Beam to deal with Substitute variants of Zygarde, which use Giratina lacking Roar as setup fodder. Lugia also can blanket check some formidable threats to stall teams, such as physically oriented Primal Kyogre and Swords Dance Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Primal Groudon aids Giratina in various ways. It checks Fairy-types and Primal Kyogre, sets Stealth Rock, threatens Steel-types, and makes up for Giratina's passivity to a large extent. In return, Giratina can check opposing Primal Groudon and support Arceus-Ground and cripple Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Ferrothorn and Toxapex can fit with Giratina thanks to their ability to check Fairy-types. They are also able to provide entry hazard support that Giratina can take advantage of with Roar. Ferrothorn also checks Primal Kyogre, while Toxapex checks Marshadow. Both of them appreciate Giratina checking Primal Groudon. It is important to note, however, that neither of them are reliable checks to Xerneas.</li> </ul> "

  "Giratina-Origin": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Giratina-O is one of the premier Defog users in the tier and is commonly found on many balanced teams due to a formidable combination of utility options it provides.</li> <li>Great bulk, Levitate, and a defensive typing of Ghost / Dragon make Giratina-O a check to many physically oriented threats, such as Primal Groudon, Swords Dance Arceus formes, Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, and Mega Salamence.</li> <li>When accounting for Giratina-O's solid defensive typing, enormous bulk, inability to be trapped, access to various status moves, and, most importantly, offensive presence, there are very few Pokemon in the tier that can reliably set entry hazards against, switch into, or combat it.</li> <li>An advantageous matchup against the most relevant Stealth Rock user, Primal Groudon, is one of the major factors to Giratina-O's viability as a Defog user as well. Many Pokemon on balanced teams struggle to properly deal with Primal Groudon due to a large number of sets it can run to circumvent its checks, and Giratina-O stands as one of the safest switch-ins to Primal Groudon due to its ability to handle most variants.</li> <li>An ability to defeat common threats like Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and many support Arceus formes in one-on-one scenarios, depending on its moveset, serves as Giratina-O's other attractive trait to balanced teams that need a Defog user capable of restricting many Pokemon from taking advantage of it.</li> <li>Giratina-O's effectiveness as a check to threats it pivots into will vary depending on its health due to its tendency to handle its foes offensively or with status moves. An average Speed tier means that Giratina-O will likely be attacked before it is able to counteract, which combined with a complete lack of recovery and an obligation to pivot into strong powerhouses like Primal Groudon makes its health management important.</li> <li>Prevalent special attackers like Xerneas, Yveltal, and Mega Gengar and other special attackers like Lunala and Deoxys-A can easily overwhelm Giratina-O and threaten to OHKO or heavily impair it. Other common offensive threats like Marshadow and Outrage Ultra Necrozma can exploit Giratina-O's weaknesses to circumvent its bulk.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>A physically based set with Defog, Dragon Tail, Shadow Sneak, and Earthquake or Shadow Force provides Giratina-O with a stronger priority move and a way to 2HKO Magearna without statusing it beforehand. However, this set is helpless against Fairy-types, struggles to combat Primal Groudon, and is easily taken advantage of by Ferrothorn. Dragon Tail's inability to prevent Extreme Killer Arceus from setting up with Substitute against Giratina-O also leaves this option fairly disappointing.</li> <li>Magic Coat can be used to reflect status and entry hazard moves from suicide leads like Deoxys-S and various Pokemon that rely on Toxic to combat Giratina.</li> <li>Rest is Giratina-O's only form of recovery, but it can only be used effectively with cleric support, and Giratina-O has a hard time justifying its use over any listed move. As Giratina-O is immobile while asleep, Rest ends up being a detriment due to the sleep turns and its tendency to allow Giratina-O's offensive checks to switch in freely, along with entry hazard setters taking advantage of Giratina-O without fear.</li> <li>Roar can be used to deal with setup sweepers behind Substitute and possibly make Geomancy Xerneas waste its Power Herb, but this move is very hard to fit.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Both Xerneas and Magearna can switch into Dragon-type moves and threaten Giratina-O with their STAB moves. Both of them also have access to cleric moves to cure status that Giratina-O aims to spread as well. However, Choice Scarf Xerneas with Aromatherapy will be forced to heal its status right away if switched into Thunder Wave, and Geomancy variants will be punished harder if switched into said move. Arceus-Fairy has access to recovery moves to consistently switch into Giratina-O, but it has similar concerns about getting paralyzed, which will make it vulnerable to getting 2HKOed by boosted Hex from Giratina-O.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Offensive Yveltal can cleanly OHKO Giratina-O with Dark Pulse, and defensive variants typically carry Taunt that prevents Giratina-O from using Defog or status moves. However, Yveltal dislikes switching into Thunder Wave and Toxic, and offensive variants have to be wary about switching into Draco Meteor when Stealth Rock is up. Arceus-Dark has enough bulk to take on most Giratina-O variants, and variants carrying Refresh does not mind Giratina-O at all, apart from being forced to use Recover after switching into Draco Meteor. Tyranitar can force out Giratina-O while setting Stealth Rock and additionally guarantee a heavy hit on it with Pursuit. Even after getting burned, Tyranitar is a huge nuisance for Giratina-O due to the residual damage from sandstorm and potential Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey: Both Chansey and Blissey have enormous special bulk to take any attack from Giratina-O with ease, Natural Cure to absorb status, and Heal Bell to heal its teammates of status ailments.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: While Ghost-types almost never find opportunities to switch into Giratina-O, they can offensively check it if given a safe switch. Mega Gengar, Lunala, and Marshadow are all able to threaten Giratina-O, but they must be wary of Shadow Sneak and avoid switching into Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Attacks: Super effective moves like Ice Beam from Arceus formes prevent Giratina-O from effectively dealing with them, while more offensive foes like Ultra Necrozma, mixed Rayquaza, Palkia, and Dialga can threaten to OHKO Giratina-O with their super effective attacks.</p> <p><strong>Status: Giratina-O's already limited longevity is further worsened by burn and poison, and paralysis can be detrimental as well due to its potency to potentially prevent Defog.</p> ",

        "name": "Defog",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Giratina-O's ability to force switches with its strong attacks and check Primal Groudon makes it an effective Defog user.</li> <li>Hex provides Giratina-O with an immensely powerful attack against statused foes. Hex is one of the major factors that contribute to Giratina-O's offensive presence due to it 2HKOing foes like Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Magearna, and the majority of the support Arceus formes once they've been statused.</li> <li>Dragon Pulse is a consistent secondary STAB move that isn't reliant on status. Dragon Pulse also has a sizable damage output despite its mediocre Base Power, doing enough damage to 2HKO most offensive Primal Groudon variants after Stealth Rock damage and outright OHKO offensive Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Draco Meteor provides Giratina-O with a Dragon-type STAB attack with more immediate damage output, forcing recovery moves from support Arceus formes that attempt to absorb damage and threatening to OHKO Yveltal and offensive Ho-Oh after Stealth Rock damage. Draco Meteor also pressures Primal Groudon significantly harder than Dragon Pulse, weakening defensive variants to the point where it can no longer pivot into threats like Necrozma-DM and Xerneas and putting offensive variants in range of priority moves. However, its tendency to force Giratina-O out after attacking a foe and worsen its matchup against Substitute Extreme Killer Arceus makes it a less favorable move than Dragon Pulse.</li> <li>A status move is used in the fourth moveslot to enable Giratina-O to use boosted Hex and punish a variety of its switch-ins. Thunder Wave cripples support Arceus formes, Yveltal, and Xerneas, making them much easier to check. Paralysis allows Giratina-O to threaten support Arceus formes by threatening to 2HKO them with boosted Hex, and it comes in handy with punishing Xerneas, forcing Choice Scarf variants to lock themselves into Aromatherapy and making Geomancy variants significantly easier to handle. Thunder Wave especially comes in handy where Giratina-O isn't healthy enough to win duels against foes like Mega Lucario, enabling its teammates to handle them more easily.</li> <li>Will-O-Wisp is an alternative status move that pressures Steel-types harder with residual damage and cripples Necrozma-DM, Mega Lucario, and Swords Dance Arceus formes.</li> <li>Toxic can be used to pressure Primal Groudon and punish Giratina-O's checks harder in the long run, serving as the only status move that can pressure support and Calm Mind variants of Arceus-Ground, which would otherwise not mind too much about Giratina-O's other moves. However, choosing Toxic as a status move removes Giratina-O's ability to 2HKO specially defensive Necrozma-DM, and it is usually better for Giratina-O to use Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp and let its teammates spread Toxic poison to foes like Primal Groudon and support Arceus formes.</li> <li>Giratina-O can forgo Hex for Shadow Ball and give up a status move for Shadow Sneak to have a consistent Ghost-type STAB attack and a priority move, which can be handy with picking off faster threats like Mega Gengar and Deoxys-A and setup sweepers. A combination of Shadow Ball and Shadow Sneak is also capable of preventing Cloyster from setting up entry hazards. Note that Giratina-O will have to opt for a Quiet nature with this option to maximize Shadow Sneak's damage.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>248 HP and 52 Special Defense EVs allow Giratina-O to survive two full-powered Eruptions from Primal Groudon.</li> <li>The remaining EVs are put into Special Attack with a Modest nature, which, combined with a mandated Griseous Orb, improve Giratina-O's offensive presence, limiting its switch-ins and enabling it to offensively check a large portion of the tier.</li> <li>If Thunder Wave is run, 28 Speed EVs should be used to outspeed Modest Choice Scarf Xerneas and Yveltal once they have been paralyzed.</li> <li>Running 152 Speed EVs may be an appealing option if using Will-O-Wisp, as this enables Giratina-O to burn Necrozma-DM before Necrozma-DM OHKOes Giratina-O with +2 Searing Sunraze Smash. Note that this costs a noticeable portion of Giratina-O's damage output or bulk, however.</li> <li>Maximum Defense investment can be used instead of maximum HP investment to take physical attacks better. This can come in handy against Pokemon like Necrozma-DM and Swords Dance Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>Levitate provides Giratina-O with an immunity to Ground, improving its matchup against Primal Groudon and Swords Dance Arceus-Ground.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Making the best use of Giratina-O requires somewhat cautious play, despite it often being a pivot that is intentionally sent out against Primal Groudon and certain entry hazard setters. Giratina-O will inevitably sustain damage and will be worn down over the course of the match, and this means Giratina-O should be somewhat focused on managing its HP.</li> <li>Giratina-O should be quick to decide whether combating a foe and taking damage outweighs lessening the chance it can take on other threats it may be tasked to handle. Taking damage and removing entry hazards with Defog is beneficial for Giratina-O's team, but staying in the field unnecessarily long to take an extra attack or increase the odds of getting inflicted by status will only make Giratina-O get worn down faster.</li> <li>Primal Groudon and Swords Dance Arceus formes are the most common foes that Giratina-O should stay in against to prevent them from dealing excessive damage to other teammates. While these threats may be easier to keep in check with a healthy Giratina-O when they attempt to wallbreak early- or mid-game, it will be much more difficult to stop them as the game gets longer and Giratina-O keeps taking damage. Unless there are reliable checks to said foes other than Giratina-O, ensure that Giratina-O is healthy enough to win the duel against them.</li> <li>Against bulkier teams with durable entry hazard setters like defensive Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, and Arceus formes using Stealth Rock, Giratina-O can choose to act aggressively by statusing them and then damaging them with Hex. While entry hazard setters from bulky teams tend to carry Toxic, this may be a worthwhile move to make if entry hazards are going to be problematic for Giratina-O's team and the setters have to be pressured.</li> <li>Giratina-O will find an opportunity to remove entry hazards from offensive teams if it manages to pivot into an appropriate foe like Primal Groudon or Arceus-Ground. As these Pokemon are common in such archetypes and simply letting Giratina-O switch into them will let it remove entry hazards set by dedicated leads, it is likely that an opponent will seek a way to wear down Giratina-O with Stealth Rock and aggressively double switch into offensive checks like Xerneas and Yveltal, so avoid being too reactive against such teams.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Various support Arceus formes can be beneficial, as, depending on their typing, they can cover Giratina-O's weaknesses and form a good defensive core. With Giratina-O freeing their moveslot by providing Defog support, Arceus formes have more options to be better checks to whichever foe they desire to cover for the team and can cover foes like Zygarde-C and Mega Salamence that will either force Giratina-O to directly combat them to keep them in check or overwhelm it after some prior damage. Arceus-Water is the most notable one, as it can handle most Primal Groudon variants with Giratina-O and can sponge attacks from special variants of Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh, which Giratina-O cannot switch into consistently. Arceus-Dark soft checks Necrozma-DM and Yveltal while benefiting from Giratina-O drawing in and statusing checks like Xerneas.</li> <li>Various Steel-types like Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn can pivot into Toxic and Fairy-type attacks aimed at Giratina-O. Practically any Steel-type appreciates Giratina-O's ability to stand against Primal Groudon and can set entry hazards or spread status in return. Magearna is a notable partner that can pivot into both Xerneas and Yveltal, provide cleric support, and benefit from Giratina-O's Defog support, preventing Spikes from rapidly wearing it down.</li> <li>Stealth Rock users like Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM can prevent defensive Ho-Oh and Yveltal from recklessly switching into Giratina-O and can run Toxic to cripple Defog users and support Arceus formes, giving Giratina-O an easier time to deal with foes that it would need poisoned to deal with.</li> <li>Flying-types enjoy Giratina-O's Defog support and can also function as secondary checks to Primal Groudon offensively or defensively. Ho-Oh is one of the Pokemon that benefit the most from the absence of Stealth Rock to be able to pivot into Fairy-types, absorb status moves reasonably well, pressure Steel-types, check some Primal Groudon variants, and spread status to make Giratina-O's Hex easier to utilize. Yveltal offensively checks Ghost-types, cripples special walls with Taunt, and benefits from Giratina-O's ability to leave Arceus formes crippled by status or a large amount of damage they took while combating it. Mega Salamence can absorb status moves for Giratina-O to use boosted Facade and can have a better chance to sweep after its checks like Steel- and Fairy-types have been pressured by Giratina-O.</li> <li>Mega Gengar and Giratina-O can work together to spread various status ailments and facilitate their attempts to prey on as many foes with boosted Hex as possible. Mega Gengar can trap and dispose of Fairy-types and special walls, while Giratina-O can pivot into threats like Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh that Mega Gengar struggles to deal with. Trapping and removing Stealth Rock users like Arceus-Fairy that Giratina-O cannot effectively deal with is also appreciated.</li> <li>Toxapex can set Toxic Spikes to ease Giratina-O's attempts to damage foes with boosted Hex, take advantage of Arceus-Fairy, and check Marshadow and Ho-Oh. In return, Giratina-O can pivot into Ground-type attacks aimed at Toxapex.</li> <li>Cleric support from Xerneas, Chansey, and Blissey can be helpful to prevent Giratina-O from losing too much HP from status. Chansey and Blissey can also support Giratina-O with Wish to further extend its longevity.</li> </ul> "

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Darkrai is a frail special attacker that differs from Yveltal with its higher Speed tier, access to strong utility moves, and different coverage options.</li> <li>Darkrai's inconsistency should be stressed, however; without landing Hypnosis, it can end up doing very little in a match. This alone is the greatest reason that players avoid using it when aiming for consistent teams.</li> <li>On the flip side, if Darkrai's moves hit their targets, it can be a very difficult Pokemon to handle. Simply the threat of playing with the odds can force the opponent to react defensively to Darkrai, even if luck does not favor it.</li> <li>Darkrai's stats and overall playstyle limit it to offensive teams, and it faces competition from Yveltal in this role, as Darkrai offers very little defensively in comparison.</li> <li>While base 125 Speed is high, allowing Darkrai to outspeed Arceus formes and Mega Salamence and Speed tie with Marshadow, Darkrai still has to be wary of faster threats such as Mega Gengar, Ultra Necrozma, Deoxys-A, Mewtwo formes, and Choice Scarf Xerneas.</li> <li>Even when accuracy is removed from the situation, Darkrai may lack the ideal coverage against Fairy-types or damage against Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Primal Kyogre. Magearna also heavily threatens Darkrai once something else is asleep, meaning that considerable effort and team support is required to get the most out of Darkrai's abilities.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Darkinium Z is a possibility that allows Darkrai to land surprise OHKOs on bulky Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and Primal Kyogre at +2, but +2 Thunder with Life Orb is capable of doing the same thing while providing a consistent damage boost.</li> <li>Firium Z combined with Incinerate turns Darkrai into an effective Magearna lure for a teammate, as a +2 Inferno Overdrive is capable of OHKOing it. This comes with the large opportunity cost of using up the team's Z-Move and making Darkrai very matchup reliant to be somewhat useful, though.</li> <li>Substitute and Leftovers takes advantage of Darkrai's ability to force switches and safely chip away at enemy Pokemon, but this set lacks in coverage and damage overall, making it easier to handle than more offensive sets.</li> <li>Psychium Z alongside Hypnosis increases Darkrai's Speed, avoiding retaliation from the faster attackers that would normally avoid being weak to Dark Pulse by hitting Darkrai first. However, this set has a large opportunity cost as well as a reliance on facing the right Pokemon that the set intends to beat, such as Deoxys-A, Mewtwo, and Ultra Necrozma.</li> <li>A Choice Scarf set with Ice Beam is plausible to work as a revenge killer against Dragon Dance Mega Salamence, Zygarde-C, and Rayquaza. Haze can also be used to remove the boosts from Geomancy Xerneas in a pinch, and the Choice Scarf can be switched to cripple a Pokemon with Trick, but ultimately, a set of this nature has too many downsides to be worth it.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Magearna</strong>: Magearna is the best answer to Darkrai, assuming that Darkrai wasn't able to put it to sleep. With a resistance to Dark Pulse, an immunity to Sludge Bomb, and the ability to cleanly OHKO Darkrai with Fleur Cannon, Magearna fears only a boosted Thunder if it is sufficiently weakened.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Arceus-Fairy and Xerneas act as good Darkrai checks with their high bulk, meaning that a Darkrai lacking Sludge Bomb will need them to be weakened into range of a boosted Thunder. However, due to being slower than Darkrai, these Pokemon are at high risk of being OHKOed by +2 Sludge Bomb should Darkrai be running it. Choice Scarf Xerneas avoids this concern and will always threaten to revenge kill Darkrai if given the chance.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers: While base 125 Speed is relatively high by Ubers standards, Darkrai is still slower than many offensive Pokemon such as Ultra Necrozma, Mewtwo, Mega Gengar, and Deoxys-A, which are all able to threaten to revenge kill it with various moves.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Chansey: The very high special bulk of Blissey and Chansey makes them suitable Darkrai answers. It should be noted that these Pokemon are not capable of absorbing sleep for a teammate due to Natural Cure, however, and if they stay in against Darkrai while asleep, they risk Darkrai boosting with Nasty Plot to a point where it is able to win against them. If another Pokemon is already asleep, Blissey and Chansey are able to stall Darkrai out with Toxic poison.</p> <p><strong>Tyranitar</strong>: A resistance to Dark Pulse and Sludge Bomb when combined with Tyranitar's high Special Defense courtesy of sand make it a good check to Darkrai, fearing only Focus Blast. Tyranitar can whittle Darkrai down with STAB attacks, Toxic, and residual damage from sand.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers</strong>: If Darkrai is lacking Thunder, Ho-Oh and Primal Kyogre can take a boosted attack from Darkrai and retaliate with heavy damage from their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Priority Attacks</strong>: Extreme Speed from the likes of Arceus and Rayquaza as well as Bullet Punch from Mega Lucario and Mega Scizor are capable of bypassing Darkrai's Speed advantage and taking it down if Darkrai is weakened.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Hypnosis may lack in accuracy, but it threatens the opponent with the danger of losing a Pokemon to sleep. This gives Darkrai the ability to freely set up a Nasty Plot and make use of its ability to get bonus chip damage on an enemy Pokemon.</li> <li>Nasty Plot is another key separation that Darkrai has over Yveltal, having more power than it at +2. This can make Darkrai a threatening wallbreaker or sweeper depending on the situation.</li> <li>Dark Pulse is Darkrai's main attack and does respectable damage to the majority of the tier. A boost from Nasty Plot makes Dark Pulse far more threatening to weakened Pokemon.</li> <li>Thunder targets Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Primal Kyogre but comes with more accuracy concerns. While Ho-Oh and Primal Kyogre do not resist Dark Pulse, their high Special Defense allows them to take hits without too much trouble, meaning that a boosted Thunder will be far more threatening to them.</li> <li>Sludge Bomb targets Fairy-types and is a clear advantage that Darkrai has over Yveltal when combined with its Speed tier. With the threat of a +2 Sludge Bomb, Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy are much shakier checks. It also ensures that Darkrai has another accurate attack to rely on.</li> <li>An alternative coverage option is Focus Blast, which is Darkrai's best option against the likes of Tyranitar and Magearna, which are otherwise very effective checks. Dark Pulse and Focus Blast coverage misses out on a lot of important Pokemon such as Fairy-types and Ho-Oh, however.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment with a Timid nature gets the most out of Darkrai's important stats, outspeeding key threats such as Arceus formes and Mega Salamence while maximizing damage output.</li> <li>Life Orb adds the best overall damage to Darkrai's attacks, as without it, it can lose out on OHKOing Ho-Oh at +2 with Thunder and will also fall short of OHKOing Arceus-Fairy and Xerneas with +2 Sludge Bomb. Dark Pulse also gains guaranteed OHKOs on Ultra Necrozma and Mewtwo with the boost from Life Orb.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Darkrai's low bulk and high Speed mean that it is best brought in on free switches against slower, bulkier Pokemon.</li> <li>If Darkrai can force a switch, this gives the chance to use Hypnosis twice if the switch-in is slower, increasing the odds to 84% of gaining a free Nasty Plot or attacking against a sleeping target. This can somewhat offset the annoying accuracy issues that come with Hypnosis.</li> <li>Be aware of what Darkrai isn't capable of beating based on its coverage. Without Sludge Bomb, Darkrai needs Fairy-types to be fairly weakened before a boosted Thunder will take them down. Without Thunder, Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Primal Kyogre will need to be worn down before Darkrai can beat them. Magearna is nearly impossible to break if running Sludge Bomb as the coverage option and will need to be dealt with by Darkrai's teammates.</li> <li>Darkrai is capable of dealing with its own checks with Hypnosis, but the opponent is not likely to give Darkrai the chance to put its own check to sleep and will likely fodder something less useful or a Pokemon that isn't that bothered of being asleep before pivoting back to a Darkrai check. This can be taken advantage of by using Nasty Plot or attacking and keeping the threat of Hypnosis around.</li> <li>Darkrai is capable of being effective against many different types of teams, but keep in mind that ultimately, there will be some reliance on luck going your way to achieve the best results from this set.</li> <li>It should be noted that Darkrai's high Speed and access to sleep-inducing moves can make it an effective anti-lead against slower entry hazard-focused Pokemon such as Cloyster, Smeargle, and Excadrill.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>For Darkrai to avoid being completely outclassed by Yveltal on a team, the overall structure of it should aim to be offensive in nature.</li> <li>Reliable entry hazard setting is a requirement to keep the pressure on the opponent and chip foes into the range of Darkrai's attacks. This can come from dedicated leads such as Cloyster, Deoxys-S, and Excadrill. Primal Groudon also stands out as a Stealth Rock setter and generally reliable teammate. In return, Darkrai can pressure enemy Defog users or even put them to sleep, keeping entry hazards up.</li> <li>Choice Scarf Xerneas stands out as a great partner, as it can threaten to revenge kill many of the Pokemon that are faster than Darkrai while also getting chip damage onto Magearna to put it in range of Darkrai's attacks. In return, Darkrai puts pressure onto other Xerneas checks such as Primal Groudon and support Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Primal Groudon can use a variety of sets, with all of them able to check Fairy-types and Tyranitar for Darkrai. Some variants can be used to pressure Primal Kyogre and Ho-Oh, covering many bases for Darkrai in a single teammate.

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>With a Normalium Z, Shaymin-S is able to utilize Z-Celebrate to increase all of its stats by one stage, which can allow it to function as a late-game cleaner, though it has to give up a moveslot for Celebrate. Furthermore, its checks have to removed or significantly weakened before it can sweep. In a similar vein, Z-Growth can be considered for a +2 Special Attack boost, which makes it easier for Shaymin-S to break slower teams when compared to Z-Celebrate; however, Shaymin-S loses out on the +1 Speed boost that Z-Celebrate provides and thus fails to outspeed Mega Gengar, Ultra Necrozma, and Deoxys-A.</li> <li>A Choice Scarf set turns Shaymin-S into a capable revenge killer, as it allows Shaymin-S to outspeed Pokemon that it wouldn't otherwise be able to such as +2 Geomancy Xerneas, Ultra Necrozma, +1 Mega Salamence, and Mega Gengar, all threats it would otherwise struggle against; however, the lack of power from Life Orb means it is unable to function as a wallbreaker, which is a large downside.</li> <li>Choice Specs can be used over a Life Orb for more power and makes Shaymin-S deal greater amounts of damage while removing the issue of Life Orb recoil, but it makes Shaymin-S unable to switch moves and easier for Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and Magearna to switch into.</li> <li>A set with Substitute and Leech Seed is possible to put some pressure on bulkier teams, being able to use Substitute on passive Pokemon and Leech Seed on switch-ins to wear them down and heal Shaymin-S's HP back, but this set takes away Shaymin-S's coverage options and ability to do any significant damage due to swapping out Life Orb for Leftovers. This set also struggles against offense teams that Shaymin-S is usually able to take care of, and due to its poor bulk, maintaining a Substitute can be difficult.</li> <li>Hidden Power Fire can be considered to hit Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, but it is hard to justify over Shaymin-S's other coverage moves such as Earth Power and Hidden Power Ice, as Shaymin-S is already strapped for moveslots.</li> <li>Hidden Power Rock can be considered for OHKOing Ho-Oh after Stealth Rock, though it doesn't have any other worthwhile targets and is inferior to Hidden Power Ice and Earth Power.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh is able to switch into Shaymin-S with ease and easily takes Air Slash and Seed Flare. Ho-Oh only fears the rare Hidden Power Rock and is able to OHKO Shaymin-S back with Sacred Fire or Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Mega Gengar easily traps Shaymin-S and OHKOes it with Sludge Wave or Icy Wind. Mega Gengar has to be wary of the rare Choice Scarf set, though, as Shaymin-S is able to 2HKO it with Air Slash if it decides to switch in or OHKO it with Earth Power after some chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and specially defensive Necrozma-DM can take Shaymin-S's STAB attacks with ease. Ferrothorn is able to set up entry hazards or do a large amount of damage with Gyro Ball but has to be aware of the rare Hidden Power Fire. Necrozma-DM is able to set up Stealth Rock against Shaymin-S or hit it hard with Sunsteel Strike, but specially defensive Necrozma-DM has to take caution, as it can't handle Shaymin-S after Special Defense drops if it is carrying Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Pokemon such as Ultra Necrozma, Mewtwo, Pheromosa, Deoxys-A, and common Choice Scarf users like Xerneas and Yveltal are able to revenge kill Shaymin-S easily with their strong STAB moves or super effective coverage.</p> <p><strong>Priority: Shaymin-S is frail and can fall to strong priority moves such as Marshadow's Shadow Sneak, Yveltal's Sucker Punch, and Extreme Killer Arceus and Life Orb Rayquaza's Extreme Speed if it has been chipped enough.</p> <p><strong>Residual damage: Shaymin-S is weak to Stealth Rock, and, when combined with Life Orb recoil, the hazards will wear it down very quickly.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Seed Flare allows Shaymin-S to break past walls such as Blissey and Chansey due to its 80% chance to harshly drop Special Defense.</li> <li>Air Slash is Shaymin-S's Flying-type STAB move of choice and has a good chance to make the foe flinch.</li> <li>Earth Power allows Shaymin-S to OHKO Mega Lucario, 2HKO Magearna and Necrozma-DM, and damage Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Toxapex super effectively.</li> <li>Hidden Power Ice can be used over Earth Power if Steel-types aren't a concern for the team and allows Shaymin-S to effectively OHKO Mega Salamence and offensive Zygarde-C before Power Construct has been activated.</li> <li>Healing Wish provides utility in fully healing another teammate that can be used more proficiently and can be used when Shaymin-S is at low HP or isn't required anymore in the matchup.</li> <li>One can decide to forgo coverage moves for Aromatherapy to relieve the team of status if the lack of coverage is sufficiently covered by other teammates.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum Speed investment and a Timid nature allow Shaymin-S to outspeed Marshadow and Darkrai along with fast support Pokemon such as Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Water, and Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Maximum Special Attack investment paired with Life Orb makes Shaymin-S as effective at wallbreaking as possible.</li> <li>Serene Grace complements Shaymin-S's moves greatly and increases its wallbreaking ability. Seed Flare has an 80% chance of harshly dropping Special Defense, which gives Shaymin-S a chance to break past specially defensive walls such as Blissey and Chansey, naturally bulky Pokemon like Giratina, and support Arceus formes such as Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Dark. Air Slash also has a reasonable 60% flinch chance, which can help Shaymin-S bypass targets it usually wouldn't be able to or potentially deter setup from Rock Polish Primal Groudon or Geomancy Xerneas.</li> <li>Metronome can be used over Life Orb if the recoil is a concern. There is a noticeable difference in power, however; Metronome only surpasses Life Orb in damage output after three hits of using same move consecutively. This is only useful in uncommon situations when Shaymin-S needs to flinch down its target with Air Slash.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Shaymin-S is rather frail and can't switch into direct attacks, so it is best to bring it in when predicting the opponent switches or after one of your Pokemon has fainted, allowing Shaymin-S to come in safely.</li> <li>Furthermore, Shaymin-S can get worn down quickly in games due to its frailty and susceptibility to residual damage from Stealth Rock and Life Orb recoil, so it is important to make sure Shaymin-S switches in at the right moment. Shaymin-S being worn down can really reduce how effective it can actually be, as it can be easily taken out by priority attacks from Pokemon it is supposed to threaten such as Marshadow.</li> <li>Avoid trying to rely on multiple Air Slash flinches to KO a target; trying to flinch the foe with Air Slash once or twice is acceptable, but against healthier targets it is better for Shaymin-S to switch out.</li> <li>Seed Flare can force switches due to its 80% chance to drop the foe's Special Defense, so it is best to utilize any free opportunities Shaymin-S gets to use Seed Flare, such as on any targets it immediately threatens out like Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Water, and Primal Kyogre. The high chance of a Special Defense drop gives Shaymin-S a chance to break anything that immediately switches in. It can also further take advantage of this with its coverage moves such as Earth Power, which can OHKO Necrozma-DM and Magearna after a drop from Seed Flare.</li> <li>Once Shaymin-S has reached a low amount of HP or is no longer useful to the team, it is best to use Healing Wish to fully heal one of its teammates such as a setup sweeper like Rock Polish Primal Groudon or Necrozma-DM; however, one should avoid doing this in front of users that carry priority moves such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Marshadow, as they will knock Shaymin-S out, preventing a Healing Wish.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Pokemon that deal with Mega Gengar are essential, as Shaymin-S is susceptible to being trapped and removed by it. Choice Band Tyranitar in particular has good synergy with Shaymin-S and is able to pursuit trap Mega Gengar and break down common Shaymin-S answers such as Chansey, Blissey, and Lugia. Tyranitar is also able to check Yveltal and soft check Ho-Oh. In return, Shaymin-S is able to deal with Tyranitar answers such as Arceus-Ground, Primal Groudon, Zygarde-C, and Primal Kyogre. Pursuit Marshadow and Deoxys-A are able to function on offense teams to revenge kill or Pursuit trap Mega Gengar.</li> <li>Pokemon such as Life Orb Yveltal, mixed Rock Polish Primal Groudon, and Geomancy Xerneas appreciate Shaymin-S's ability to wear down bulky Pokemon with its coverage and Seed Flare such as Arceus formes, Blissey, Chansey, Magearna enough so these Pokemon can break teams further. Life Orb Yveltal complements Shaymin-S well, as it is able to deal with Mega Gengar and Ultra Necrozma for Shaymin-S.</li> <li>Setup sweepers and wallbreakers such as Lunala, Primal Kyogre, Dragon Dance Zygarde, Arceus formes such as Arceus-Ground that utilize offensive sets like Calm Mind or Swords Dance, offensive Primal Groudon variants, and Necrozma-DM appreciate the Healing Wish support Shaymin-S provides, giving them an extra opportunity to sweep or wallbreak in a late-game scenario.</li> <li>Due to Shaymin-S's weakness to Stealth Rock, entry hazard removal options are appreciated. Pokemon such as Cloyster and Excadrill make good potential partners due to their access to Rapid Spin, and they are able to set Spikes and Stealth Rock, respectively. Excadrill in particular makes it easier for Shaymin-S to deal with its switch-ins such as Ho-Oh and Lugia due to its access to Stealth Rock and Toxic.</li> <li>Defog users such as Giratina-O and Mega Salamence can provide an additional Ground immunity, as Shaymin-S is frail and is not sufficient in this role on its own. Mega Salamence in particular is able to check Ho-Oh with Facade. Other Defog users such as Arceus-Water and Arceus-Ground are able to provide a check against Primal Groudon, and Arceus-Water is also able to check Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Primal Groudon has good offensive synergy with Shaymin-S and is able to set Stealth Rock and check Ho-Oh. Primal Groudon also has access to Fire-type moves to punish Steel-types such as Celesteela, Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Necrozma-DM. In return, Shaymin-S is able to deal with Pokemon that threaten Primal Groudon such as Arceus-Ground, Zygarde-C, Primal Kyogre, and Arceus-Water.</li> </ul> "

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Arceus finds itself a niche on offensive teams thanks to its access to a consistent and strong priority move in Extreme Speed. The move also helps with picking off faster weakened threats such as Geomancy Xerneas and Rock Polish Primal Groudon and preventing them from netting excessive damage on the team.</li> <li>Thanks to a lack of weaknesses outside of Fighting and solid bulk, Arceus can act as a blanket check for a good portion of unboosted threats in the tier and easily set up late-game to clean up the opposing team. An immunity to Ghost also grants Arceus an opportunity to occasionally switch into the likes of Lunala.</li> <li>Unfortunately, Arceus is strapped for moveslots, and depending on what moveset and coverage moves it opts for, it will be easily stopped by common walls in the tier, such as Zygarde-C, Celesteela, both formes of Giratina, Skarmory, and Ferrothorn.</li> <li>Arceus is also somewhat vulnerable to revenge killing due to its lack of resistances and the prevalence of many faster threats that are resilient or immune to Extreme Speed, such as Mega Salamence, Ultra Necrozma before Ultra Burst, Mega Gengar, and the worst, Marshadow.</li> <li>Due to Arceus's inconsistent performance that is dependent on matchups, it faces stiff competition from Arceus-Ground, which is more consistent with a stronger STAB move.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Earthquake hits various foes that resist Extreme Speed such as Magearna and Tyranitar super effectively and also nets heavy damage on Primal Groudon after a Swords Dance boost, but is difficult to justify on a set.</li> <li>Life Orb makes a significant change in Arceus's general damage output and allows it to meet various benchmarks, such as scoring an OHKO on Primal Groudon with +2 Earthquake and on offensive Yveltal and Xerneas with +2 Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock damage. The item also boosts coverage moves; for example, Fire Blast can 2HKO Celesteela on switch. However, Arceus is usually inclined to attempt to sweep once its checks and counters are gone to set up as reliably as possible and therefore would naturally be trying to defeat weakened foes. In addition, forgoing Substitute or Chople Berry leaves Arceus very vulnerable to the omnipresent Marshadow, though using this set in Sticky Web lacks concern about this.</li> <li>Stone Edge OHKOes offensive Mega Salamence and defensive Yveltal at +2 after Stealth Rock and OHKOes offensive Ho-Oh. However, this coverage move is quite hard to fit onto a moveset.</li> <li>Ice Beam OHKOes Mega Salamence after Stealth Rock and 2HKOes Zygarde-C with some prior damage. However, Arceus will need significant investment in Speed to hit the former effectively and thus would have to forgo the bulk it would otherwise get from HP investment.</li> <li>Fire Blast 2HKOes Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Mega Scizor, and Buzzwole and does a chunk of damage to Celesteela and Magearna. However, these walls are better dealt with by Arceus's teammates in general.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Ghost-types</strong>: Arceus is forced to rely on Shadow Claw to ever damage Ghost-types in a meaningful way due to their immunity to Extreme Speed. Mega Sableye effortlessly walls any Arceus variant thanks to it taking neutral damage from Shadow Claw. As a result, it easily checks Arceus by using Foul Play or a status move. Both formes of Giratina take even boosted Shadow Claw with their great bulk and can either phaze or status Arceus, although they tend to struggle against Substitute variants.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Ghost-types: Marshadow and Mega Gengar both naturally outspeed Arceus and can revenge kill it thanks to their immunity to Extreme Speed. Marshadow can hit it with Close Combat first if given a safe switch in, and any Arceus set without Chople Berry is outright taken out by Life Orb-boosted Close Combat. Mega Gengar can revenge kill Arceus lacking Chople Berry with Focus Blast, burn it with Will-O-Wisp, or force a trade with Destiny Bond.</p> <p><strong>Lugia: Lugia switches into Arceus with impunity most of the time thanks to its massive bulk that is further complemented by Multiscale, which allows it to handle even boosted Shadow Claw. It easily stalls out Arceus with Toxic and phazes it with Whirlwind. Even after Stealth Rock damage, +2 Shadow Claw fails to KO Lugia.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde-C</strong>: A healthy Zygarde-C is not 2HKOed by Extreme Speed unless Arceus is fully set up. Coil variants take pathetic damage from even boosted Arceus. However, Zygarde-C is easily disposed of if Arceus opted for Ice Beam, and defensive variants without Coil find themselves being set up on by Arceus with Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Due to their high bulk and resistance to Extreme Speed, Steel-types such as Skarmory, Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela prove to be nuisances for Arceus to deal with. Skarmory even checks Arceus behind Substitute by phazing it with Whirlwind. Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn, although they have an extreme weakness to Fire Blast, can otherwise take on Arceus without much trouble. Celesteela is not even 2HKOed by Fire Blast but is set up on by Substitute variants of Arceus and eventually overwhelmed by excessive boosted Shadow Claw. Necrozma-DM can survive boosted Shadow Claw thanks to Prism Armor and hit back hard using Sunsteel Strike. Mega Lucario takes boosted Extreme Speed if healthy enough and OHKOes Arceus lacking Chople Berry using Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Although they struggle taking a boosted Extreme Speed, Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Blaziken are good offensive checks to Arceus due to them easily OHKOing it with Low Kick if it lacks Chople Berry. Buzzwole is bulky enough to take multiple boosted hits and can use Hammer Arm a few times or stall Arceus out with Toxic and Roost to cut Arceus's sweep short.</p> <p><strong>Mega Salamence: Mega Salamence easily survives even a boosted Extreme Speed thanks to its excellent bulk and Intimidate prior to Mega Evolution and can revenge kill weakened Arceus.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Arceus-Rock resists Extreme Speed and can survive a boosted Earthquake after burning Arceus with Will-O-Wisp. Tyranitar completely walls Arceus without Earthquake, and Choice Band variants can 2HKO in return.</p> <p><strong>Yveltal: Yveltal is bulky enough to take boosted Extreme Speed and OHKOes boosted Arceus with Foul Play after minimal prior damage. Defensive variants are not even close to falling into range of boosted Extreme Speed after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Psychic Terrain</strong>: Psychic Terrain from Tapu Lele prevents the use of Extreme Speed, and this is very detrimental to Arceus's sweep.</p> ",

In addition, many foes such as Zygarde-C, Giratina, and Celesteela are not strong enough to break Substitute with one hit, allowing Arceus to set up on them while avoiding the aforementioned status moves. Substitute also gives foes a much harder time revenge killing Arceus, especially for Marshadow.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Full investment in Attack with an Adamant nature maximizes Arceus's damage output and its ability to revenge kill weakened threats.</li> <li>16 Speed EVs allow Arceus to outpace neutral-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>The rest of the EVs are poured into HP to maximize Arceus's bulk and let it survive Yveltal's Foul Play from full health after a Swords Dance.</li> <li>Chople Berry allows Arceus to survive a Fighting-type attack from Marshadow and Mega Lucario, preventing them from easily revenge killing Arceus.</li> <li>Leftovers provides Arceus with passive recovery and lets it set up Substitute multiple times against passive foes.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Despite the fact that Arceus is best used late-game to clean up weakened teams, it can be utilized to KO faster threats, such as Geomancy Xerneas and Rock Polish Primal Groudon, if they have been weakened enough to be taken out by Extreme Speed.</li> <li>Thanks to good bulk and investment in HP, Arceus can be used as a blanket check to many threats, as it will mostly survive any unboosted hits.</li> <li>Avoid any form of status ailment, as it will significantly hinder Arceus's ability to clean up weakened teams late-game.</li> <li>Substitute sets can lure and take advantage of Arceus's common switch-ins such as Celesteela and both formes of Giratina by setting up multiple Swords Dances while avoiding status moves and Dragon Tail behind Substitute. Some Zygarde-C variants can also be set up on, as Thousand Arrows and Dragon Tail both fail to break Substitute in one hit.</li> <li>Sets with Chople Berry have a situational use of offensively checking unboosted Marshadow and Mega Lucario in an emergency, although the inability to set up on passive walls leaves Arceus with even fewer things to do. Bear in mind that weakened Arceus will still be KOed by appropriate moves from the aforementioned foes.</li> <li>Tapu Lele's Psychic Terrain prevents the use of Extreme Speed, so be wary of said foe switching into a predicted Extreme Speed and ensure it is eliminated for Arceus to successfully clean up late-game.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Arceus is usually employed on offensive teams that desire a solid revenge killer to take care of weakened setup sweepers and faster threats. It is best for one to consider pairing Arceus with teammates that can weaken or eliminate its checks, since Arceus will mostly depend on prior damage to defeat its foes with boosted attacks.</li> <li>Defensive Primal Groudon variants can set Stealth Rock for Arceus so it will meet many important benchmarks, while offensive variants do a better job weakening the opposing defensive cores and inflicting heavier damage on Geomancy Xerneas for Arceus to have better chance to pick it off afterwards. Primal Groudon also threatens Steel-types and defeats Marshadow, Mega Lucario, and Mega Gengar.</li> <li>Yveltal overwhelms Ghost-types and physically defensive walls with a strong Dark Pulse and shuts down passive walls with Taunt. Choice Scarf variants can take a more offensive approach to check Marshadow and Mega Gengar and bring Arceus in safely with U-turn.</li> <li>Mega Salamence excels at putting a dent on many walls like support Arceus formes, Primal Groudon, and Steel-types if it opts to use Earthquake and can switch into predicted Fighting-type attacks for Arceus. In return, Arceus can take advantage of certain physical walls that Mega Salamence doesn't have much of a way around otherwise, such as Celesteela and Zygarde-C.</li> <li>Mega Gengar has various options to aid Arceus in cleaning up late-game. Taunt variants can trap and remove problematic walls such as Lugia, Skarmory, and, depending on their typing, support Arceus formes. Hex variants can soften Steel-types with Will-O-Wisp and notably turn Ferrothorn and defensive Necrozma-DM into setup fodder for Arceus with Substitute. Lastly, Mega Gengar can use Destiny Bond to force a trade with the likes of defensive Yveltal, which would otherwise prove to be a serious problem for Arceus if left healthy.</li> <li>Xerneas is an offensive check to Marshadow, Yveltal, and Mega Salamence. Geomancy variants often carry a coverage move dedicated to hitting Steel-types or Primal Groudon, all of which Arceus struggles to defeat. Xerneas with Hidden Power Fire can potentially lure and either weaken or dispose of Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor early.</li> <li>Lastly, Marshadow offensively handles Mega Lucario, Tyranitar, and Steel-types. Life Orb variants are excellent ways to lure and remove Mega Salamence with Hidden Power Ice for Arceus, and they can potentially run Pursuit to eliminate Mega Gengar. Marshadow also tends to heavily pressure support Arceus formes and can switch into Fighting-type move for Arceus.</li> </ul> "

The Z-Crystal also allows Arceus to defeat Geomancy Xerneas in a one-on-one situation with a combination of Breakneck Blitz and Extreme Speed, preventing Arceus from being set up on.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Unlike a variant with Substitute, this set can more actively set up Swords Dance without worrying too much about chip damage and status moves, as Z-Refresh can fully restore Arceus and let it retaliate with boosted attacks afterwards.</li> <li>Arceus can also opt to preserve Normalium Z for the use of Breakneck Blitz against bulky foes that would otherwise survive a hit and retaliate; because Arceus cannot use both Breakneck Blitz and Z-Refresh, one must carefully consider what to use Normalium Z for.</li> <li>If there are foes that rely on status to check Arceus, such as defensive Necrozma-DM and Ho-Oh, support Arceus formes, and Hex variants of Giratina-O, and they cannot be sufficiently dealt with by Arceus's teammates before Arceus can set up for a sweep of its own, it is advised to take advantage of them by boosting Arceus multiple times, surprising them with Z-Refresh, and KOing them back.</li> <li>Against more offensive teams, where foes will rely on revenge killing to stop Arceus, it is advised to preserve the use of Normalium Z for Breakneck Blitz, as a foe will most likely send a threat that can survive only a boosted Extreme Speed. The Z-Move is also handy against Mega Salamence, which would otherwise require multiple boosts to take down with Extreme Speed, as +1 Breakneck Blitz OHKOes offensive variants.</li> <li>Breakneck Blitz is still powerful in its own right even when unboosted, and it notably gives Arceus an option to use a STAB move under Psychic Terrain. The Z-Move can be used to harshly punish threats like Xerneas that may try to take advantage of Arceus when they assume it can't do much back under Psychic Terrain.</li> <li>Refrain from setting up with Arceus when opposing Marshadow is still present, as this set is extremely vulnerable to it.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Checks to Marshadow are mandatory, as this set is easily revenge killed against it; Xerneas and Yveltal are offensive checks to Marshadow that benefit from Arceus taking advantage of passive Pokemon with Z-Refresh.</li> <li>Arceus also fails to do well against bulky foes such as Celesteela and Giratina that it can otherwise set up on with Substitute. Strong wallbreakers such as Yveltal and Rayquaza can weaken or eliminate them for Arceus. The former is especially helpful, since it can provide better setup opportunities for Arceus by shutting down a passive foe with Taunt or bringing in Arceus safely with U-turn.</li> <li>Mega Gengar is an alternative teammate that can handle passive foes, and most of the checks to Arceus, such as Celesteela, Lugia, and Skarmory, are vulnerable to trapping or can be KOed with Destiny Bond. In return, Arceus can remove threats such as Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Primal Groudon with boosted Breakneck Blitz and deal with faster threats that threaten Mega Gengar, such as Deoxys-A and Mewtwo.</li> <li>Stealth Rock support allows Arceus to meet various benchmarks on many threats at +2 and OHKO offensive Yveltal and Ho-Oh with +2 Extreme Speed to let it preserve the Z-Crystal for other foes. In offensive teams, Excadrill, Deoxys-S, and Cloyster are fantastic options for entry hazard setters.</li> <li>Primal Groudon can aid Arceus in various ways. It can set up Stealth Rock and even use Toxic on Lugia and Giratina-O, letting Arceus break through them more easily. Rock Polish variants can KO faster foes that can otherwise revenge kill Arceus. Swords Dance variants can significantly weaken or eliminate the likes of Zygarde-C, Celesteela, Giratina-O, and other physical walls.</li> <li>Ho-Oh threatens Steel-types and cripples physical attackers with burn from Sacred Fire, allowing Arceus to set up with ease. It is also a good check to Xerneas, a threat that Arceus cannot defeat in a one-on-one situation without using Breakneck Blitz.</li> <li>Mega Salamence pressures Steel-types and support Arceus formes well and can absorb status moves for Arceus to use boosted Facade.</li> <li>Other offensive powerhouses, such as Marshadow and Primal Kyogre, can fit alongside Arceus. The former checks Mega Lucario, which easily revenge kills Arceus, and benefits from Arceus taking advantage of support Arceus formes that Marshadow tends to draw in often.

It also renders Arceus-Bug vulnerable to being trapped by Mega Gengar due to its resistance to Judgment.</li> <li>A weakness to Stealth Rock badly compromises Arceus-Bug as a support Arceus forme, forcing it to lose 25% of its health every time it tries to take a hit for its team and almost requiring it to be run with Defog support.</li> <li>As a Stealth Rock user, Arceus-Bug is hard to justify given its terrible matchup against most of the tier's Defoggers, such as support Arceus formes, Xerneas, and especially Ho-Oh, all of which it cannot punish beyond Toxic.</li> <li>Arceus-Bug's competition as a bulky Stealth Rock setter, especially from Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Fairy, makes it drastically outclassed in most situations and hard to justify using on most serious teams.</li> <li>However, Arceus-Bug has its notable niche as a bulky Stealth Rock setter that can last throughout the match and will not be trapped by Gothitelle. In a metagame or specific game in which Gothitelle is the expected matchup, Arceus-Bug does become a valid option for archetypes that require a bulky Stealth Rock setter, giving it a tangible but very limited niche in the Ubers metagame.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Stone Edge can be run as a way to punish Ho-Oh, which is otherwise capable of easily switching into Arceus-Bug and OHKOing it.</li> <li>Earthquake can be used to prevent Mega Gengar from trapping Arceus-Bug without serious chip damage and is its best option to attack Mega Gengar even with a Timid nature. Earthquake also nets a nice 2HKO on Mega Lucario despite running a Timid nature. However, this attack is fairly useless against other targets.</li> <li>Fire Blast allows Arceus-Bug to hit Steel-types other than Necrozma-DM, notably including Mega Lucario, Magearna, Celesteela, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor.</li> <li>A physical sweeping set using Swords Dance and X-Scissor powered with Buginium Z can be run as an offensive check to Psychic- and Dark-types that is capable of surprising some of Arceus-Bug's usual counters with physical coverage. However, Arceus-Bug's terrible defensive typing limits its setup opportunities, and it becomes rather weak once its Z-Move is used, making this set generally ineffective in practice.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Arceus-Bug's most prominent checks are Flying-types, which hit it super effectively and are hard for Arceus-Bug's team to switch into. Ho-Oh and Mega Salamence easily force Arceus-Bug out by threatening to OHKO, and they often run Defog, which allows them to constantly switch into Arceus-Bug and remove entry hazards when it sets them up. Rayquaza threatens to OHKO Arceus-Bug with Dragon Ascent and can set up Dragon Dance with relative safety on Arceus-Bug. Less common Flying-types also have a good matchup: Shaymin-S can usually inflict enough flinches on Arceus-Bug to KO it with super effective Air Slash, while Arceus-Flying shrugs off Toxic with Refresh and sets up on Arceus-Bug.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon: Primal Groudon has nothing to fear from Arceus-Bug bar Toxic and can switch in to set up Stealth Rock or use devastating Fire-type attacks that Arceus-Bug's team is then forced to switch into.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Mega Gengar can switch into any of Arceus-Bug's moves bar the rare Earthquake and easily walls repeated uses of Judgment. While sets vary on whether they Taunt Arceus-Bug and 3HKO it while it cannot Recover, burn it and 2HKO with a powered-up Hex, or simply remove it with Perish Song or Destiny Bond, all common variants of Mega Gengar can dispose of Arceus-Bug.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: With the very notable exception of offensive Necrozma-DM, Steel-types can easily switch into any of Arceus-Bug's moves and threaten it in various ways. Defensive Necrozma-DM can set up Stealth Rock on Arceus-Bug and then Toxic stall it to death, healing the damage from Judgment with Morning Sun. Magearna fears nothing from Arceus-Bug, and while it cannot threaten it with any devastating moves, it can easily heal up on it using Pain Split or Volt Switch to a check that Arceus-Bug is then unable to Toxic on the switch. Mega Lucario can easily tank Arceus-Bug's Judgment and set up Swords Dance as it switches. Skarmory, Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor can set up Spikes, Defog, or Leech Seed while fearing nothing from Arceus-Bug other than the rare Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Xerneas</strong>: Xerneas fears nothing from Arceus-Bug except Toxic, allowing it to set up Geomancy, Defog hazards, or threaten it with powerful Moonblasts.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Coverage</strong>: Due to the popularity of Necrozma-DM, various Pokemon such as Mega Mewtwo Y and some support Arceus formes commonly carry Fire-type coverage that can hit Arceus-Bug super effectively.</p> <p><strong>Status Spreaders: Pokemon that run Toxic, notably including support Arceus formes, are able to force Arceus-Bug out by threatening it with debilitating status.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Stealth Rock damages enemy Pokemon when they switch in and provides Arceus-Bug with its niche as an entry hazard setter.</li> <li>Judgment is a reliable STAB move that will chip anything that doesn't resist it. It notably allows Arceus-Bug to break free of Gothitelle's trapping, 3HKO offensive Necrozma-DM and 2HKO offensive Yveltal sets, and break Substitute from Arceus-Ground and Zygarde-C so it can manage offensive sets with Toxic.</li> <li>Recover allows Arceus-Bug to stay healthy and set Stealth Rock throughout the match.</li> <li>Toxic is Arceus-Bug's only real punish option against the long list of Pokemon it cannot otherwise threaten, notably including Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, support Arceus formes, and Xerneas. It is especially notable as Arceus-Bug's main way of punishing Defog users.</li> <li>Ice Beam can be used to better check Zygarde-C and Rayquaza by threatening a 2HKO and OHKO, respectively, while also allowing Arceus-Bug to OHKO Mega Salamence on a predicted switch. It also slightly improves the matchup against Arceus-Ground.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>144 EVs in Special Attack allow Arceus-Bug to 2HKO Mega Sableye, stopping teams with Magic Bounce from keeping Stealth Rock off their field. The investment also enables Arceus-Bug to 2HKO offensive Necrozma-DM after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>96 EVs in Speed allow Arceus-Bug to outspeed up to base 100 Pokemon, notably including Yveltal, Xerneas, Zygarde, Necrozma, and Rayquaza, as well as uncommon attackers such as Palkia and Zekrom.</li> <li>The remaining bulk investment allows Arceus-Bug to stay healthy and set Stealth Rock up repeatedly throughout the match.</li> <li>Alternatively, full investment in Speed allows Arceus-Bug to better check targets such as Arceus-Ground and gives it a chance to set Stealth Rock even against base 120s that can KO it such as Mega Salamence.</li> <li>An EV spread of 248 HP / 160 Def / 96 Spe can be used to allow Arceus-Bug to avoid the 2HKO from Life Orb Marshadow's Rock Tomb, allowing it to serve as a more solid check, while still outspeeding vital Pokemon such as Yveltal, Zygarde, and Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Insect Plate is used to form Arceus-Bug and provide it with a reliable STAB option in Judgment.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Arceus-Bug should set Stealth Rock at the earliest free turn it can get, then focus on spreading status or using coverage moves to annoy the opponent.</li> <li>Play Arceus-Bug conservatively so long as the opponent has a Defogger still in play. Once the enemy Defogger is down, Arceus-Bug can be played more recklessly if needed.</li> <li>If you see Gengar on the opposing lineup, make setting Stealth Rock a priority before it can transform. Once Mega Gengar is in play, avoid sending out Arceus-Bug unless you plan to double-switch, the opposing Defogger is down, or Mega Gengar is chipped enough for Arceus-Bug to handle it.</li> <li>If you have a coverage or status move to punish threats to Arceus-Bug, try to hit them on the switch rather than staying in on them, as Arceus-Bug still lacks a way to debilitate or OHKO its checks.</li> <li>Avoid switching into Stealth Rock unless your Defogger has fainted, as its weakness to the hazard makes it easy for Arceus-Bug to be overwhelmed.</li> <li>Be careful to avoid status, especially poison, as Arceus-Bug is easily worn down with hazard and status damage.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Gothitelle is a very effective partner for Arceus-Bug, as its terrible matchup against all of the tier's Defoggers would otherwise make it unviable as a Stealth Rock user, while Gothitelle excels at trapping the tier's Defog users.</li> <li>Defensive Zygarde-C is an excellent partner for Arceus-Bug, as it can switch into both of Arceus-Bug's best counters in Mega Salamence and Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM can benefit from Arceus-Bug as a partner, as it frees up these typical Stealth Rock setters to run offensive sets.</li> <li>Giratina-O and Defog Mega Salamence are good partners because they can switch into the Fire-type attacks that Primal Groudon may aim at Arceus-Bug and provide Defog support for Arceus-Bug to manage its Stealth Rock weakness.</li> <li>A solid revenge killer such as Choice Scarf Xerneas or Life Orb Marshadow helps mitigate the extent to which Arceus-Bug is setup bait for dangerous sweepers.</li> <li>Arceus-Bug doesn't enjoy being poisoned, so a good Toxic absorber such as Magearna, Facade Mega Salamence, Ferrothorn, or Necrozma-DM makes a good partner.</li> <li>Tyranitar can cover many of Arceus-Bug's weaknesses, as it can switch into Fire- and Flying-type attacks and use Pursuit to trap Mega Gengar.</li> </ul> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>A Perish Trap set centered around Whirlpool + Perish Song allows Arceus-Dark to function as a good stallbreaker capable of trapping most defensive Pokemon; however, it is quite ineffective against more offensive teams.</li> <li>Fire Blast with an EV spread of 252 HP / 64 Def / 192 Spe and a Timid nature to outspeed Jolly Mega Lucario can be used to net surprise OHKOs on certain Steel-types such as Mega Lucario, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn while also heavily damaging other Steel-types such as Magearna and Celesteela on the switch.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Most Fairy-types, such as Xerneas, Arceus-Fairy, and Magearna, wall Arceus-Dark and KO it with their STAB moves. Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy have to be wary of Toxic, though, while Magearna completely shuts down Arceus-Dark and is only 3HKOed by Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Mega Lucario, Marshadow, Blaziken, and Pheromosa can easily take down Arceus-Dark with their STAB Fighting-type attacks. However, due to their frailty, they should avoid switching in on Judgment multiple times and watch out for variants carrying Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Certain Steel-types: Bulky Steel-types that aren't weak to Judgment, such as Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Mega Scizor, are immune to Toxic and can punish Arceus-Dark. However, they have to watch out for certain sets carrying Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Chansey</strong>: Blissey and Chansey can shrug off any attack from Arceus-Dark with ease, remove status with Heal Bell or Natural Cure, and cripple Arceus-Dark with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: Offensive Primal Kyogre sets dislike being hit by Toxic but threaten to OHKO Arceus-Dark with +1 Origin Pulse, while defensive variants can wear down Arceus-Dark with the combination of Scald and Toxic and remove status with Rest.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh, with its massive special bulk, easily takes a Judgment from Arceus-Dark and can retaliate with a powerful Sacred Fire or Brave Bird or simply poison it with Toxic. However, Ho-Oh heavily dislikes being hit by Toxic and is threatened to be 2HKOed by Judgment if it switches into Stealth Rock.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Judgment lets Arceus-Dark check Ghost- and Psychic-types by damaging them super effectively and deals solid damage to most Pokemon that do not resist it. Being able to break through both Mega Gengar and Gothitelle grants Arceus-Dark an edge over other support Arceus formes.</li> <li>Recover keeps Arceus-Dark healthy throughout the match.</li> <li>Ice Beam allows Arceus-Dark to check Yveltal, Zygarde-C, Mega Salamence, and Rayquaza. Unlike other potential checks, Arceus-Dark distinguishes itself with its ability to avoid being trapped and KOed by opposing Shadow Tag users.</li> <li>Toxic lets Arceus-Dark punish opposing support Arceus formes, Xerneas, Ho-Oh, and Yveltal while also limiting opposing setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Arceus-Ground. It also allows Arceus-Dark to stall out some threats such as physical Primal Kyogre and offensive Yveltal by repeatedly using Recover to rack up Toxic damage.</li> <li>Stealth Rock can be run if no other teammate can find room for it or to allow teammates such as Primal Groudon to opt for sweeping-oriented sets. Arceus-Dark makes for a decent setter, as it can easily find free turns to set Stealth Rock and threaten certain Defog users such as Giratina-O and Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Defog is an option in the last slot to remove entry hazards for teammates, but despite Arceus-Dark's ability to defeat trappers, which are commonly employed to remove Defog users, it has a poor matchup against most Stealth Rock setters.</li> <li>Will-O-Wisp instead of Toxic allows Arceus-Dark to cripple Steel-types, particularly Mega Lucario and Necrozma-DM, but Toxic is typically preferred for its greater utility against most targets, particularly Fairy-types, most bulky setup sweepers, and defensive foes.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>96 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Arceus-Dark to outspeed everything up to and including maximum Speed base 100s, most notably Yveltal, Lunala, and Rayquaza.</li> <li>252 HP EVs maximize Arceus-Dark's bulk.</li> <li>The remaining EVs are invested in Defense to help Arceus-Dark take strong physical attacks such as Necrozma-DM's Searing Sunraze Smash, Zygarde-C's +1 Tectonic Rage, and Mega Salamence's Double-Edge.</li> <li>144 EVs can be shifted from Defense to Special Attack if running Stealth Rock, guaranteeing a 2HKO with Judgment on physically defensive Mega Sableye. However, the lower physical bulk means that Arceus-Dark's matchup against threats such as Z-Move Necrozma-DM, Dragon Dance Mega Salamence, and Zygarde-C becomes shakier; the former two have a chance to OHKO Arceus-Dark after Stealth Rock with Searing Sunraze Smash and +1 Adamant Double-Edge, respectively.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Switch Arceus-Dark into threats that it checks, such as Lunala, Zygarde-C, and Mega Mewtwo Y.</li> <li>Use Recover liberally to keep Arceus-Dark healthy enough to take on these foes again.</li> <li>Be wary of opposing Fairy-types, as they can easily switch into Arceus-Dark and proceed to set up, use utility moves, or simply fire off super effective attacks. If necessary, try to limit their switch-in opportunities by setting up entry hazards, catching them with Toxic, or double switching to teammates such as Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM to take their momentum.</li> <li>Swords Dance Necrozma-DM and Outrage Ultra Necrozma can overwhelm Arceus-Dark, so attempt to scout Necrozma-DM's set before taking it on or rely on teammates such as Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh to discourage Necrozma-DM from setting up Swords Dance.</li> <li>Although Arceus-Dark can switch into most offensive Yveltal variants and win the duel, sets carrying Taunt or Toxic can be problematic for Arceus-Dark to face, especially when the moves are paired together. Taunt denies Arceus-Dark's usage of Recover, allowing Yveltal to either significantly weaken Arceus-Dark with constant Oblivion Wings or ensure that any residual damage, such as from Yveltal's own Toxic, lasts. Generally, Arceus-Dark prefers to switch into Yveltal on a resisted Dark-type move, which can be accomplished through pivoting in order to bait Yveltal into attacking teammates that are weak to its Dark-type moves.</li> <li>Yveltal carrying all three of Taunt, Toxic, and Roost can easily stall out Arceus-Dark with Toxic damage while healing off Ice Beams if it is not badly poisoned itself. If this is the case, attempt to inflict Yveltal with Toxic, either from a teammate or from Arceus-Dark. If Arceus-Dark is carrying Toxic, try to avoid Taunt in order to threaten Yveltal with Toxic. If it cannot, then aim to limit Yveltal's free switches in with Stealth Rock instead.</li> <li>Additionally, be wary of switching into Yveltal sets with U-turn, as continuous U-turns can wear down Arceus-Dark to the point where it is too weakened to take on threats it would usually check.</li> <li>If possible, scout Zygarde-C's set before recklessly switching Arceus-Dark in, as it does not enjoy taking a Glare from defensive variants without cleric support.</li> <li>Avoid recklessly using Judgment if Lucario is present on the opposing team, as Lucario can break through certain checks to it with the Attack boost from Justified. Similarly, Stealth Rock and Toxic must be used with caution against teams with Mega Sableye or Mega Diancie.</li> <li>Arceus-Dark can set Stealth Rock on free turns, but avoid over-committing to using Stealth Rock unless the opposing Defog user is knocked out or cannot deal with Arceus-Dark.</li> <li>Thanks to its high mixed bulk, a healthy Arceus-Dark can function as a backup check to weakened sweepers such as mixed Rock Polish Primal Groudon, but it will likely lose most of its health doing so.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Support Arceus-Dark fits best on balance and defensive teams looking for a reliable and trap-resistant check to Ghost-, Psychic-, and Dragon-types. Most Pokemon that can escape or overpower Shadow Tag users can be paired with Arceus-Dark to form a team with a defensive backbone that doesn't fear Gothitelle.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM and Magearna can both switch into Fairy-types for Arceus-Dark and appreciate it taking on Zygarde-C and opposing Necrozma. Necrozma-DM and Magearna also appreciate Arceus-Dark checking Fire Blast Mega Mewtwo Y, Lunala, and in Necrozma-DM's case, Yveltal.</li> <li>Primal Groudon checks Fairy-types, checks Primal Kyogre, and helps Arceus-Dark take on Necrozma-DM. In return, Arceus-Dark can use Ice Beam to take on Zygarde-C, Mega Salamence, Rayquaza, and Yveltal. Stealth Rock Arceus-Dark can also free up offensive Primal Groudon variants to focus on sweeping rather than setting the entry hazard.</li> <li>Mega Gengar can trap and dispose of unboosted Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy, removing what is likely the opponent's primary check to Arceus-Dark, and can also revenge kill Necrozma-DM variants that manage to break through Arceus-Dark. In return, Arceus-Dark can switch into Yveltal, Zygarde-C, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Deoxys-A.</li> <li>Ho-Oh can check Fairy types, Mega Lucario, and Marshadow without Rock Tomb and helps Arceus-Dark against threats such as Yveltal and Deoxys-A, being able to pivot into them and bait out a resisted attack that Arceus-Dark can switch into. Ho-Oh can also help defeat Necrozma-DM and appreciates Arceus-Dark being able to cover the possibility of Ultra Necrozma. With Ice Beam, Arceus-Dark also takes on Zygarde-C, Mega Salamence, and Rayquaza, all of which can threaten Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Toxapex can check Fairy- and Fighting-types, especially Marshadow and Mega Lucario, and use them as fodder to set up Toxic Spikes, which can punish further attempts they make to switch into Arceus-Dark. Toxapex benefits from Arceus-Dark checking Zygarde-C and Psychic-types, such as Deoxys-A and Mega Mewtwo Y.</li> <li>Blissey and Chansey can take on Xerneas, support Arceus formes carrying Toxic, and specially oriented Primal Kyogre and provide cleric support with Heal Bell. They value Arceus-Dark's ability to take on Mega Mewtwo Y, Yveltal carrying Taunt or Knock Off, and Lunala carrying Psyshock and its capacity to check various threatening physical attackers such as Necrozma-DM and Ultra Necrozma.</li> <li>Choice Scarf Xerneas can provide cleric support with Aromatherapy and check Marshadow and Outrage Ultra Necrozma for Arceus-Dark, while Arceus-Dark checks Necrozma-DM and Mega Gengar and alleviates pressure from Xerneas in taking on Yveltal, Zygarde-C, and Rayquaza.</li> <li>Both Giratina formes can switch into Primal Groudon to remove hazards with Defog and value Arceus-Dark's ability to take on Yveltal and Ghost-types other than Marshadow.</li> <li>Lugia can blanket check setup sweepers that can break through Arceus-Dark, such as Swords Dance Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Outrage Ultra Necrozma, while Arceus-Dark deals with Yveltal, Ghost-types, and Necrozma-DM. Lugia can drop Ice Beam because Arceus-Dark carries the move, allowing Lugia to free up a moveslot to take on other threats.</li> <li>Mega Sableye shuts down most passive walls that Arceus-Dark struggles with, thanks to Magic Bounce reflecting status moves such as Toxic, Leech Seed, and hazards. If running a physically defensive EV spread, Mega Sableye also checks most Fighting-types, most notably Life Orb Marshadow.</li> </ul> "

With a bit of Special Attack investment and chip damage from Stealth Rock, Devastating Drake followed by Draco Meteor can 2HKO Gothitelle switching in, while Spacial Rend's higher critical hit chance can help disrupt a trapping attempt.</li> <li>A physically offensive set of Swords Dance / Outrage / Earthquake / Iron Tail with Dragonium Z is outclassed by Arceus and Arceus-Ground; Arceus-Ground has better two-move coverage, letting it run options like Substitute to defeat Celesteela and protect it from status, while Extreme Killer Arceus has STAB Extreme Speed and can hold other items, allowing it to bypass many typical checks, such as Chople Berry for Marshadow.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Xerneas, Arceus-Fairy, Magearna, and Mega Diancie are immune to Judgment, aren't threatened by Will-O-Wisp or Fire Blast with the exception of Magearna for the latter, and threaten Arceus-Dragon with their super effective STAB attacks. They can set up Stealth Rock, set up stat boosts, or remove status from their team in the turn they force Arceus-Dragon out.</p> <p><strong>Gothitelle: Gothitelle traps and easily removes Arceus-Dragon from play by PP stalling or setting up Calm Mind, only fearing a chain of critical hits. Without a Pursuit user as a teammate, Arceus-Dragon can't stay in for a single turn if it doesn't want to get trapped, provided it manages to safely switch in at all due to the threat of a double switch into Gothitelle.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh's typing, bulk and Regenerator let it take anything Arceus-Dragon typically carries and cripple it in return with Toxic before firing off powerful Brave Birds.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: Primal Kyogre hits Arceus-Dragon super effectively with Ice Beam or cripples it with Toxic while tanking Judgment and not caring about any Fire-type moves Arceus-Dragon carries. However, Arceus-Dragon can use its resistances to Water and Electric to switch into Primal Kyogre before pivoting out to a more appropriate check.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey</strong>: Both Chansey and Blissey fear nothing from special sets of Arceus-Dragon and inflict status or support their team in return.</p> <p><strong>Necrozma-DM</strong>: Specially defensive sets of Necrozma-DM easily stall out Fire Blast while retaliating with Toxic and Stealth Rock. Due to Toxic damage, Arceus-Dragon cannot stay in and use Defog to remove Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage</strong>: Dragon-type moves on Rayquaza, Zygarde-C, and Mega Salamence can heavily damage or OHKO Arceus-Dragon. Dragon Tail on Primal Groudon messes with Arceus-Dragon by forcing it out while dealing considerable damage, while Dragon Pulse can 2HKO.</p> <p><strong>Status: Toxic cuts into Arceus-Dragon's longevity, which means it can't stay in for too long even against threats it would check otherwise like Stealth Rock Primal Groudon, and may force it to use Recover defensively when it would rather use Defog or act proactively.

It deals a solid chunk of damage to Primal Groudon, 2HKOing or 3HKOing offensive variants, and OHKOes most Mega Salamence, Rayquaza, and offensive Zygarde-C.</li> <li>Will-O-Wisp cripples non-Fire-type physical attackers, notably allowing it to check offensive Necrozma-DM and Mega Lucario. It also chips at defensive Steel- and Fairy-types, which take Judgment with ease.</li> <li>Fire Blast deals upwards of 70% to Ferrothorn, can OHKO Mega Lucario, and allows Arceus-Dragon to stand up to most other Steel-types in the tier. However, it cannot 2HKO offensive variants of Necrozma-DM, and specially defensive variants easily stall out Fire Blast.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Draco Plate grants Arceus-Dragon its typing and turns Judgment into a Dragon-type move.</li> <li>24 Special Defense EVs let Arceus-Dragon survive two full-powered Eruptions from Primal Groudon, which can be helpful if the former's Speed has been lowered by Sticky Web or paralysis.</li> <li>192 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Arceus-Dragon to outspeed Mega Lucario so it can cripple it with a burn or KO it with Fire Blast before it can attack. Arceus-Dragon also outspeeds Adamant Mega Salamence and all unboosted variants of Primal Groudon, Rayquaza, and Yveltal.</li> <li>Maximum HP investment grants the most bulk, allowing Arceus-Dragon to take on as many offensive threats as possible.</li> <li>The rest of the EVs are placed in Defense to take physical attacks better.</li> <li>Maximum Speed investment is a possible option that allows Arceus-Dragon to at worst Speed tie with other Arceus formes and maximum Speed Mega Salamence, giving it a chance to burn Swords Dance Arceus before it can attack as well as KO Jolly Mega Salamence before it can 2HKO with Double-Edge.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Switch Arceus-Dragon into the Pokemon it checks, such as Primal Groudon and Mega Salamence, to either Defog their entry hazards, force them to switch out, or damage them as they attempt to attack or set up further.</li> <li>Use Defog when you want to remove entry hazards and won't be heavily punished for using the turn to do so. Defog may not be best option if the opponent has a Stealth Rock setter that can switch back in on Arceus-Dragon to set it again. Defog should not be used if Stealth Rock is up on both sides and the benefits of keeping Stealth Rock up on your opponent's side outweighs the benefits of removing Stealth Rock from your own.</li> <li>Use Recover throughout the match to stay healthy enough to check what it needs to check.</li> <li>Use Judgment to damage the Pokemon it checks or simply if there is nothing better to do.</li> <li>Use Will-O-Wisp to cripple physical attackers that aren't Fire-type.</li> <li>Attack Steel-types with Fire Blast, but be wary that Ferrothorn can scout for Fire Blast with Protect. Note that Fire Blast often will not be sufficient to stop offensive Necrozma-DM from setting up by itself and will hardly threaten specially defensive variants.</li> <li>Be wary of letting Arceus-Dragon be afflicted by Toxic, as this will greatly cut into its longevity and Arceus-Dragon cannot use Toxic on foes in return. Allowing Arceus-Dragon to take a Toxic becomes a much easier decision if it has a cleric on its team.</li> <li>If preserving Arceus-Dragon is necessary to check threats on your opponent's team or for using Defog later in the match, switch it out into an appropriate teammate when faced with an opposing Pokemon it can't threaten.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Checks to Fairy-types are absolutely required. Examples include Steel-, Fire-, and Poison-types such as Necrozma-DM, Primal Groudon, and Mega Gengar. Mega Gengar can also use Hex to take advantage of Arceus-Dragon spreading burns.</li> <li>As Ho-Oh fears nothing from this set, checks and switch-ins to Ho-Oh such as Primal Kyogre, Tyranitar, and Mega Diancie or lures such as Stone Edge Necrozma-DM are necessary with Arceus-Dragon. Strong Stealth Rock setters and anti-Defog support such as Primal Groudon and Gothitelle, respectively, also help immensely against Ho-Oh. Gothitelle can also aid Arceus-Dragon against opposing support Pokemon such as Arceus formes and defensive Steel-types if Arceus Dragon lacks Fire Blast.</li> <li>Pursuit support from Marshadow, Tyranitar, and Alolan Muk greatly helps against Gothitelle.</li> <li>Clerics such as Aromatherapy Xerneas and Heal Bell Magearna and Toxic absorbers such as RestTalk Primal Kyogre, Steel-types, and Poison-types are heavily appreciated, as Arceus-Dragon is vulnerable to status.</li> <li>Switch-ins to Dragon- and Ice-type moves such as Steel-, Fairy-, and Water-types are also good teammates.</li> <li>Pokemon such as Primal Kyogre that have trouble against Ferrothorn heavily appreciate Arceus-Dragon luring it with Fire Blast.</li> <li>Similarly, Arceus-Dragon makes a great teammate to Pokemon that are weak to Stealth Rock or threats that Arceus-Dragon checks. Such teammates include Ho-Oh, Xerneas, and Ferrothorn.</li> <li>Physical wallbreakers such as Bulk Up Marshadow, Swords Dance Primal Groudon, and Ultra Necrozma can break through walls and specially bulky tanks that Arceus-Dragon cannot threaten.</li> <li>A secondary Defogger such as Defog Ho-Oh can help versus Stealth Rock setters that Arceus-Dragon struggles with, such as Toxic Primal Groudon, specially defensive Necrozma-DM, and Arceus-Fairy.</li> </ul> "

  "Arceus-Electric": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Arceus-Electric's typing makes it a unique choice as an Arceus forme, letting it provide teams with an essential check to common Flying-types in the tier such as Mega Salamence and Arceus-Flying.</li> <li>It is the only Calm Mind Arceus forme other than Arceus-Rock that is able to break past Ho-Oh effectively, and it is also capable of dealing with Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>Good overall bulk means Arceus-Electric is able take on threats such as Mega Lucario and Primal Kyogre after a Calm Mind boost, threats that other Calm Mind Arceus formes such as Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Rock can't check defensively.</li> <li>However, Arceus-Electric is susceptible to common Ground-types such as Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground, which are able to exploit it easily. Pokemon that it is usually designated to check such as Rayquaza, Mega Salamence, and Ho-Oh also carry Ground-type coverage, which can give it issues.</li> <li>Arceus-Electric has to compete with Calm Mind Arceus formes that are able to utilize a mono-attacking set with Refresh such as Arceus-Flying and Arceus-Dark, which have a superior typing and are able to hit Ground-types with Judgment. Arceus-Electric is also forced to run coverage, as otherwise it is completely stopped by Ground-types.</li> <li>Arceus-Electric is very team specific for the small positives it provides. It is advised to use other Calm Mind Arceus formes over it due to how they outclass it.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Electrium Z is interesting to consider for a powerful one-time Gigavolt Havoc, but it uses up the Z-Crystal slot and means Arceus-Electric has to drop Judgment for Thunderbolt, so there is a noticeable power difference after Gigavolt Havoc is used. While utilizing Electrium Z, one can also opt for Thunder over Thunderbolt for increased damage output, but the loss of accuracy and lower PP can be a downside.</li> <li>Forgoing Recover for Earth Power and running maximum Special Attack investment instead of HP investment can be considered, though this severely limits Arceus-Electric's durability and makes it worse at checking its notable targets, makes switching in very difficult and, leaves Arceus-Electric without reliable recovery. Earth Power allows it to hit Primal Groudon for reasonable damage but doesn't do much else.</li> <li>Toxic can be used over Calm Mind, as Arceus-Electric invites common Ground-type answers such as Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground that dislike being statused by Toxic, though this removes Arceus-Electric's ability to break through teams late-game.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types:</strong> Ground-types are immune to Judgment, and Ice Beam is weak without boosts to do any notable damage to them. Primal Groudon is hit neutrally by Ice Beam, allowing it to use Arceus-Electric as fodder to get Stealth Rock up or use setup moves such as Rock Polish and Swords Dance. Swords Dance Arceus-Ground is able to set up and OHKO Arceus-Electric with Tectonic Rage, but defensive variants lacking Toxic are unable to deal with Arceus-Electric effectively, as it is able to set up Calm Minds and Arceus-Ground does insufficient damage with Judgment and becomes setup fodder. Lead Excadrill is comfortably able to get up Stealth Rock, as Ice Beam does not 2HKO and is still a roll with boosts. Excadrill is also able to get a Toxic off or simply use Earthquake, which nets a 2HKO on Arceus-Electric. Zygarde-C variants such as Dragon Dance are able to OHKO with Tectonic Rage or simply 2HKO with Thousand Arrows, though it has to be wary of Ice Beam if not behind a Substitute or if its Z-Crystal has been consumed.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Chansey: Blissey and Chansey completely wall Arceus-Electric, taking pathetic damage from Judgment, removing boosts with Confide, and stalling it out with Toxic and Soft-Boiled.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn</strong>: Ferrothorn resists Judgment and takes little damage from Ice Beam, sets up Spikes, and annoys Arceus-Electric with Leech Seed.</p> <p><strong>Magearna</strong>: Magearna is able to take a Judgment easily and render Calm Mind boosts useless by taking Arceus-Electric's boosts with Heart Swap and forcing it out. Magearna is also able to heal off any damage dealt by using Pain Split.</p> <p><strong>Necrozma-DM</strong>: Necrozma-DM is able to use Arceus-Electric as setup fodder or 2HKO it with Earthquake, as Judgment fails to net a 2HKO on a healthy Necrozma-DM. Specially defensive variants are able to cripple Arceus-Electric with Toxic and use Morning Sun to heal any damage.</p> <p><strong>Ultra Necrozma</strong>: Ultra Necrozma is able 2HKO Arceus-Electric with Earthquake or set up on it with Swords Dance, but it has to be wary of Ice Beam if it's considerably weakened, as Ice Beam will score a 2HKO.</p> <p><strong>Trappers</strong>: Mega Gengar has access to Destiny Bond + Taunt, which allows it to force a trade with Arceus-Electric, but is unable to switch into a Judgment. Gothitelle is able to PP stall Arceus-Electric with the combination of Confide, Taunt, and Rest until it is forced to use Struggle.</p> ",

Be wary of hard switching Arceus-Electric into Pokemon it can usually check but commonly carry Toxic, such as defensive Ho-Oh, Lugia, Arceus-Water, and defensive Yveltal, as it is unable to run Refresh, so switching Arceus-Electric in makes it very vulnerable and can be risky.</li> <li>It is best to switch Arceus-Electric into attacks from Choice-locked Pokemon such as Oblivion Wing from Yveltal and Brave Bird from Ho-Oh, providing it with a free turn to set up, attack, or recover off damage. If possible avoid switching into Life Orb Yveltal and Rayquaza, as they can deal a considerable amount of damage with Dark Pulse and Draco Meteor. Naturally hard-hitting Pokemon such as Mega Lucario and Primal Kyogre can also do massive damage to Arceus-Electric, meaning that switching into them can lead to momentum loss, as Arceus-Electric is forced to recover off the damage.</li> <li>Pokemon that Arceus-Electric is commonly an answer to such as Mega Salamence, Ho-Oh, and Rayquaza can sometimes be carrying Earthquake as a coverage move, and it is advised to scout for these moves; if they do carry these moves, Arceus-Electric's ability to check them formidably is limited.</li> <li>Calm Mind is best set up late-game, as Arceus-Electric can be played more recklessly and break through the opposing team when all notable answers such as Primal Groudon, Blissey, Chansey, Ferrothorn, and Arceus-Ground have been removed or extremely weakened; otherwise, these Pokemon can easily exploit Arceus-Electric or use it as setup fodder.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Giratina-O is an essential teammate for Arceus-Electric. It provides a strong answer to Ground-types such as Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground due to its Ground immunity and removes entry hazards such as Toxic Spikes, which threatens Arceus-Electric because it is unable to use Refresh, with Defog. In return, Arceus-Electric helps against Yveltal, which threatens Giratina-O, and physical attackers such as Ho-Oh and Mega Salamence, which Giratina-O is unable to deal with effectively due to its lack of recovery.</li> <li>Primal Groudon is able to provide Stealth Rock support to help Arceus-Electric deal with Ho-Oh and Mega Salamence and break Multiscale on Lugia. Primal Groudon sets with Fire moves such as Overheat also help deal with Ferrothorn and Necrozma-DM and considerably weaken Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>Zygarde-C is able to provide a check to most Primal Groudon variants and help out against Swords Dance Arceus-Ground lacking Substitute, Mega Lucario, and Marshadow lacking Hidden Power Ice.</li> <li>Primal Kyogre has good offensive synergy with Arceus-Electric. Mixed attacker sets are able to deal with defensively oriented teams, break down Pokemon that commonly wall Arceus-Electric such as Blissey and Chansey, and provide a soft check to Primal Groudon if required. In return, Primal Kyogre appreciates Arceus-Electric's ability to deal with Pokemon that threaten Primal Kyogre such as Mega Salamence, Rayquaza, and Mega Lucario.</li> <li>Xerneas and Magearna are able to provide cleric support with Aromatherapy and Heal Bell, relieving Arceus-Electric of status. Choice Scarf Xerneas is a particularly good fit due to its ability to deal with offensive teams and also provide Defog support if necessary. In return, Arceus-Electric deals with Ho-Oh and Mega Lucario, which threaten both Magearna and Xerneas. Chansey and Blissey can also fill a similar role of a cleric and help out further against Geomancy Xerneas and Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>Mega Lucario is able to break common answers to Arceus-Electric such as Ferrothorn, Blissey, and Chansey, improving its team's matchup against defensive teams.</li> <li>Yveltal is able to deal with Mega Gengar, which could force a trade with Arceus-Electric by using Destiny Bond in conjunction with Taunt. Yveltal also deals with against Marshadow and provides a reliable Ground immunity to the team.</li> <li>Mega Salamence is immune to Ground, provides an answer to Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground, and can be an additional sweeper with Dragon Dance.</li> <li>Though it provides no synergy with Arceus-Electric at all, Dugtrio is able to trap and OHKO Primal Groudon, letting Arceus-Electric's ability break the opposing team more easily.</li> </ul> "

  "Arceus-Fairy": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Blessed by an excellent typing offensively and defensively with solid bulk and access to reliable recovery, Arceus-Fairy is perhaps the tier's best switch-in to the prominent Yveltal and Marshadow and can blanket check Dragon-type attackers such as Mega Salamence, Rayquaza, and Zygarde-C, letting it fit on a wide variety of teams.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy's solid bulk and its favorable matchup against Defog and Magic Bounce users such as Yveltal, Giratina-O, and Mega Sableye make it an excellent setter of Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Its strong neutral coverage with Judgment and Earth Power makes Arceus-Fairy a solid Calm Mind sweeper. It particularly stands out among sweepers because it does not need to be preserved for its sweep due to its bulk and recovery, allowing it to take hits to support the team early-game without losing momentum or sacrificing its potential for a sweep late-game.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy's support options and wide coverage including Will-O-Wisp to cripple Necrozma-DM, Toxic to handle support Arceus formes, Fire Blast to surprise Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, and Earth Power to chip away at Primal Groudon allow Arceus-Fairy to cover many of its weaknesses, although this also means that its limited moveslots will always leave it helpless against some of these Pokemon.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy is hard-countered by Necrozma-DM and has a relatively poor matchup against Primal Groudon, which lets the opponent set Stealth Rock or set up with powerful sweepers for free if it is used carelessly.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy fears poison and paralysis, which badly compromise its ability to keep Stealth Rock up, sponge attacks, or sweep when put on a timer or slowed and at risk of missing recovery turns. This typically forces it out against most passive Pokemon that it cannot hit super effectively and makes it hesitant to switch into Pokemon it can otherwise check, such as Taunt + Toxic Yveltal and Glare Zygarde-C.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy is easily trapped and disposed of by both Mega Gengar and Gothitelle, undermining its usefulness as a blanket check and entry hazard setter.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Calm Mind can be run on the Stealth Rock set less as a sweeping tool and more as a way to avoid being taken out by Gothitelle, but Necrozma-DM is a far more common threat.</li> <li>Stone Edge can be run to lure and KO Ho-Oh, which switches into Arceus-Fairy freely otherwise, but this similarly is hard to justify over Will-O-Wisp for Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Roar can be run on Arceus-Fairy to phaze setup sweepers and break out of Gothitelle's trapping. However, Arceus-Fairy without Earth Power or a status-inducing move has no way to meaningfully punish Steel-types or Primal Groudon, making it impractically passive for its usual bulky offense builds.</li> <li>Defog may seem a viable option on the Stealth Rock set, but Arceus-Fairy has a terrible matchup against most of the tier's entry hazard setters such as Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Primal Groudon, so the opponent can easily set hazards back up in its face.</li> <li>Refresh could be run on the Calm Mind set instead of Earth Power to heal off status and set up on Toxic spreaders, but Arceus-Fairy will completely lose its ability to stand up to Steel-types, Mega Gengar, Toxapex, and Primal Groudon.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Trappers</strong>: Stealth Rock Arceus-Fairy is very easily switched into, trapped, and disposed of by Gothitelle and Mega Gengar. Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy can stand up to Gothitelle but still loses to Mega Gengar one-on-one unless it has set up a boost or Mega Gengar has taken prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Necrozma-DM</strong>: Necrozma-DM is the second-best Pokemon in the tier and a hard-counter to Arceus-Fairy; Necrozma-DM 2HKOes Arceus-Fairy with Sunsteel Strike regardless of either Pokemon's set and can take advantage of Arceus-Fairy as it switches out to set up Stealth Rock, spread status, or set up offensive boosts and threaten a sweep. If Arceus-Fairy is not running Will-O-Wisp, it struggles to punish Necrozma-DM meaningfully, and even burned Necrozma-DM checks Arceus-Fairy confidently.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: While Stealth Rock Arceus-Fairy can annoy Primal Groudon with Toxic and Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy can do meaningful chip damage with Earth Power, Primal Groudon's attacks hit for more than Arceus-Fairy can heal and overwhelm it, and Primal Groudon can usually set up boosts fairly comfortably against Arceus-Fairy, making it a good check.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Although it dislikes being hit by Toxic, Ho-Oh can generally switch into Arceus-Fairy confidently. Defensive sets carry Toxic, and trading Toxic usually puts the Ho-Oh user at an advantage, while the Choice Band set hits for more than Arceus-Fairy can heal and pushes the Arceus-Fairy user to switch into a strong attack.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor have nothing to fear from Arceus-Fairy bar the rare Fire Blast and can freely switch in to set entry hazards and spread status, respectively. Magearna can steal boosts from Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy with Heart Swap and use Stealth Rock Arceus-Fairy to heal with Pain Split without fear. Celesteela can set up Leech Seed and threaten Arceus-Fairy with Heavy Slam, outlasting it easily bar the rare Calm Mind + Fire Blast set. Aegislash 2HKOes Arceus-Fairy with Gyro Ball and is at worst inconvenienced by Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre: Offensive Primal Kyogre sets hit Arceus-Fairy for much more than it can heal and do not really fear switching in, while defensive Primal Kyogre sets can endlessly take Arceus-Fairy's attacks and status moves and can heal with Rest. Primal Kyogre defeats Arceus-Fairy in a Calm Mind war.</p> <p><strong>Status Spreaders</strong>: Being hit by Toxic will put Arceus-Fairy on a timer, preventing it from keeping up Stealth Rock or setting up for a sweep. Similarly, paralysis will take away its Speed and also threaten to make Arceus-Fairy overwhelmed by the attacks it is supposed to switch into if it misses Recover turns. Because of this, Arceus-Fairy is usually forced out by status spreaders such as support Arceus formes, and it is even hesitant to switch into some of its usual targets, such as Yveltal and Zygarde-C, if they could potentially spread status onto it.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Though rare, Toxapex will completely wall Arceus-Fairy's attacks, hazing away boosts accumulated by Calm Mind sets and taking advantage of free turns to set Toxic Spikes. Naganadel will also threaten Arceus-Fairy by outspeeding it and hitting it with devastating super effective STAB Poison-type attacks.</p> ",

Even though Arceus-Fairy runs this move, it should still be avoiding Steel-types unless they have serious prior damage.</li> <li>Do not allow Arceus-Fairy to get hit by Toxic or paralysis, which will make it unable to sweep. Getting hit by Will-O-Wisp intentionally is a good way to prevent these statuses if possible.</li> <li>Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy can break out of Gothitelle's trapping but should be wary of Mega Gengar, which will beat it one-on-one unless it has a boost, and even with that boost, Arceus-Fairy is typically left within range of being revenge killed.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy fits well on Sticky Web teams, as it can confidently handle the Defoggers that are immune to the entry hazard such as Giratina-O, Mega Salamence, and Yveltal, allowing it to keep Sticky Web up while also being a threatening sweeper.</li> <li>Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy is a good Pokemon to add to a bulky offense or balance team that needs a switch-in for Dark-, Dragon-, and Fighting-type attacks that will not lose much momentum. Pokemon found on said team archetypes that fear these attacks, such as Zygarde-C, Giratina-O, Mega Salamence, and Necrozma-DM, benefit from being teamed up with Arceus-Fairy. Zygarde-C and Mega Salamence stand out for their ability to also switch into Arceus-Fairy's checks, such as Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Trappers can be used to clear the way for Arceus-Fairy to sweep. Mega Gengar can be used to dispose of defensive stops to Arceus-Fairy such as Magearna, Chansey, and Necrozma-DM with Destiny Bond. Gothitelle can trap defensive variants of Necrozma-DM, which could otherwise endlessly switch into Arceus-Fairy, and support Arceus formes that can interrupt a sweep with Toxic. Both Mega Gengar and Gothitelle can also handle the likes of Blissey and Toxapex if they lack Shed Shell.</li> <li>Primal Groudon breaks through Steel- and Poison-types with powerful super effective STAB moves and can set up Stealth Rock to help Arceus-Fairy to sweep.</li> <li>Wallbreakers such as Primal Kyogre, Rayquaza, and Life Orb Yveltal put pressure on defensive Arceus formes, which can switch into Arceus-Fairy and interrupt a sweep with Toxic if left healthy. These wallbreakers also handle Primal Groudon effectively, which needs to be chipped at significantly for Arceus-Fairy to handle it with a +1 Earth Power.</li> <li>As a bulky setup sweeper, Arceus-Fairy appreciates entry hazard support, such as Spikes from Ferrothorn and Stealth Rock from Necrozma-DM and Primal Groudon. Ferrothorn stands out as a partner for its ability to absorb Toxic for Arceus-Fairy.</li> </ul> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Judgment is a reliable Fairy-type STAB move that does significant damage on Pokemon that don't resist it and allows Arceus-Fairy to OHKO the Pokemon it is supposed to check, such as Marshadow, Yveltal, and Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Stealth Rock damages foes when they switch in and is almost mandatory in any serious team. Arceus-Fairy's typing and bulk give it a strong matchup against most Defoggers and allow it to keep Stealth Rock up throughout the match.</li> <li>Recover keeps Arceus-Fairy healthy to check Dark- and Dragon-types and allows it to set up Stealth Rock several times throughout the match.</li> <li>Will-O-Wisp provides Arceus-Fairy with an option to punish Necrozma-DM, a hard-counter to Arceus-Fairy that is also the second-most prominent Pokemon in the metagame. Will-O-Wisp can also be used to debilitate other physical attackers in a pinch.</li> <li>Toxic is an alternative status move that allows Arceus-Fairy to have a way of hurting passive Pokemon such as support Arceus formes, which can switch into it without fear otherwise, but running Toxic leaves Necrozma-DM free to switch into Arceus-Fairy repeatedly.</li> <li>Fire Blast can be run as an alternative to status moves, allowing Arceus-Fairy to severely damage Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, which otherwise switch into this set with impunity and respectively set Spikes or use Defog. It also provides Arceus-Fairy with a way to chip at Necrozma-DM, Magearna, and Celesteela.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Full investment in HP increases Arceus-Fairy's bulk, allowing it to set up entry hazards reliably throughout the match.</li> <li>Maximum Speed investment allows Arceus-Fairy to at worst Speed tie with Mega Salamence as well as Arceus formes.</li> <li>An alternative EV spread with 96 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allows Arceus-Fairy to outspeed Pokemon up to positive-natured base 100s, which notably includes Xerneas, Yveltal, Rayquaza, and Palkia, solidly checking all except Xerneas. This allows Arceus-Fairy to invest more in its defenses while still outspeeding its crucial targets.</li> <li>192 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Arceus-Fairy to outspeed Mega Lucario and KO it after some chip damage, although Arceus-Fairy must be wary of Bullet Punch. It also outspeeds most variants of Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Pixie Plate is needed in order to use Arceus-Fairy and provides it with a steady boost in Judgment's power.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Arceus-Fairy should be liberally switched into Dragon-, Dark-, and Fighting-type Pokemon such as Mega Salamence, Giratina-O, Arceus-Dark, Yveltal, and Marshadow, forcing them out and thus gaining opportunities to set Stealth Rock or spread status.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy is capable of breaking through Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie with Judgment and fears little from their attacks, so it should be capable of getting Stealth Rock up against Magic Bounce users.</li> <li>Play Arceus-Fairy conservatively outside of these favorable matchups, especially while the opponent still has a Defogger in play. Be careful not to get overloaded, as a combination of resisted hits, status damage, and entry hazard damage can cause Arceus-Fairy to fall easily if used to sponge too much damage.</li> <li>The first priority when given a free turn should be to set up Stealth Rock. After that, Arceus-Fairy should try to spread Will-O-Wisp if expecting a Steel-type switch-in or Toxic if expecting a defensive switch-in, or it could consider double switching if not carrying the appropriate move.</li> <li>If the opponent is running Gothitelle or an already Mega-Evolved Gengar, leaving Arceus-Fairy out should be thought of as sacrificing it. This should definitely never be done if the opponent still has a healthy Defogger, or if the scenario can be avoided in general.</li> <li>Avoid being hit with Toxic and Glare when using Arceus-Fairy, as these significantly limit its usefulness as a defensive Pokemon and Stealth Rock setter. On the other hand, being burned does not really annoy Arceus-Fairy much and could even be beneficial, as it prevents Arceus-Fairy from being afflicted by a more annoying status, so switch into Will-O-Wisp if given the opportunity.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Stealth Rock Arceus-Fairy gives Necrozma-DM and Primal Groudon the freedom to run offensive sets, and they fit well on bulkier offense and balance teams that do not want to rely on suicide setters, so Arceus-Fairy should be considered on such teams if Necrozma-DM and Primal Groudon wish to run sweeping sets.</li> <li>Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM, Zygarde-C, Mega Salamence, Marshadow, Primal Groudon, and Giratina-O appreciate Arceus-Fairy's ability to switch into Dark-, Ghost-, and Dragon-type attacks. Defensive Zygarde-C in particular makes for a good teammate for its ability to switch into hits from Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Necrozma-DM, making a good defensive backbone.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy should be paired with a Defogger such as Giratina-O, Mega Salamence, or Yveltal. These Pokemon are also useful as checks to Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Gothitelle makes an excellent core with Arceus-Fairy. Gothitelle traps and disposes of passive Pokemon, notably including support Arceus formes and other Toxic spreaders users Arceus-Fairy cannot handle. This enables Arceus-Fairy to confidently run Will-O-Wisp, which in turn allows Gothitelle to switch into burned Necrozma-DM's attacks to trap it. Arceus-Fairy and Gothitelle together check all of the tier's Defoggers, which combined with Arceus-Fairy's ability to repeatedly set up Stealth Rock allows the team to maintain complete control over the flow of entry hazards mid- and late-game. To a lesser extent but with a Pokemon far easier to fit into teams, these advantages are also present with Mega Gengar.</li> <li>Pokemon that can threaten Steel-types for Arceus-Fairy, such as Yveltal, Primal Groudon, and Marshadow, make good partners.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy hates being poisoned or paralyzed, so it appreciates being partnered with a status absorber such as Zygarde-C, Facade Mega Salamence, Magearna, Ferrothorn, or Necrozma-DM or a cleric such as Heal Bell Magearna.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy is a common option when trying to patch up a weakness to Dark-types in teambuilding, so teams with Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM, Marshadow, Lunala, Giratina-O, and others that aren't already partnered with a good switch-in to Dark-types should consider Arceus-Fairy.</li> </ul> "

  "Arceus-Fighting": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Arceus-Fighting is one of the unviable Arceus formes that suffers from being unreliable when compared to other Arceus formes. A little niche Arceus-Fighting may have as an offensive Fighting-type that checks Extreme Killer Arceus and Steel-types is completely overshadowed by Marshadow, and taking up an Arceus slot also increases opportunity cost.</li> <li>The ability to threaten Dark- and Steel-types isn't a good enough reason to use Arceus-Fighting when much more viable Pokemon like Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Xerneas can perform in similar roles while providing their unique utility options. When dealing with Dark-types, Arceus-Fighting risks immediately handing momentum to Fairy- and Ghost-types by using Judgment, and Arceus-Fighting's unfavorable matchup against Yveltal makes its effectiveness as a check to Dark-types more questionable.</li> <li>When attempting to perform as a bulky blanket check to setup sweepers, Arceus-Fighting's mediocre matchup against Zygarde and vulnerability to Mega Salamence and Rayquaza leave it completely outclassed by other support Arceus formes like Arceus-Water and Arceus-Ground that can additionally check other prominent threats like Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Arceus-Fighting can make an attempt to differentiate itself from other support Arceus formes by running a Calm Mind set. With a coverage move to punish Ghost- or Flying-types, Arceus-Fighting can hit many Pokemon found on offensive teams decently hard and take advantage of its Speed to effectively apply offensive pressure against them.</li> <li>Calm Mind Arceus-Fighting can also differentiate itself from other Calm Mind Arceus formes due to its ability to defeat Blissey and pressure Magearna harder. However, this set inevitably has to forgo either Shadow Ball to hit Ghost-types or Ice Beam to threaten Flying-types, and it is very easily checked by Fairy-types and Ho-Oh. Other Calm Mind Arceus formes like Arceus-Dark, Arceus-Flying, and Arceus-Ground prove to be much better alternatives due to their superior matchups against certain archetypes and ability to appropriately customize their sets thanks to their better offensive typing.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Thunder can be used to defeat Ho-Oh with Stealth Rock support and deal more damage to Yveltal, Toxapex, and Arceus-Flying.</li> <li>Focus Blast in tandem with Fightinium Z can be considered, as the burst damage is strong enough to OHKO maximum HP support Arceus formes and Extreme Killer Arceus through Chople Berry after a Calm Mind boost and Stealth Rock damage. However, this leads to Arceus-Fighting's STAB move being inconsistent after the use of Z-Move, and the more accurate Fist Plate-boosted Judgment is just as powerful as Focus Blast.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh's enormous special bulk, resistance to Fighting, and Regenerator make it one of the hardest foes for Arceus-Fighting to deal with, and defensive variants are not even 2HKOed by +1 Arceus-Fighting after directly switching in when Stealth Rock is up. It can easily Toxic stall Arceus-Fighting or threaten back with its attacks.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Arceus-Fairy can switch into Arceus-Fighting without any concern thanks to its resistance to Fighting, high bulk, and ability to immediately threaten back with Judgment. Xerneas, as long as it is not overly weakened, can switch into Arceus-Fighting and threaten back with Moonblast. Geomancy variants can set up on it, and Choice Scarf variants can more effectively revenge kill boosted Arceus-Fighting.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Unless Arceus-Fighting has Ice Beam, Flying-types like Mega Salamence and Arceus-Flying can easily switch into Arceus-Fighting and threaten back with their STAB attacks or proceed to set up.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Psychic-types are dangerous foes that resist Judgment and can threaten Arceus-Fighting. Ultra Necrozma and Mega Mewtwo Y can switch into Arceus-Fighting at least once and threaten to OHKO it with their STAB moves. It is also worth noting that Ultra Necrozma can use its typing before Ultra Burst and Mega Mewtwo Y can use its high Special Defense to set up on Arceus-Fighting as well.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Ghost-types still pose problems to Arceus-Fighting when it uses Shadow Ball to hit them super effectively. Mega Gengar can 2HKO Arceus-Fighting before Arceus-Fighting 2HKOes Mega Gengar in a one-on-one situation. Giratina-O can survive a boosted attack from full health and retaliate with a status move, and Marshadow can steal Calm Mind boosts with Spectral Thief. All of these Pokemon can immediately create favorable matchups if they successfully pivot into Judgment.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Toxapex is one of the most troublesome answers to Arceus-Fighting due to its resistance to Judgment and access to Haze. The rarer Arceus-Poison and Mega Venusaur can also wall Arceus-Fighting with relative ease.</p> <p><strong>Status: Toxic significantly hinders Arceus-Fighting's ability to set up Calm Mind while remaining healthy, and paralysis removes Arceus-Fighting's Speed advantage over slower foes like Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Calm Mind makes Arceus-Fighting harder for opposing support Arceus formes to take down. A boost in Special Defense can also reverse the matchup against Choice Scarf Yveltal, as Yveltal struggles to 2HKO Arceus-Fighting with a Calm Mind boost.</li> <li>Judgment hits Dark- and Steel-types hard, and with offensive investment and Calm Mind boosts, it becomes powerful enough to pose a greater threat to offensive foes. Threats like Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Yveltal that lack defensive investment risk getting OHKOed by +1 Judgment with some prior damage.</li> <li>Shadow Ball has perfect coverage alongside Judgment, and it prevents Arceus-Fighting from being fodder against Mega Gengar and Lunala. Shadow Ball also punishes Psychic-types like Mewtwo and Tapu Lele, which can switch into Judgment with ease.</li> <li>Ice Beam prevents Mega Salamence and Rayquaza from easily shutting down this set and provides Arceus-Fighting with a way to OHKO Zygarde and entirely avoid a Glare or Dragon Tail. Ice Beam also maintains Arceus-Fighting's ability to hit both formes of Giratina.</li> <li>Recover allows Arceus-Fighting to stay healthy while switching into Dark-types and setting up Calm Mind.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>252 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Arceus-Fighting to fully take advantage of its Speed, making it tie at worst with other Arceus formes and making it an acceptable check to Mega Lucario. Maximum Special Attack EVs allow Arceus-Fighting to hit foes as hard as possible, increasing the chance it can be an effective threat against offensive teams that may struggle switching into it.</li> <li>Fist Plate and Multitype enable the use of Arceus-Fighting with a Fighting-type Judgment.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Arceus-Fighting's weakness to common Fairy- and Fighting-types restrict its opportunity to switch into many Pokemon in the tier. Lack of bulk investment further diminishes the chance that Arceus-Fighting can switch into a foe without getting 2HKOed. Safe pivoting is generally needed to bring in Arceus-Fighting unharmed, but switching into Dark-types or double switching into predicted Steel-types to threaten them are other options.</li> <li>Note that Arceus-Fighting's performance is very matchup-dependent, so it will be easily taken down even if it has set up. Choice Scarf Xerneas can switch into Arceus-Fighting multiple times, Mega Gengar can be troublesome if it traps unboosted Arceus-Fighting, and faster threats like Ultra Necrozma and Mega Mewtwo Y can easily OHKO Arceus-Fighting regardless of its Calm Mind boosts. Consider relying on a hit-and-run playstyle until these threats are dealt with.</li> <li>Matchups are relevant against defensive teams as well. Though Calm Mind-boosted Arceus-Fighting can effectively pressure Blissey, it struggles to break through Pokemon like Ho-Oh and Toxapex even with entry hazards. If either of these Pokemon exist on the opposing team, Arceus-Fighting will simply have to hope that it will generate momentum with double switching.</li> <li>Overall, Arceus-Fighting needs team support like a Stealth Rock setter, solid switch-ins to Fairy- and Flying-types, and effective countermeasures against faster foes and various Pokemon on defensive teams that resist Fighting.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Mega Gengar is a useful offensive partner, as Fairy-types like Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy risk getting trapped if they attempt to switch into Arceus-Fighting. Passive foes like Toxapex are vulnerable to Mega Gengar as well. Mega Gengar can also choose to run various options to hinder Arceus-Fighting's checks by forcing a trade with Destiny Bond or potentially removing Mega Salamence and Rayquaza with Icy Wind.</li> <li>Ho-Oh is going to be very difficult to handle, as defensive variants can check Arceus-Fighting even when Stealth Rock is up and immediately proceed to remove the entry hazard with Defog. Pokemon like Mega Salamence and Primal Kyogre can be considered appropriate offensive checks, and the former can switch into Ho-Oh more reliably. Offensive Stealth Rock users like Primal Groudon and Dialga are necessary to prevent Ho-Oh from pivoting into attacks liberally.</li> <li>Magearna is a helpful partner thanks to its ability to pivot into Fairy- and Flying-type attacks, as well as providing Arceus-Fighting with cleric support. Steel-types like Ferrothorn tend to switch into Magearna, and Magearna can take advantage of this to allow Arceus-Fighting to switch into an ideal setup target unharmed.</li> <li>Offensive partners like Xerneas and Yveltal can benefit from the pressure that Arceus-Fighting applies on Steel-types. Choice Scarf Xerneas can threaten Ultra Necrozma and Mega Salamence, while Yveltal can pressure Toxapex and other special walls, work with Arceus-Fighting to weaken Magearna, and threaten Ghost- and Psychic-types. These offensive partners can also pressure Mega Sableye.</li> </ul> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Flame Plate can be run with another Z-Move user, but without Firium Z, the increased difficulty of breaking through Primal Groudon renders Arceus-Fire even less viable.</li> <li>Arceus-Fire's horrible defensive typing and entry hazard weaknesses render a possible defensive set with Recover and Roar to check Geomancy Xerneas unviable. Psych Up can be run to stop Geomancy Xerneas and attempt to countersweep, but such a set serves little other purpose. Both sets are also outclassed by the already niche Arceus-Poison.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey</strong>: Chansey and Blissey easily wall Arceus-Fire with their colossal special bulk, damage Arceus-Fire with Toxic, and prevent it from getting enough Calm Mind boosts to break through them with Confide.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Arceus-Rock, Tyranitar, and Mega Diancie all resist Fire, are not hit super effectively by Electric- or Ice-type coverage, and retaliate with super effective STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre: Primal Kyogre is immune to Fire due to Primordial Sea, can OHKO Arceus-Fire with its powerful Water-type attacks, and is bulky enough to easily take a Thunder. However, it can be chipped low enough for +1 Thunder to KO.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh resists Fire, can easily heal off damage from unboosted Thunders with Regenerator or Recover, and can damage Arceus-Fire with Toxic or Brave Bird in return. However, it must keep Stealth Rock off its side of the field, or else +1 Thunder will KO after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Although one of the main goals of Arceus-Fire is to lure and KO Primal Groudon, Primal Groudon can easily win one-on-one. While offensive sets can be OHKOed by a boosted Z-Move, defensive sets can survive when at full health and OHKO in return with Precipice Blades.</p> <p><strong>Arceus Ground</strong>: Arceus-Ground's super effective Ground-type STAB moves can OHKO or 2HKO Arceus-Fire, and offensive variants Speed tie. Arceus-Ground can be KOed by +1 Inferno Overdrive depending on its bulk investment, however.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers: Ultra Necrozma outspeeds Arceus-Fire, KOes with super effective Neuroforce-boosted Earthquake or Light That Burns the Sky, and can also survive an attack to set up due to the type change gained from Ultra Burst. Mega Mewtwo Y and Mega Mewtwo X outspeed Arceus-Fire, hit it for heavy damage with their STAB attacks, and can survive any unboosted attack. Marshadow can revenge kill Arceus-Fire if it is sufficiently chipped at.</p> <p><strong>Lugia: Lugia can easily tank a boosted attack thanks to Multiscale and phaze Arceus-Fire.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong> Toxic sets Arceus-Fire on a timer, and accumulating poison damage makes it easier to revenge kill. Paralysis leaves it outsped by slower threats such as Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and Ho-Oh, which can KO Arceus-Fire or heal themselves before Arceus-Fire can attack.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Calm Mind allows Arceus-Fire to boost its Special Attack to threatening levels, allowing it to claim many key KOs it would not be able to unboosted. The Special Defense boost also allows it to set up somewhat more easily against special attackers and makes it more difficult for specially oriented Choice Scarf users to revenge kill it.</li> <li>Fire Blast is the STAB attack of choice. With Firium Z, it becomes Inferno Overdrive, a devastatingly powerful one-time nuke after being boosted by Calm Mind. Against Primal Groudon, its damage output is further boosted by harsh sunlight, dealing up to 83% to defensive Primal Groudon with a Timid nature after a boost while offensive Primal Groudon is OHKOed 50% of the time and most of the time after Stealth Rock damage taken as regular Groudon.</li> <li>Overheat's Special Attack drop heavily limits Arceus-Fire's ability to sustain a sweep. However, this move provides an even more powerful Z-Move and can be used if eliminating Primal Groudon is the main priority of this set. The increase in power is noticeable; with a Modest nature, +1 Inferno Overdrive has a small chance to outright OHKO defensive Primal Groudon after only Stealth Rock damage.</li> <li>Despite its unreliable accuracy against targets other than Primal Kyogre, Thunder is necessary to hit many specially bulky Pokemon that resist Fire, notably Ho-Oh, Primal Kyogre, Arceus-Water, and Toxapex, super effectively. After Stealth Rock, +1 Thunder KOes standard defensive Ho-Oh while dealing heavy damage to Primal Kyogre, Arceus-Water, and Toxapex.</li> <li>Ice Beam rounds out Arceus-Fire's coverage by hitting Dragon-types such as Zygarde-C and Mega Salamence while also providing a consistent way of damaging Arceus-Ground.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum Special Attack investment ensures Arceus-Fire hits as hard as possible.</li> <li>Maximum Speed with a Timid nature allows Arceus-Fire to outspeed or Speed tie with as many threats as possible, notably opposing Arceus formes, Mega Salamence, and Mega Lucario. This is especially important due to Arceus-Fire's lower bulk, as it needs to outspeed and KO said threats to avoid taking heavy damage, which could easily cut a sweep attempt short.</li> <li>A Modest nature can be used to maximize damage against slower foes, especially Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre, but this leaves Arceus-Fire much more vulnerable to attackers within and slightly below its Speed tier.</li> <li>Firium Z allows Arceus-Fire to use Inferno Overdrive once, a powerful nuke that breaks through Primal Groudon and other threats, especially when boosted.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Try to gain a free turn to set up Calm Mind against Steel-types and Fairy-types that Arceus-Fire forces out, either through double switches or by coming into a resisted attack. If possible, avoid status and Leech Seed, as they limit Arceus-Fire's effectiveness at wallbreaking, either by making it easier to revenge kill or by setting it on a timer, but it's still possible to wallbreak even when afflicted.</li> <li>Due to accumulating passive damage, Inferno Overdrive's one-time nature, and the threat of revenge killers, Arceus-Fire will often only have one attempt to set up and wallbreak, so make sure that it can make the most of it.</li> <li>Know how much damage Arceus-Fire can deal to foes such as Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre, and try to wear them down into KO range with entry hazards, status or chip damage from teammates, or by chipping at them with an appropriate move as they come in.</li> <li>Targets that force Arceus-Fire to use Inferno Overdrive to KO them can bait its Z-Move by pivoting into a Fire-resistant or -immune Pokemon such as Primal Kyogre. When set up in front of such a target, consider the possibility of punishing such a switch by setting up Calm Mind again or hitting the switch-in with the appropriate coverage move. However, such predictions are extremely risky, and guessing wrong will be harshly punished.</li> <li>Against teams with Blissey or Chansey, Arceus-Fire will not be of much use by itself, as it won't be able to break through them and can only be used to force predictable switches. However, if you have ways of luring or trapping Blissey or Chansey, such as mixed Primal Kyogre, Knock Off Yveltal, and Shadow Tag users, then Arceus-Fire can be a potential wincon.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Primal Kyogre heavily appreciates the removal of Primal Groudon and can also help Arceus-Fire burst through Primal Groudon by damaging it with Earthquake or Ice Beam. Primal Kyogre can help take on Ground- and Rock-types and Ho-Oh for Arceus-Fire while inviting in Grass-types like Ferrothorn that Arceus-Fire can set up on. It can also break through Chansey and Blissey with Liquidation. While niche, Choice Scarf Kyogre can clean up teams once Primal Groudon has been lured and KOed by Arceus-Fire.</li> <li>Xerneas also enjoys Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh being heavily weakened or KOed, and it is able to chip at Primal Groudon for Arceus-Fire. Xerneas can also lure in Steel-types for Arceus-Fire to set up on.</li> <li>Giratina-O, Mega Salamence, Zygarde-C, and Celesteela defensively check Ground-types and Primal Groudon to various extents. The former two also provide entry hazard removal to alleviate Arceus-Fire's crippling Stealth Rock weakness.</li> <li>Primal Groudon offers a switch-in to Primal Kyogre as well as a powerful and consistent Stealth Rock setter and another way of checking Fairy-types.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM can also provide Stealth Rock support and is a much more solid check to Xerneas.</li> <li>Other Pokemon that can lure or trap Chansey and Blissey, such Knock Off Yveltal and Shadow Tag users such as Mega Gengar and Gothitelle, can allow Arceus-Fire to break through defensive teams once its primary checks have been removed.</li> </ul> "

  "Arceus-Flying": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Arceus-Flying is an excellent Calm Mind sweeper thanks to its Flying typing, which allows it to viably run a mono-attacking Calm Mind + Refresh set that can go one-on-one against a majority of Ubers's bulkier Pokemon, with support Necrozma-DM being one notable example.</li> <li>Arceus-Flying is the only Arceus forme that is immune to Ground-type attacks, Spikes, and Sticky Web, which allows more opportunities for it to switch in, and it can be a solid check to hyper offense teams that rely on Sticky Web as well.</li> <li>Arceus-Flying is also immune to Toxic Spikes, a trait that bolsters its staying power against teams that rely on them to wear down their foes.</li> <li>Arceus-Flying's Calm Mind set is the only viable set it has that enables it to stand out in the Ubers tier, and it does not have the breathing room to effectively run anything else without being outclassed by other Flying-types or Arceus formes.</li> <li>While Arceus-Flying has the ability to stallbreak with its Calm Mind set, it has questionable matchups against three stall staples in the form of Toxapex, Chansey, and Blissey, which can stall Arceus-Flying out by using moves that remove Special Attack boosts.</li> <li>While it is immune to all of the other entry hazards, Arceus-Flying is still hit hard by Stealth Rock, which hampers its defensive utility. Stealth Rock can be a pain to switch into, especially when Arceus-Flying has taken damage earlier on in the match, where it is then forced to use Recover and forfeit momentum in the process.</li> <li>With Mega Salamence, Ho-Oh, and Yveltal being common Flying-type threats in Ubers, most competent teams will already have checks to Arceus-Flying by proxy, which also means that it has to compete with these Pokemon for a team slot, since they offer more defensive utility and have more immediate power than Arceus-Flying does.</li> <li>Arceus-Flying is hit neutrally by plenty of Pokemon in Ubers and only has a small number of resistances, two of which are against uncommon types, and has common weaknesses to Rock-, Electric-, and Ice-type attacks, all of which undermine Arceus-Flying's defensive prowess.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Arceus-Flying doesn't have the room to viably run other moves unless it wants to be outclassed by other Arceus formes.</li> <li>Earth Power and Fire Blast can be used over Refresh on the Calm Mind set to provide more coverage. Earth Power allows Arceus-Flying to hit grounded Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon, as well as Primal Groudon and Toxapex, for more damage. Fire Blast hurts airborne Steel-types such as Celesteela and Skarmory, and it can seriously hurt both Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor due to their 4x weakness to Fire-type attacks, meaning Arceus-Flying won't have to wait a turn to set up Calm Mind before attacking. However, giving up Refresh severely hurts its matchup against defensive teams when it doesn't have the ability to remove status conditions. At this point, Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Dark will outclass Arceus-Flying as a Calm Mind Arceus forme due to their superior defensive typings.</li> <li>A support set with Toxic, Recover, Judgment, and a choice between Defog, Earth Power, or Fire Blast could be used, but with a Stealth Rock weakness, a typing that baits in Necrozma-DM, and not a lot of resistances under Arceus-Flying's belt, its usefulness is borderline nonexistent.</li> <li>A Swords Dance set with Fly, Earthquake, and either Extreme Speed or Stone Edge with Flyinium Z equipped could be used to catch some of its specially defensive checks off guard, but Arceus-Flying is outclassed as a Flying-type physical sweeper by Mega Salamence and Rayquaza.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Stealth Rock</strong>: Upon switching into Stealth Rock, Arceus-Flying loses 25% of its health, which, combined with its typing offering very few resistances, undermines its defensive prowess and forces Arceus-Flying to have to use Recover more often, which can forfeit momentum. Stealth Rock also puts it dangerously close to being in range of Mega Lucario's combination of Meteor Mash and Bullet Punch, a Pokemon that Arceus-Flying can typically check.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Tyranitar, Mega Tyranitar, Mega Diancie, and Arceus-Rock resist Arceus-Flying's Judgment and retaliate with super effective Rock-type attacks. Both Tyranitar and Mega Tyranitar receive a Special Defense boost when Sand Stream is active, which makes Judgment do very little damage against them. Choice Band Tyranitar has a high chance to OHKO Arceus-Flying from full HP with Stone Edge, and Mega Tyranitar uses Arceus-Flying as setup fodder. Mega Diancie is not 2HKOed by Arceus-Flying's unboosted Judgment and can 2HKO back with Diamond Storm, and Arceus-Rock wins the Calm Mind war against Arceus-Flying.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh: Thanks to a titanic Special Defense stat and access to both Recover and Regenerator, Ho-Oh can stomach Arceus-Flying's Judgment and heal off the damage fairly easily. Offensive sets are able to 2HKO Arceus-Flying with Brave Bird, and +1 Supersonic Skystrike from the Curse set has a very high chance to OHKO Arceus-Flying from full. Defensive sets are not 2HKOed by +1 Judgment and can pressure Arceus-Flying into using Refresh or Recover by using Sacred Fire and Toxic. However, if Stealth Rock is up on Ho-Oh's side of the field, it will have a much harder time in walling Arceus-Flying.</p> <p><strong>Toxapex</strong>: Toxapex can stall Arceus-Flying out by using Haze to remove Special Attack boosts gained from Calm Mind, as well as utilizing its Regenerator ability. Toxapex also has great special bulk, which allows it to eat up Arceus-Flying's Judgment with little trouble, especially after declawing it with Haze, and it can use a combination of Recover and its Regenerator ability to heal itself after being attacked by Arceus-Flying.</p> <p><strong>Lugia</strong>: Thanks to Lugia's massive bulk and access to Multiscale, it has the ability to shrug off any attacks that Arceus-Flying can throw at it, heal off the damage with Recover, and phaze it out with Whirlwind. Lugia can also use Toxic and Ice Beam to pressure Arceus-Flying into using Refresh and Recover. However, should Arceus-Flying be the last Pokemon on its team that is able to battle, Lugia will lose one-on-one to it, since Whirlwind will no longer work in this scenario.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Necrozma-DM, Magearna, Celesteela, and Dialga can wall Arceus-Flying. Magearna has the bulk to stomach boosted attacks and can use Heart Swap to steal Calm Mind boosts. An unboosted Searing Sunraze Smash from offensive variants of Necrozma-DM can knock Arceus-Flying out with a combination of Stealth Rock and a small amount of chip damage, and thanks to its solid natural bulk, Necrozma-DM can use Arceus-Flying as setup fodder. However, support variants of Necrozma-DM lose to a healthy Arceus-Flying thanks to low PP on Sunsteel Strike as well as Refresh getting rid of poison from Necrozma-DM's Toxic. Celesteela pressures Arceus-Flying to use Recover and Refresh fairly often thanks to the combination of Leech Seed and Toxic, and it has the bulk to take several boosted attacks from Judgment. Dialga can set up Stealth Rock in front of Arceus-Flying with little fear and can use Roar to phaze it out, removing Calm Mind boosts and potentially forcing Arceus-Flying to switch into Stealth Rock later on.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Zekrom and Arceus-Electric resist Arceus-Flying's Judgment and fire back with super effective Electric-type attacks. Zekrom's Bolt Strike OHKOes Arceus-Flying from full HP, and Arceus-Electric wins the Calm Mind war.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Chansey: With the help of Confide, both Blissey and Chansey are able to strip Arceus-Flying of its Special Attack boosts from Calm Mind and proceed to stall it out. However, variants that don't use Confide will lose to Arceus-Flying.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Kyurem-W and Arceus-Ice cannot switch into Arceus-Flying, especially when Stealth Rock is up on their side of the field, but they can offensively pressure it with their super effective Ice-type STAB moves. Choice Specs Kyurem-W's Ice Beam OHKOes an unboosted Arceus-Flying from full HP, and Arceus-Ice comes out on top in the Calm Mind war.</p> <p><strong>Ultra Necrozma: Ultra Necrozma has the ability to use Arceus-Flying as setup fodder by staying as Necrozma-DM to resist and stomach a boosted Judgment to raise its Attack with Swords Dance. After Ultra Burst, +2 Stone Edge OHKOes Arceus-Flying from full HP, and +2 Photon Geyser and an unboosted Light That Burns the Sky can OHKO Arceus-Flying after Stealth Rock. However, Ultra Necrozma can't switch into Arceus-Flying very well after Ultra Burst due to losing Necrozma-DM's Steel typing.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Calm Mind boosts Arceus-Flying's Special Attack and Special Defense, enabling it to muscle past bulkier Pokemon and stomach opposing special attacks more easily.</li> <li>Refresh rids Arceus-Flying of any status conditions, which bolsters its staying power against the many Toxic users in Ubers such as Necrozma-DM, opposing Arceus formes, Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Chansey.</li> <li>Recover helps Arceus-Flying regain its HP when it has been chipped away at by opposing attacks, Stealth Rock, and status ailments such as poison or burn.</li> <li>Judgment is a powerful Flying-type STAB move with no drawbacks.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Sky Plate is required to turn Arceus into Arceus-Flying and Judgment into a Flying-type STAB move.</li> <li>252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature enable Arceus-Flying to Speed tie with opposing Arceus formes and Mega Salamence and outspeed everything slower such as Mega Lucario, Mega Diancie, and Rayquaza.</li> <li>248 HP EVs allow Arceus-Flying to be as bulky as possible while hitting an odd number of HP to allow an extra switch into Stealth Rock, and it ensures that Primal Groudon's Stone Edge never OHKOes Arceus-Flying after Stealth Rock, and Necrozma-DM's Searing Sunraze Smash can't OHKO from full HP.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Arceus-Flying makes for a good lead thanks to its Judgment not having any immunities, and Arceus-Flying's natural Speed and Special Attack are quite respectable right off the bat. Not many Pokemon that are hit neutrally by Flying-type attacks appreciate taking Arceus-Flying's Judgment, even when it's unboosted, so don't be afraid to play aggressively when the opposing team can't stomach Arceus-Flying's attacks very well.</li> <li>Arceus-Flying can comfortably switch in versus passive Pokemon that can't effectively break it, such as support Necrozma-DM, support Arceus formes, Mega Sableye, and support Primal Groudon variants that lack a Rock-type move, and proceed to use them as setup fodder. It can also come in on predicted Ground-type attacks from the likes of Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>Use Refresh whenever Arceus-Flying is afflicted with a status condition to bolster its staying power against status users to prevent having to use Recover sooner than necessary, which can forfeit momentum. Refresh also allows Arceus-Flying to act as a status absorber for its teammates.</li> <li>Arceus-Flying will have trouble switching in versus offensive teams due to its weakness to Stealth Rock and access to only a handful of resistances, so avoid directly switching into most attacks unless Arceus-Flying resists them, takes little neutral damage, or is immune to whatever is being used.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Due to its limited defensive utility, Arceus-Flying is used to its fullest potential on offensive archetypes such as hyper offense and bulky offense teams where defensive synergy isn't as crucial as it would be on a bulkier team build. Because of this, Arceus-Flying pairs well with other offensive Pokemon that take out many of Arceus-Flying's checks and counters. Pokemon such as offensive Necrozma-DM, Ultra Necrozma, offensive Primal Groudon, Marshadow, Primal Kyogre, and Mega Lucario offensively synergize well with Arceus-Flying, as they're able to knock out the Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon that give Arceus-Flying trouble. Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Ultra Necrozma, in particular, are also able to remove Toxapex from play. In return, Arceus-Flying is able to render many of the threats that give these Pokemon trouble as setup fodder. For example, Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Mega Lucario appreciate Arceus-Flying's ability to beat support Arceus-Ground in a one-on-one battle.</li> <li>Defog users such as Giratina-O, Xerneas, and Mega Latias are crucial partners for Arceus-Flying, as they get rid of Stealth Rock. All three of these Pokemon are not weak to Stealth Rock, which means that a Stealth Rock weakness isn't stacked when using them alongside Arceus-Flying. Mega Latias, in particular, also has access to Healing Wish, a move that allows Arceus-Flying to play more aggressively earlier on in the match and not care about the damage and status conditions it will take, and it allows Arceus-Flying to switch in without taking any damage from attacks when Healing Wish is used by Mega Latias.</li> <li>Arceus-Flying appreciates entry hazard setters that help it wear down opposing threats to make sweeping easier later in the game. Stealth Rock setters such as Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, Excadrill, and Dialga pair well with Arceus-Flying due to their good matchups against Rock- and Steel-type Pokemon, while Deoxys-S and Cloyster can set Spikes on hyper offense teams.</li> </ul> "

  "Arceus-Ghost": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Good all-around stats and a Ghost typing make Arceus-Ghost one of the best spinblockers in Ubers.</li> <li>Ghost is a fantastic offensive typing thanks to its lack of resistances; this lets Arceus-Ghost force out the majority of the tier, giving it free turns to set up with Swords Dance.</li> <li>As a result of its natural bulk and typing, Arceus-Ghost can check Mega Lucario and Necrozma-DM, two Pokemon that, without Sticky Web set on their side of the field, are particularly threatening to Sticky Web teams.</li> <li>Arceus-Ghost is very one-dimensional, as any set other than Swords Dance is outclassed by other Arceus formes.</li> <li>Arceus-Ghost's lack of notable resistances makes it hard for it to switch in without taking a big hit. This makes Arceus-Ghost's defensive capability quite limited.</li> <li>This limitation makes it difficult to justify using Arceus-Ghost on balance and stall archetypes, especially considering how much they rely on other Arceus formes to check threatening Pokemon and provide Defog support.</li> <li>It is hindered by the prominence of Pokemon that check it, such as Marshadow and Yveltal.</li> <li>Despite having a vast movepool, its coverage options are weak, and this makes Arceus-Ghost very reliant on its STAB move. This is a problem due to its main STAB move having low PP and taking two turns to use, which allows your opponent to play around attacks after Arceus-Ghost has used Never-Ending Nightmare.</li> <li>Overall, Arceus-Ghost is a great choice for a few specialized teams that require spinblocking. However, its opportunity cost of taking up an Arceus slot and the Z-Crystal while being weak to two top-tier threats means it is difficult to justify on any other team.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>A Calm Mind set can be used to take advantage of its great natural bulk and offensive typing. However, it lacks immediate power, and Arceus-Ghost's lack of resistances makes it difficult to set up enough Calm Mind boosts to be threatening.</li> <li>Ice Beam is an option to consistently beat Mega Salamence and Zygarde-C. However, the former is always KOed by a boosted Never-Ending Nightmare, even accounting for an Attack drop from Intimidate, while the latter can be used as setup fodder with Substitute.</li> <li>Refresh allows Arceus-Ghost to relieve itself of status, which can be helpful if it was statused on the switch. However, Substitute lets Arceus-Ghost avoid status and has other uses as well, making Refresh an inferior choice in most situations.</li> <li>A support set utilizing Defog may seem usable due to Arceus-Ghost's inability to be trapped and its ability to defeat Mega Lucario. However, its lack of relevant resistances makes this set outclassed by other Arceus formes.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Yveltal</strong>: Yveltal resists Ghost and only takes neutral damage from Brick Break. In return, it either OHKOes Arceus-Ghost with Dark Pulse or Foul Play or removes entry hazards on the field with Defog. However, it must be wary of Stone Edge, and offensive variants are KOed by a +2 Never-Ending Nightmare after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Marshadow</strong>: Marshadow outspeeds Arceus-Ghost and OHKOes it with Spectral Thief, stealing any boosts Arceus-Ghost has accumulated and threatening to countersweep. Even if Sticky Web is on the field, Marshadow can pick off a weakened Arceus-Ghost with Shadow Sneak. However, Marshadow can't switch into Arceus-Ghost, and loses if Arceus-Ghost is at full health with Sticky Web on the field.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types resist Arceus-Ghost's STAB move and threaten it out with their own super effective STAB moves. Arceus-Dark has enough bulk to take a boosted Brick Break and KO back with Judgment or use Defog and remove entry hazards. It also has Recover to ensure that it can check Arceus-Ghost throughout a match. Mega Gyarados lowers Arceus-Ghost's Attack with Intimidate before its Mega Evolution and can set up Dragon Dance on Arceus-Ghost. Tyranitar can survive a +2 Brick Break if it's holding a Chople Berry and OHKO back with Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Fast Ghost-types: Ghost-types can't switch in safely; however, once they have safely switched in, they can threaten Arceus-Ghost with their STAB moves. Mega Gengar naturally outspeeds and OHKOes Arceus-Ghost with Hex if it is statused, or KOes with Shadow Ball if Arceus-Ghost has taken chip damage. If Mega Gengar is using Substitute, Arceus-Ghost will struggle combating it. Lunala can outspeed Arceus-Ghost if holding a Choice Scarf and OHKO with Moongeist Beam after Stealth Rock damage. Necrozma-DW-based Ultra Necrozma outspeeds Arceus-Ghost after Ultra Burst and dents it with Moongeist Beam, though it won't OHKO. However, these Pokemon lose to Arceus-Ghost if it's behind a Substitute or Sticky Web is on their side of the field.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde-C: Zygarde-C shrugs off attacks from Arceus-Ghost thanks to its titanic bulk and stalls out Shadow Force with Substitute. In return, it can inflict status on Arceus-Ghost or phaze it using Dragon Tail. However, defensive variants without Coil let Arceus-Ghost set up with Substitute, and Ice Beam will 2HKO Zygarde-C as well. In addition, if Zygarde hasn't transformed into Complete forme, it falls to a +2 Never-Ending Nightmare after one layer of Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Normal-types: Normal-types are immune to Arceus-Ghost's STAB move, forcing it to use a rather weak coverage move to beat them. If used with a Ghost-type, Arceus-Ghost can be stalled out indefinitely, as Shadow Force requires two turns to use. However, Arceus-Ghost beats every Normal-type one-on-one if it's using Substitute.</p> ",

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Swords Dance allows Arceus-Ghost to boost its Attack and defeat bulkier Pokemon such as support Arceus formes with a boosted Z-Move.</li> <li>Shadow Force is Arceus-Ghost's strongest STAB move. It allows it to use a 190-Base Power Never-Ending Nightmare, which can OHKO the majority of bulky Pokemon when combined with Swords Dance boosts. However, the base move has limited PP and takes two turns to use, so your opponent can play around it by switching into a Normal-type or setting up a Substitute.</li> <li>Brick Break grants perfect coverage alongside Arceus-Ghost's STAB attack, providing it with a way to super effectively hit Normal- and Dark-types.</li> <li>Stone Edge can be used instead to beat Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Mega Salamence while boosted without using being reliant on its Z-Move.</li> <li>Substitute is used to avoid status moves and Dragon Tail, helping Arceus-Ghost to set up on passive Pokemon that rely on status, such as Chansey, Celesteela, and defensive Zygarde-C. It also prevents Arceus-Ghost from being revenge killed by faster attackers or priority moves.</li> <li>Shadow Claw is an alternative STAB option that has more PP and deals damage the turn it's used, preventing your opponent from playing around it with Substitute or Normal-type switch-ins. However, its lower Base Power makes a less powerful Z-Move, so Arceus-Ghost can no longer OHKO support Arceus forms with a +2 Never-Ending Nightmare.</li> <li>Extreme Speed lets Arceus-Ghost KO Deoxys-A before it can move and revenge kill weakened sweepers.</li> <li>Recover provides Arceus-Ghost with recovery, allowing it to spinblock throughout the course of a match.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>A Jolly nature with maximum Speed investment allow Arceus-Ghost to make the best use of its good Speed tier. This lets it Speed tie with Mega Salamence and other Arceus formes, and it can outspeed Mega Lucario and everything slower.</li> <li>Maximum Attack investment allows Arceus-Ghost to hit as hard as possible. This allows it to KO defensive Primal Kyogre with +2 Shadow Force after Stealth Rock and defensive non-transformed Zygarde with a +2 Never-Ending Nightmare after a layer of Spikes.</li> <li>Ghostium Z allows Arceus-Ghost to use Never-Ending Nightmare, which is needed to break through defensive teams.</li> <li>Spooky Plate can be used if one of Arceus-Ghost's teammates is already using a Z-Crystal. However, this is generally an inferior option, as Arceus-Ghost struggles against the walls it's supposed to defeat without the help of a Z-Move.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Arceus-Ghost should be switched into potential Rapid Spin users such as Excadrill and Cloyster in order to spinblock.</li> <li>Swords Dance Arceus-Ghost is primarily a wallbreaker, capable of demolishing any non-resistant foe with a boosted Never-Ending Nightmare.</li> <li>Due to its high Speed and access to Extreme Speed, it can also function as a sweeper late-game.</li> <li>Be mindful of Arceus-Ghost's health. While it does have good natural bulk, Arceus-Ghost is weak to the two most common priority attacks in Ubers, Sucker Punch from Yveltal and Shadow Sneak from Marshadow and Giratina-O.</li> <li>Knowing when to use Never-Ending Nightmare is important. It should primarily be used to eliminate a problematic wall for Arceus-Ghost's teammates. If a Z-Move won't KO a foe and open a hole for a teammate, it's often better to save the Z-Move.</li> <li>Be mindful of your opponent switching into something Arceus-Ghost needs its Z-Move to kill. They may switch into a Pokemon that resists Ghost as an attempt to bait out its Z-Move.</li> <li>Due to Shadow Force taking two turns to use and having low PP, Arceus-Ghost can be stalled out by most defensive Pokemon after its Z-Move has been used.</li> <li>After its Z-Move has been used, teams with a Normal-type and a Ghost-type can stall out Arceus-Ghost by constantly switching, making it useless.</li> <li>Since Shadow Force takes two turns to use and Arceus-Ghost's coverage moves are weak, boosting or double switching on a predicted switch is often better than outright attacking.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Stealth Rock is mandatory to guarantee a few KOs such as the OHKO on offensive Yveltal and defensive Primal Kyogre with +2 Never Ending Nightmare. A good Stealth Rock user is Tyranitar, which can Pursuit trap Ghost-types and take on Yveltal and Mega Salamence, two of the biggest threats to the Sticky Web teams Arceus-Ghost typically finds itself on.</li> <li>Suicide leads appreciate Arceus-Ghost's ability to spinblock and keep entry hazards on the field after they've fainted. Notable leads include Smeargle and Shuckle, which can set Sticky Web that is needed for Arceus-Ghost to beat faster foes such as Marshadow and Ultra Necrozma, and Cloyster, which can set Spikes and allow Arceus-Ghost to KO non-transformed Zygarde and defensive Primal Groudon with a +2 Never-Ending Nightmare.</li> <li>Primal Groudon stands out as an appealing partner. Arceus-Ghost defeats support Arceus formes, both Giratina formes, and Lugia, which can pave the way for Primal Groudon to sweep. In return, it can set Stealth Rock, defeat Marshadow, and lure in and KO Zygarde-C if carrying Hidden Power Ice.</li> <li>Yveltal checks Ghost-types such as Mega Gengar and Marshadow. It can also use Taunt to prevent Defog, which is the only way to remove hazards aside from Rapid Spin.</li> <li>Xerneas defeats Marshadow, Zygarde-C, and Dark-types for Arceus-Ghost. In return, Arceus-Ghost destroys special walls for Xerneas.</li> <li>Mega Lucario takes on the Normal- and Dark-types that Arceus-Ghost has trouble breaking through. Together, they can overwhelm each other's checks, such as Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Mega Salamence checks Marshadow with Intimidate and draws in and dents physical walls such as Primal Groudon. In return, Arceus-Ghost breaks the majority of defensive answers to Mega Salamence, which can allow it to sweep.</li> </ul> "

  "Arceus-Grass": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Arceus-Grass is a somewhat risky Arceus forme to employ for many teams due to its general inconsistency. What Arceus-Grass will accomplish is largely dependent on the matchup, and it will be inevitably reliant on its teammates to patch up its many shortcomings.</li> <li>Nonetheless, Arceus-Grass's lone Grass typing allows it to differentiate itself from other support Arceus formes with its ability to check threatening Pokemon like Double Dance Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground, pivot into Primal Kyogre, and most notably, handle Zygarde-C thanks to its resistance to Thousand Arrows, access to recovery, and ability to threaten Zygarde-C with Ice Beam. Access to Meadow Plate-boosted Grass Knot is also notable, as it has considerably high damage output against many Pokemon in the tier. Arceus-Grass's obligation to pack various coverage moves combined with its strong Grass Knot makes it difficult to safely switch into for offensive teams.</li> <li>While Arceus-Grass's typing provides it with the aforementioned valuable niches, its common weaknesses to Fire, Flying, and Ice heavily undermine Arceus-Grass's ability to defensively check foes, obligating its team to deal with more threats than it covers. Arceus-Grass's vulnerability to Mega Gengar and Gothitelle additionally concerns players with teambuilding when using it.</li> <li>Arceus-Grass's very rigid moveset further diminishes its usefulness, as it is mostly reliant on hitting foes super effectively to threaten them and will therefore struggle against practically any all defensive teams, where Pokemon that aren't threatened by Arceus-Grass at all like Ho-Oh, Lugia, Toxapex, and Blissey are prevalent. Many balanced teams also have ample methods to threaten Arceus-Grass with common Pokemon like Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Giratina-O, which force Arceus-Grass to predict to 2HKO them on the switch.</li> <li>Arceus-Grass can be functional with appropriate team support, but the fact that it fails to blanket check many threats, doesn't provide much utility, and does little to its checks and counters limits its justifiability over other support Arceus formes.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Arceus-Grass has extreme difficulty adjusting its conventional moveset, as it is very easily checked defensively without Grass Knot, Ice Beam, and Fire Blast.</li> <li>Judgment hits Toxapex hard enough to 2HKO it with Stealth Rock damage, and it also has significantly better damage output against Marshadow and Mega Mewtwo Y. However, the loss of damage output against other Pokemon from forgoing Grass Knot makes Judgment hard to justify.</li> <li>Stone Edge 2HKOes Ho-Oh, but it has no other viable use.</li> <li>To further threaten offensive teams, Calm Mind can be used over Recover to amplify Arceus-Grass's offensive presence, but Arceus-Grass can already threaten to OHKO a myriad of threats from such archetypes and it will need two Calm Mind boosts to reach the point where it can OHKO threats like Primal Groudon and Arceus formes with Grass Knot, making it an option that generally ends up hampering Arceus-Grass's defensive capabilities instead.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Arceus-Grass's effectiveness is heavily limited against any team with Ho-Oh, as it takes minimal damage from any attack and can threaten back with Brave Bird, Sacred Fire, or Toxic. Defog variants in particular are very hard to handle, as Arceus-Grass providing Ho-Oh an opportunity to switch in will give it a chance to freely remove Stealth Rock, further narrowing options to pressure it.</p> <p><strong>Shadow Tag Users</strong>: As long as it hasn't switched into Fire Blast, Mega Gengar traps and easily removes Arceus-Grass with Sludge Wave. Gothitelle isn't significantly threatened by Arceus-Grass's attacks and thus can reliably trap and eliminate it.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey: Both Chansey and Blissey take pathetic damage from Arceus-Grass's attacks and can fully take advantage of it.</p> <p><strong>Toxapex</strong>: Due to Grass Knot having meager damage output against it, Toxapex can liberally switch into Arceus-Grass to freely set Toxic Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Though they dislike switching into Ice Beam, Yveltal and Arceus-Flying can offensively check Arceus-Grass. Yveltal has a chance to be 2HKOed by Ice Beam, but it can retaliate with Oblivion Wing if it managed to switched into an other move. Arceus-Flying risks getting 2HKOed by Ice Beam if it switches in when Stealth Rock is up, but it can otherwise set up Calm Mind against it. Lugia is not even 2HKOed by Ice Beam after Stealth Rock damage and can easily stall out Arceus-Grass with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Dialga isn't hit super effectively by any moves from Arceus-Grass and resists Grass Knot. It can threaten to 2HKO Arceus-Grass with Fire Blast or set Stealth Rock against it. Giratina completely stops Arceus-Grass and can PP stall Ice Beam as long as it hasn't been excessively pressured by Arceus-Grass's other teammates. Giratina-O can check Arceus-Grass from full HP, but it loses a considerable portion of its health with every Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Status: Toxic significantly hampers Arceus-Grass's defensive presence against Zygarde-C, Arceus-Ground, and Arceus-Water.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Grass Knot heavily damages most neutral targets, netting 2HKOs on Primal Groudon and unresisted Arceus formes with or without prior damage.</li> <li>Ice Beam targets Dragon- and Flying-types that aren't hit hard by Grass Knot. Ice Beam's ability to OHKO Mega Salamence, Rayquaza, and regular Zygarde and prevent Yveltal from freely switching into Arceus-Grass makes it indispensable.</li> <li>Fire Blast ensures that Steel-types like Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, and Magearna can't take advantage of Arceus-Grass and enables Arceus-Grass to offensively check Mega Lucario. Arceus-Grass's immunity to Leech Seed mandates the use of Fire Blast to let it pivot into and force out Ferrothorn.</li> <li>Recover allows Arceus-Grass to consistently pivot into foes like Zygarde-C, Arceus-Ground, and Arceus-Water.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Arceus-Grass to at worst Speed tie with other Arceus formes and Mega Salamence.</li> <li>176 Special Attack EVs give Arceus-Grass's Grass Knot enough power to always take out uninvested Arceus-Ground after Stealth Rock damage, score a 2HKO on offensive Primal Groudon, and have a favorable chance to OHKO Primal Kyogre and Arceus-Water with Stealth Rock up. Ice Beam will OHKO any offensive Zygarde variant after Stealth Rock damage, and Fire Blast will outright OHKO Mega Lucario and, with Stealth Rock, 2HKO offensive Necrozma-DM and Mega Gengar the majority of the time.</li> <li>The remaining EVs are invested into HP, letting Arceus-Grass avoid the 2HKO from physical Primal Kyogre's Ice Beam and the OHKO from Mega Gengar's Sludge Wave if it proves to be a necessity.</li> <li>HP EVs can be maximized for Arceus-Grass to take attacks from Arceus-Ground better in general at the cost of less damage output.</li> <li>Multitype and Meadow Plate allow the use of Arceus-Grass with boosted Grass Knot.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Arceus-Grass can acquire opportunities to switch in by switching into the small number of Pokemon it checks: Zygarde-C, Primal Kyogre, Arceus-Ground, and Arceus-Water. Even this may involve risk, as Arceus-Grass is hit super effectively by coverage moves like Ice Beam and hindered by Toxic. Pivot Arceus-Grass in appropriately so it will avoid status conditions and won't have to be pressured to use Recover too often.</li> <li>Though Arceus-Grass is capable of hitting various foes with its moves, make cautious predictions once it gets a chance to safely attack. Arceus-Grass at best 2HKOes its checks like Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM with appropriate moves, so it is vitally important to hit them as hard as possible on the switch to prevent a loss of momentum. Especially in matchups that are in Arceus-Grass's favor, an opponent will attempt to pivot into various foes that resist coverage moves to let threats like Primal Groudon and Yveltal switch into weaker moves, so analyze how the opponent reacts to Arceus-Grass when they lack a reliable switch-in.</li> <li>Setting entry hazards can facilitate this to a considerable degree by turning many possible 2HKOs into guaranteed 2HKOs. Stealth Rock is especially needed most of the time to prevent Ho-Oh from consistently walling this set and discourage other Flying-types like Yveltal from freely threatening Arceus-Grass.</li> <li>Be quick to determine Arceus-Grass's overall usefulness in the matchup. Against offensive teams, it should be given many chances to net as much damage as possible, but it will not do anything notable against teams with Ho-Oh or any defensive teams. Arceus-Grass especially cannot punish its defensive checks like Ho-Oh due to the lack of Toxic, so avoid making it needlessly remain in an unfavorable matchup.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>A Stealth Rock user is mandatory to keep Ho-Oh and other Flying-types in line. Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM both suffice for this role, and defensive variants can further reduce Ho-Oh's longevity with Toxic. More offensive teams can employ Dialga, which pressures Giratina-O and Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Arceus-Grass's team must contain a core that can blanket check a significant portion of the tier, as Arceus-Grass will be easily turned into setup fodder in instances where it fails to make correct predictions and 2HKO its switch-ins. Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh can check Steel-types that get out of hand such as Necrozma-DM and appreciate Arceus-Grass's ability to pivot into Ground-type attacks and Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>Magearna prevents Yveltal from causing serious damage to the team after threatening out Arceus-Grass. Cleric support is further appreciated, as there is a considerable chance that Arceus-Grass will be afflicted by Toxic while attempting to handle other Arceus formes. Xerneas can play a similar role as Magearna as a less durable check to Yveltal that can provide utility options like Aromatherapy, Defog, and revenge killing with a Choice Scarf set or take advantage of Arceus-Grass's ability to lure in Steel-types to clean late-game with Geomancy sets. Both Xerneas and Arceus-Grass are vulnerable to Mega Gengar and Ho-Oh, so ensure that they are properly dealt with by other teammates.</li> <li>Zygarde-C and Mega Salamence are capable of handling Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh. Both of them appreciate Arceus-Grass dealing with Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Water, and the latter especially values Arceus-Grass weakening Steel-types with Fire Blast. Giratina-O proves to be a more reliable check to Primal Groudon and can provide Defog support.</li> <li>Mega Gengar traps and removes Toxapex and special walls that can persistently wall Arceus-Grass. Many balanced and stall teams have at least one Pokemon that can defensively check Arceus-Grass and thus tend to react by switching in said check on Arceus-Grass, and this opens an opportunity for Mega Gengar to force a trade with Destiny Bond against foes like Ho-Oh and defensive Yveltal. Mega Gengar also notably traps and removes Ultra Necrozma, which can set up on Arceus-Grass.</li> <li>Offensive teammates like Rayquaza and Marshadow can take advantage of Arceus-Grass weakening or removing most of their defensive checks. Both of them can choose different movesets, as Arceus-Grass possesses moves that they will need against specific targets. To specify, Rayquaza can opt for Earthquake and have Arceus-Grass deal with Steel-types with Fire Blast, while Marshadow can forgo Hidden Power Ice and run Rock Tomb to draw in and remove Ho-Oh, run Pursuit to eliminate or cripple Mega Gengar and Gothitelle, or use Marshadium Z to alleviate Arceus-Grass's horrendous matchup against defensive teams. Physically oriented Primal Kyogre can greatly trouble many stall teams, and Arceus-Grass appreciates Primal Kyogre's ability to pivot into Fire-type moves. In return, Arceus-Grass prevents Ferrothorn from recovering with its immunity to Leech Seed and forces it out with Fire Blast.</li> <li>Tyranitar synergizes well with Arceus-Grass defensively. Choice Band variants tend to provide the best utility options with their ability to trap and eliminate Mega Gengar and Gothitelle, immensely threaten Ho-Oh, and KO or cripple Chansey and Blissey. Tyranitar also is capable of pivoting into Mega Salamence and Yveltal, which Arceus-Grass will generally attempt to avoid. In return, Arceus-Grass can facilitate Tyranitar's wallbreaking by threatening Ground-types and weakening Steel-types.</li> </ul> "

  "Arceus-Ground": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Arceus-Ground is one of the best Arceus formes in the tier, as it is able to efficiently run both offensive and defensive sets, thus making it quite easy to fit on teams.</li> <li>Offensively, Arceus-Ground has a lot to offer, as Ground-type attacks are only resisted by Bug- and Grass-types, and, although Flying-type Pokemon are immune to Arceus-Ground's attacks, it is able to run Rock-type and Ice-type coverage moves to deal heavy amounts of damage to them.</li> <li>Arceus-Ground has a lot to offer defensively as well thanks to its 120 / 120 / 120 bulk and access to brilliant utility moves such as Stealth Rock, Defog, Recover, and Toxic. Furthermore, Pokemon that can hit Arceus-Ground with super effective STAB damage are rare, with Primal Kyogre, Arceus-Water, and Ferrothorn being the only common Pokemon in the tier capable of doing so.</li> <li>Arceus-Ground has a notable drawback regardless of what set it runs. Offensive sets can find themselves revenge killed by other offensive threats, while support sets are vulnerable to being trapped and removed from the field by Shadow Tag users. Also, Toxic is capable of wearing down any set that Arceus-Ground uses.</li> <li>Despite the fact that Arceus-Ground has a good offensive matchup against Primal Groudon, it struggles to switch into the common Overheat, and it also has to be cautious of being worn down by Toxic, which is run on defensive sets.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Stone Edge can be used on support sets with a Naive or Hasty nature to specifically lure in and KO Ho-Oh, as it 2HKOes defensive sets and OHKOes offensive sets.</li> <li>Extreme Speed can be run on offensive sets, as it allows Arceus-Ground to revenge kill faster weakened foes that could otherwise potentially revenge kill it in return.</li> <li>Roar can be used on support sets to potentially prevent Arceus-Ground from being trapped by Gothitelle; however, Arceus-Ground is still susceptible to Taunt, which prevents it from using the move. Roar also prevents it from running other crucial moves in its moveset such as Ice Beam and Toxic and ultimately only ends up being useful for preventing Necrozma-DM from sweeping.</li> <li>Refresh can be used instead of Ice Beam on Calm Mind sets to prevent Arceus-Ground from being worn down by Toxic; however, this prevents it from hitting any Flying-type Pokemon and Giratina-O and means that it does significantly less damage to Zygarde-C.</li> <li>Gravity can be used on Swords Dance sets so Arceus-Ground can hit Ho-Oh, Celesteela, and Skarmory for super effective damage. However, it mostly appreciates using Stone Edge so it can deal with other Flying-type threats such as Yveltal, Mega Salamence, and Lugia.</li> <li>Substitute can be used on Calm Mind sets to prevent status, but Arceus-Ground doesn't really have the moveslot for it.</li> <li>Will-O-Wisp can be used on support sets to shut down Necrozma-DM, but in most cases Arceus-Ground prefers to run Toxic, as it wears down common threats such as Arceus-Water, both Giratina formes, Primal Kyogre, and Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Groundium Z can be used on Calm Mind sets, running Earth Power instead of Judgment in order for Arceus-Ground to use a one-time 175-Base Power Tectonic Rage, which can OHKO Necrozma-DM prior to boosting. However, running Groundium Z instead of Earth plate results in Arceus-Ground having quite poor damage output, even at +1, and becoming quite susceptible to being trapped by Gothitelle.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Lugia</strong>: Lugia is able to survive any boosted hit from Swords Dance or Calm Mind Arceus-Ground thanks to Multiscale and phaze it with Whirlwind. However, it doesn't appreciate Toxic from support sets, and it is much less efficient at checking Arceus-Ground if Stealth Rock is on the field.</p> <p><strong>Celesteela and Skarmory</strong>: Both Celesteela and Skarmory take minimal damage from any of Arceus-Ground's attacks, are immune to Toxic, and can annoy Arceus-Ground with Toxic. Celesteela can further annoy Arceus-Ground with Leech Seed, and Skarmory can recover off any damage taken with Roost. Skarmory can also phaze any setup Arceus-Ground set with Whirlwind. It should be noted though that Celesteela can just become setup fodder for Substitute Arceus-Ground sets, as Heavy Slam never breaks Arceus-Ground's Substitute without a decent amount of Attack investment.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Water</strong>: Arceus-Water takes minimal damage from most of Arceus-Ground's attacks and can dish out heavy damage with STAB Judgment. However, it can only really soft check Swords Dance Arceus-Ground if it hasn't used its Z-Move, as it is OHKOed by +2 Tectonic Rage.</p> <p><strong>Giratina and Giratina-O</strong>: Giratina-O is immune to Ground-type attacks, takes less than 50% from +2 Stone Edge from physical variants and minimal damage from Ice Beam from support sets, can inflict status on all of them, phaze them with Dragon Tail, or deal a decent amount of damage with Shadow Force or Draco Meteor. Despite the fact that Giratina lacks a Ground immunity, it takes minimal damage from any of Arceus-Ground's attacks, even being able to survive +2 Tectonic Rage from Swords Dance variants, and can easily Rest off any of the damage it takes and proceed to inflict status on Arceus-Ground or phaze it with Dragon Tail.</p> <p><strong>Gothitelle</strong>: Although it doesn't appreciate dealing with Swords Dance variants or taking boosted hits from Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, Gothitelle can PP stall any support set as well as potentially stall out Calm Mind variants as long as Arceus-Ground hasn't already started boosting.</p> <p><strong>Marshadow</strong>: Marshadow is a solid offensive answer to Arceus-Ground, invalidating Swords Dance sets because it can steal boosts with Spectral Thief and reverse sweep. Life Orb sets can also 2HKO any Arceus-Ground set after Stealth Rock damage, and although it is less common, Bulk Up Marshadium Z sets are able to OHKO offensive Arceus-Ground sets with a +1 Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Although it's not a fan of physical Arceus-Ground sets, Ho-Oh takes minimal damage from support Arceus-Ground's coverage moves, can remove Arceus-Ground's Stealth Rock with Defog, and is only really bothered by Calm Mind variants if they opt to run Thunder.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey</strong>: Both Chansey and Blissey wall any special attacking Arceus-Ground variant due to their high HP and Special Defense stats and can proceed to wear it down with Toxic and Recover off any damage that Arceus-Ground dishes out.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Grass-types naturally resist Ground-type moves and can do heavy damage with their STAB moves. However, Ferrothorn, due to its Steel typing, takes neutral damage from Judgment, and Arceus-Grass and Shaymin-S do not appreciate taking Ice Beam, especially from Calm Mind sets.</p> <p><strong>Buzzwole: Buzzwole resists Ground, has enough natural bulk to not be fazed by Ice Beam, and is only really worried about boosted Stone Edge. It can also lower Arceus-Ground's Attack with Lunge and wear it down with Toxic + Roost.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: Primal Kyogre takes minimal damage from support Arceus-Ground sets and has enough natural bulk to survive a Z-Move from offensive sets and +2 Judgment from Calm Mind variants and OHKO them in return with rain-boosted STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Swords Dance Arceus-Ground sets dislike dealing with Pokemon that outspeed it such as Choice Scarf Yveltal, Marshadow, and Ultra Necrozma. Choice Scarf Yveltal is immune to Arceus-Ground's STAB attacks and can revenge KO a +2 Arceus-Ground with Foul Play. Marshadow also poses a major threat to Swords Dance Arceus-Ground, as it can steal its boosts with Spectral Thief and proceed to KO it, and Ultra Necrozma can potentially OHKO Arceus-Ground after Stealth Rock damage.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Calm Mind boosts both Special Attack and Special Defense in order to attempt a sweep, and Arceus-Ground's strong coverage, high all-around stats, and good matchup against many physical threats make it a great user of this move.</li> <li>Judgment is a reliable STAB attack that deals strong, consistent damage.</li> <li>Ice Beam provides the best possible coverage for a specially oriented set, damaging common Ground-immune Pokemon such as Mega Salamence and Yveltal super effectively and letting Arceus-Ground easily defeat Zygarde-C.</li> <li>Recover provides longevity, helping Arceus-Ground set up multiple Calm Mind boosts and last throughout the match.</li> <li>Thunder is an option to surprise Ho-Oh, Primal Kyogre, and Celesteela, which typically wall Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, but the coverage and reliability that Ice Beam offers is usually preferred.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum Speed investment allows Arceus-Ground to outspeed as many foes as possible and at worst Speed tie with opposing Arceus formes and Mega Salamence.</li> <li>252 Special Attack EVs grant Arceus-Ground a large increase in upfront power. This lets Arceus-Ground guarantee the OHKO on offensive variants of Primal Groudon and Zygarde-C. After Stealth Rock damage, defensive variants of Primal Groudon and Zygarde-C are OHKOed most of the time, and specially defensive Necrozma-DM is 2HKOed. After one Calm Mind, Judgment also secures the 2HKO on support Arceus formes. This extra power additionally helps Arceus-Ground break through Gothitelle.</li> <li>Maximum HP investment instead of Special Attack investment is an option, granting Arceus-Ground more bulk and greater ease of switching into threats it checks. However, this spread loses immediate offensive presence, plays more reactively, and is thus outclassed by the support set, which can better justify the more defensive playstyle. It also struggles to break through Gothitelle.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Attempt to aggressively force matchups where Arceus-Ground can threaten out foes to set up Calm Mind. This can be done through leading with Arceus-Ground, double switches, or coming in on support moves such as Stealth Rock. Due to this set's lower bulk, try to avoid switching into powerful attacks, such as Primal Groudon's Overheat.</li> <li>Calm Mind Arceus-Ground can't afford to be as reactive as the support set due to its lower bulk. While it can still defensively take on most of what the support set checks, Calm Mind Arceus-Ground will sacrifice most of its HP and sweeping potential to do so. Additionally, be careful switching into Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Mega Salamence, as maximum Special Attack Overheat, Searing Sunraze Smash, and +1 Adamant Double-Edge from these respective threats are able to OHKO Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>Avoid committing to a sweep if counters such as Ho-Oh, Primal Kyogre, Celesteela, Lugia, and Blissey are alive and healthy, as they can take on even boosted Arceus-Ground. Marshadow can also outspeed Arceus-Ground and steal its Calm Mind boosts or force it out, so if Marshadow is present on the enemy team, only set up as many boosts as necessary in order to defeat the threat Arceus-Ground is currently facing.</li> <li>Take advantage of this set's unexpected damage output and Calm Mind in order to net surprise KOs or rob momentum from threats expecting to face support Arceus-Ground. Unlike the support set, Calm Mind Arceus-Ground is able to defeat Gothitelle, opposing support Arceus formes, and defensive Necrozma-DM and can set up on Yveltal, so be prepared to make the most of this to accumulate extra boosts or force key KOs.</li> <li>Be prepared to catch possible switch-ins with the right move as they come in, as the opponent might try to juggle around Ground- and Ice-resistant Pokemon to accumulate Toxic damage or try to bring in a check such as Primal Kyogre or Marshadow on a weaker attack or predicted Calm Mind.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Facade Mega Salamence is a great partner, as it is able to check Ho-Oh, one of the biggest threats to Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, with ease and take advantage of the reliance on status of many Calm Mind Arceus-Ground checks in order to power up Facade. Mega Salamence also provides an additional Primal Groudon check to make up for Arceus-Ground's lower bulk and is effective at removing Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web for Arceus-Ground with its fast, non-grounded Defog.</li> <li>Primal Groudon makes for a good teammate, being able to threaten most of Arceus-Ground's checks with its powerful STAB moves, coverage, or status. It also provides a switch-in to Primal Kyogre and Ho-Oh and sets Stealth Rock, which is greatly appreciated to keep Ho-Oh and Lugia in check.</li> <li>Ferrothorn is another strong Primal Kyogre switch-in that can also utilize its defensive typing and immunity to Toxic and Leech Seed to take on Lugia, Celesteela, and Blissey while providing support with various entry hazards, Leech Seed, and status.</li> <li>Strong Geomancy Xerneas checks are necessary as teammates, as Xerneas is often the main method in which offensive teams can take back momentum from Calm Mind Arceus-Ground. Necrozma-DM is a great answer to Xerneas and can opt to carry Ultranecrozium Z to lure and KO Ho-Oh and Primal Kyogre for Arceus-Ground or run Stone Edge for Ho-Oh on a set without Ultranecrozium Z.</li> <li>Choice Scarf Xerneas can provide crucial cleric support with Aromatherapy and revenge kills offensive threats such as Ultra Necrozma and Marshadow, both of which can be troublesome for Arceus-Ground. Xerneas can also remove troublesome hazards with Defog and lure and KO certain Arceus-Ground checks with specialized coverage moves such as Rock Slide, Close Combat, Thunder, and Hidden Power Fire. In return, Arceus-Ground checks Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM. Together they form a strong anti-offense core that can be difficult for offensive teams to handle.</li> <li>Primal Kyogre can check Ho-Oh, come in on Primal Groudon's powerful special Fire-type attacks, and lure in opposing Primal Groudon for Arceus-Ground to set up on. Primal Kyogre can also take on special walls such as Blissey with a mixed set or work in tandem with Arceus-Ground to overwhelm shared checks such as Ferrothorn and opposing Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>Gothitelle can trap Ferrothorn, Celesteela, Arceus-Water, defensive Ho-Oh, Chansey, and variants of Lugia without Dragon Tail, possibly paving the way for an Arceus-Ground sweep. It can also threaten to trap Defog users in order to keep Stealth Rock up against Ho-Oh, making Ho-Oh much easier to manage.</li> <li>Other Pokemon with a good matchup against bulkier teams, such as Life Orb Yveltal and wallbreaking variants of the aforementioned Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Primal Kyogre, can compensate for Arceus-Ground's inability to pressure defensive teams due to the common presence of special walls that Arceus-Ground cannot break.</li> </ul> "

Running Stealth Rock on Arceus-Ground also means that other teammates such as Primal Groudon don't have to run it, thus making them free to run more offensive sets.</li> <li>Toxic is a useful option to run on this set, as it allows Arceus-Ground to not be completely walled by Ho-Oh, and it also helps wear down other foes that commonly switch into Arceus-Ground's attacks such as Arceus-Water, Giratina-O, and Lugia.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Earth Plate is used to turn Arceus into Arceus-Ground turn Judgment into a Ground-type move, and boost the power of Judgment.</li> <li>24 Special Defense EVs allow Arceus-Ground to survive one full-powered Eruption from Primal Groudon.</li> <li>192 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allows allow Arceus-Ground to outspeed Mega Lucario, Adamant Mega Salamence, and Mega Diancie.</li> <li>The rest of the EVs are placed into HP and Defense, so Arceus-Ground is able to deal with physical threats such as Swords Dance Primal Groudon, Swords Dance Necrozma-DM, and Mega Salamence as effectively as possible.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Avoid switching Arceus-Ground in too liberally against teams with Gothitelle until the opposing Stealth Rock setter has been removed from the battlefield, as Gothitelle can trap Arceus-Ground and eliminate it, thus allowing the opponent to either their keep entry hazards on the field or prevent Arceus-Ground from setting hazards for the remainder of the game.</li> <li>Try to use Toxic to deal with foes that tend to switch in on Arceus-Ground's attacks relatively easily such as Ho-Oh, Lugia, Buzzwole, Giratina-O, and Yveltal, as it wears all of them down and makes it easier for Arceus-Ground or another teammate to deal with them.</li> <li>Recover should be used whenever Arceus-Ground's health is running low. It can often be crucial for Arceus-Ground to use Recover in order for it to actually have a favorable matchup against a foe.

It also provides teams with a solid answer to Xerneas and Primal Kyogre's rain.</li> <li>Ho-Oh makes a brilliant partner for support Arceus-Ground, as it is able to threaten many of Arceus-Ground's checks such as Buzzwole, Celesteela, Skarmory, Chansey, and Blissey.</li> <li>Choice Scarf Yveltal pairs well with Arceus-Ground, as it is able to threaten Gothitelle and Mega Gengar, which can easily trap Arceus-Ground. Choice Scarf Yveltal also outspeeds Necrozma-DM and Ultra Necrozma and can revenge KO them both with Foul Play, which Arceus-Ground appreciates immensely, as Necrozma-DM takes little damage from Judgment thanks to its ability, Prism Armor, and Ultra Necrozma outspeeds Arceus-Ground and can dish out heavy damage to it with Light That Burns the Sky.</li> </ul> "

Substitute is especially useful against Zygarde-C and both Giratina formes, as it prevents Arceus-Ground from being forced out by Dragon Tail.</li> <li>Arceus-Ground doesn't appreciate status; Toxic poison wears it down rather quickly, preventing it from effectively sweeping; burns cut its Attack in half, removing its offensive presence almost entirely; and, although immune to Thunder Wave, it can still be paralyzed by Glare, which makes it easier to revenge kill. If Arceus-Ground is facing a bulkier team that relies on status in order to beat opposing Pokemon, make sure to keep clerics such as Xerneas alive as long as possible.</li> <li>Try to bring in Arceus-Ground by pivoting with U-turn from teammates such as Yveltal or by sacrificing a weakened teammate, as Swords Dance Arceus-Ground doesn't run any bulk and doesn't always run Recover, so it can be worn down rather easily.</li> <li>Although Arceus-Ground is meant to have a good matchup against Primal Groudon, it should be cautious when switching into Primal Groudon's attacks, as it is heavily worn down if it switches into a full-powered Overheat.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Arceus-Ground tends to prefer to be on offensive teams, as using this set removes the option of running a support Arceus forme, which are quite commonly found on more passive playstyles such as balance and stall.</li> <li>Entry hazard setters such as Deoxys-S, Shuckle, Cloyster, and Excadrill make brilliant partners, as entry hazards wear down just about every viable Pokemon in the tier that switches in, thus making it easier for Arceus-Ground to sweep. Shuckle is an especially useful partner, as Marshadow becomes slower than Arceus-Ground if Sticky Web is on Marshadow's side of the field, thus making it unable to revenge kill Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>Xerneas appreciates Arceus-Ground's ability to deal with Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Ho-Oh, making it easier for it to sweep. Choice Scarf Xerneas is an especially noteworthy partner,as it can cure Arceus-Ground from any status condition with Aromatherapy. Xerneas is also good for dealing with Marshadow, which Arceus-Ground dislikes dealing with because it can steal Arceus-Ground's boosts and knock it out with Spectral Thief.</li> <li>Ferrothorn can deal with Primal Kyogre and Arceus-Water, provide the team with a Toxic immunity, and set up Spikes, which punishes any grounded foe that switches in, making it easier for Arceus-Ground to sweep.</li> <li>Primal Groudon deals with Xerneas and can set Stealth Rock, punishing any Pokemon that switches in.</li> <li>Yveltal makes a good partner, as it threatens Marshadow and Mega Gengar, which Arceus-Ground tends to find rather threatening, since Marshadow can steal Arceus-Ground's boosts with Spectral Thief, and Mega Gengar can potentially trap Arceus-Ground and trade KOs with Destiny Bond. In return, Yveltal can switch in easily on Foul Play from opposing Yveltal and proceed to deal heavy damage with Oblivion Wing, and it can OHKO Mega Gengar with Dark Pulse. Sets with U-turn also make it easier to bring in Arceus-Ground, as it doesn't really appreciate taking unnecessary damage.</li> <li>Mega Gengar is a great partner for Arceus-Ground, as it is able to trap and remove Pokemon that wall Arceus-Ground, such as Lugia, support Arceus formes, and Celesteela.</li> </ul> "

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Arceus-Ice provides no defensive utility to any team due to its susceptibility to all entry hazards, weakness to Stealth Rock, and horrendous defensive typing offering no resistances other than Ice. This means getting Arceus-Ice in safely is a monumental challenge.</li> <li>Arceus-Ice has terrible matchups against a plethora of the top threats in the Ubers metagame such as Necrozma-DM, Marshadow, Magearna, offensive Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, Primal Kyogre, Mega Lucario, and Arceus-Water.</li> <li>Arceus-Ice cannot come out on top against stall teams thanks to Blissey and Chansey utilizing Confide to remove Special Attack boosts gained from Calm Mind, while Toxapex takes on Arceus-Ice variants that don't use Thunder to remove all of its boosts with Haze.</li> <li>While Arceus-Ice struggles defensively, it can perform decently well offensively thanks to its coverage being quite difficult to switch into for certain balance teams. Arceus-Ice sets itself apart from Kyurem-W thanks to its better Speed tier and defensive stats.</li> <li>Arceus-Ice performs well against Zygarde-C, special Arceus-Ground, Mega Salamence, Yveltal, Rayquaza, Lugia, Giratina-O, Arceus-Flying, and Ultra Necrozma before it sets up. Arceus-Ice is one of the only Pokemon in the tier that are capable of OHKOing any of Zygarde-C's sets with no offensive investment or stat boosts.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>A set with Icium Z and maximum Special Attack investment gives Arceus-Ice a one-time nuke option. +1 Subzero Slammer with either Ice Beam or Blizzard as the base move is capable of knocking out virtually any Primal Groudon set after Stealth Rock, and +1 Subzero Slammer followed by Ice Beam can take Ferrothorn out. However, this set is inconsistent, especially if Blizzard is used due to its poor accuracy, and Arceus-Ice will miss its Judgment and Icicle Plate after the Z-Move is used due to the noticeable drop in power.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh has the special bulk to withstand even boosted Thunders and either retaliate with Sacred Fire or stall Arceus-Ice out with Toxic, Recover, and Regenerator. If Arceus-Ice is running Fire Blast instead of Thunder, Ho-Oh is a hard counter. However, Ho-Oh is pressured by Stealth Rock, which undermines its ability to switch into Arceus-Ice's attacks, especially when they're boosted by Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Chansey</strong>: Both Blissey and Chansey take very little damage from anything Arceus-Ice can throw at them and nullify its Calm Mind boosts with Confide. They can proceed to stall it out with Toxic shortly after.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Necrozma-DM, Magearna, and Mega Scizor comfortably come in on Arceus-Ice's STAB Judgment and Thunder, but they must watch out for Fire Blast on the switch. Keep in mind that support Necrozma-DM is only 3HKOed by +1 Fire Blast and can 2HKO back with Sunsteel Strike.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Life Orb variants of Marshadow OHKO Arceus-Ice with Close Combat after a small amount of prior damage. Marshadium Z variants can survive +1 Judgment from full HP to set up with Bulk Up and OHKO with +1 Close Combat the following turn. Mega Lucario can only switch into Judgment and Thunder once and has to fear Fire Blast, but in a one-on-one situation against non-Fire Blast Arceus-Ice, Mega Lucario can survive any one hit and OHKO back with Close Combat. If Arceus-Ice is weakened enough, Mega Lucario's Bullet Punch can pick it off. Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Blaziken can survive any hits from Arceus-Ice and retaliate with Low Kick.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon: Primal Groudon sets that run Fire-type STAB moves heavily pressure Arceus-Ice. Primal Groudon's uninvested Overheat, maximum Special Attack Fire Blast, and maximum Attack Fire Punch OHKO unboosted Arceus-Ice from full health. However, offensive Primal Groudon sets are 2HKOed by Judgment after Stealth Rock, so it should be wary of attempting to switch in.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards</strong>: Arceus-Ice is susceptible to being whittled down by all forms of entry hazards, and keeping them up on Arceus-Ice's side of the field throughout the match is a great way to keep it at bay. Having Stealth Rock up also allows powerful neutral hits such as Ultra Necrozma's Light That Burns The Sky, Mega Salamence's +1 Double-Edge, and Zygarde-C's +1 Tectonic Rage to knock Arceus-Ice out.</p> <p><strong>Swords Dance Arceus formes: Swords Dance variants of Arceus, Arceus-Ghost, and even Arceus-Ground overpower Arceus-Ice with their boosted attacks. Arceus-Ghost's +2 Never-Ending Nightmare and Arceus-Ground's +2 Tectonic Rage OHKO Arceus-Ice from full HP, while Arceus's +2 Extreme Speed 2HKOes from full health.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: If Arceus-Ice lacks Thunder, Water-types such as Toxapex, Arceus-Water, and Primal Kyogre counter it. Toxapex removes stat boosts with Haze and can set Toxic Spikes to whittle down Arceus-Ice as it comes in, while Arceus-Water and defensive Primal Kyogre stall it out with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Tyranitar, Mega Tyranitar, and Arceus-Rock hit Arceus-Ice hard with their STAB Rock-type attacks. Choice Band Tyranitar stomachs a +1 Judgment and OHKOes back with Stone Edge after sand damage, while Mega Tyranitar renders Arceus-Ice setup fodder. Arceus-Rock wins the Calm Mind war against Arceus-Ice.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Calm Mind boosts Arceus-Ice's Special Attack and Special Defense, bolstering its offensive and defensive capabilities.</li> <li>Recover is mandatory on this set, as it allows Arceus-Ice to regenerate the health that it loses after stomaching weaker hits and entry hazards.</li> <li>Judgment is the STAB move of choice, being able to OHKO Zygarde-C, Mega Salamence, and Rayquaza while OHKOing Ultra Necrozma after Stealth Rock, even without boosts. An unboosted Judgment is also capable of 3HKOing support Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Thunder provides excellent BoltBeam coverage alongside Judgment and enables Arceus-Ice to effectively deal with Ho-Oh, Primal Kyogre, Arceus-Water, and Toxapex.</li> <li>Fire Blast can be used over Thunder to give Arceus-Ice a move to hit Steel-types such as Necrozma-DM, Magearna, Mega Lucario, and Mega Scizor super effectively.</li> <li>Refresh can be used in the fourth slot to allow Arceus-Ice to act as a status sponge against defensive teams while performing well against teams setting up for a Dragon Dance Zygarde-C sweep via Toxic Spikes and paralysis. However, this severely hurts Arceus-Ice's coverage.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>252 Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Arceus-Ice to Speed tie with other Arceus formes and Mega Salamence and outspeed Mega Lucario, Yveltal, Rayquaza, and everything slower.</li> <li>84 Special Attack EVs increase Arceus-Ice's chance to 2HKO most offensive Primal Groudon sets with an unboosted Judgment and give it the ability to OHKO Ultra Necrozma from full HP.</li> <li>The rest of the EVs go into HP to increase Arceus-Ice's bulk, which allows it to survive Arceus-Ground's +2 Stone Edge, Zygarde-C's +1 Tectonic Rage, and Adamant Mega Salamence's +1 Double-Edge.</li> <li>Alternatively, a set with maximum Special Attack investment can be considered, as it provides Arceus-Ice the ability to OHKO defensive Ho-Oh with +1 Thunder after Stealth Rock and a small chance to OHKO offensive Primal Groudon with +1 Judgment after Stealth Rock. However, this severely undermines Arceus-Ice's bulk.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Arceus-Ice's subpar defensive typing means it doesn't have many opportunities to safely switch in. Switch it into weak neutral attacks such as Judgment from support Arceus formes and Earthquake from physical Giratina-O.</li> <li>Don't bother setting up with Calm Mind while Arceus-Ice's checks are still active and healthy. It's best to wait until its checks are weakened enough for a sweep to be successful. Until then, simply double switch to its teammates to gain momentum when going up against hard checks like Ho-Oh or simply attack to start whittling down checks that don't have reliable recovery such as offensive Necrozma-DM and offensive Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>While Arceus-Ice can check special variants of Arceus-Ground, physical sets prove to be tricky when it comes down to Speed ties, as they typically run maximum Speed as well. Arceus-Ground is capable of surviving one unboosted Judgment to set up Swords Dance and OHKO Arceus-Ice back with +2 Tectonic Rage if it happens to win the Speed tie on the second turn. With this in mind, it's best to scout the opposing Arceus-Ground's set before sending Arceus-Ice out.</li> <li>Try to keep entry hazards off the field as much as possible before Arceus-Ice comes in, as Stealth Rock will put it in range of a lot of powerful attacks. For instance, physical Ultra Necrozma's unboosted Light That Burns the Sky OHKOes Arceus-Ice after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>If Arceus-Ice is running Thunder, it should be used as Arceus-Water, Primal Kyogre, and Toxapex switch in, while Fire Blast variants can take chunks out of incoming Necrozma-DM, Magearna, and Mega Scizor.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Entry hazard removal is mandatory to prevent Arceus-Ice from taking unnecessary damage , especially from Stealth Rock. Defog users such as Giratina-O and Xerneas are excellent options, as they're not weak to Stealth Rock and can deal with a few of Arceus-Ice's checks. Giratina-O checks Necrozma-DM and Mega Lucario, while bulky and Choice Scarf Xerneas sets deal with Marshadow.</li> <li>Arceus-Ice appreciates checks to Ho-Oh such as Zygarde-C, Primal Groudon, and Mega Diancie. Zygarde-C is noteworthy, since it takes on many of Arceus-Ice's other major checks, including Necrozma-DM, non-Hidden Power Ice Marshadow, Mega Lucario, and offensive Primal Groudon. Primal Groudon can either offer Stealth Rock support, which heavily punishes Ho-Oh each time it comes in, or run Rock-type coverage to OHKO it for Arceus-Ice. Mega Diancie can also provide Stealth Rock and act as emergency anti-hazard support thanks to Magic Bounce. In return, Arceus-Ice checks special Arceus-Ground, which threatens all three of these potential partners.</li> <li>Checks to Steel-type Pokemon, such as Primal Groudon, Zygarde-C, Mega Lucario, Marshadow, and Primal Kyogre, are beneficial to Arceus-Ice, as this means it won't have to rely on Fire Blast to get past them. Mega Lucario and non-Hidden Power Ice Marshadow, in particular, appreciate Arceus-Ice's ability to get past Zygarde-C and special Arceus-Ground. These partners are also capable of dealing with Rock-type checks to Arceus-Ice such as Tyranitar and Arceus-Rock.</li> <li>Stallbreakers such as Mega Gengar, Gothitelle, and Mega Gyarados are excellent partners due to Arceus-Ice's poor matchup against some of stall's staples such as Blissey and Chansey.</li> <li>If Arceus-Ice is not running Thunder, checks to Water-types such as Primal Kyogre and Arceus-Water are mandatory. Ferrothorn, Primal Groudon, and Mega Venusaur fill this role.</li> <li>Since getting Arceus-Ice in safely can be a daunting task, Pokemon that use Volt Switch such as Magearna and Zekrom and U-turn such as Yveltal, Mega Scizor, and Tapu Koko are extremely helpful. Zekrom and Tapu Koko are able to check Ho-Oh, Primal Kyogre, and Arceus-Water. Meanwhile, Yveltal checks Necrozma-DM.</li> </ul> "

  "Arceus-Poison": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Arceus-Poison's typing allows it to serve as a check to Xerneas and Marshadow in a single option, giving it a small niche for some balance and bulky offense teams. It has the capability to handle many other Fairy- and Fighting-types in Ubers as well.</li> <li>Arceus-Poison has the benefit of a Toxic immunity, making a Calm Mind set an attractive idea and adding utility as a good switch-in to Pokemon reliant on Toxic damage to check threats or handle bulky targets.</li> <li>However, the synergies between Arceus-Poison and many potential partners in Ubers such as Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM can be weak, leaving teams that use it scrambling to compensate for a weakness to common Ground-type threats such as Primal Groudon, Zygarde-C, and Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>A major downside to Arceus-Poison is that it will always lack coverage against an important threat, making it ineffective against various Ghost-, Ground-, or Steel-types based on the coverage option it chooses. It is also likely to have have trouble with various Pokemon regardless due to a lack of immediate power.</li> <li>The trade-off for using Arceus-Poison over a different Arceus forme is generally a net loss due to the aforementioned traits. It ultimately relies on getting a good matchup to be effective or having a team built around it to cover the Pokemon it cannot effectively damage due to a lack of coverage, which are severe detriments for a Calm Mind Arceus forme.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>A Swords Dance set with Earthquake, Poison Jab, and Extreme Speed or Recover is a potential alternative, but it exchanges bulk for offense, which makes Arceus-Poison less of a reliable answer to Fairy-types and Marshadow.</li> <li>Thunder is a potential alternative coverage option that hits Primal Kyogre, Ho-Oh, Skarmory, Celesteela, and Toxapex in one moveslot. This leads to Arceus-Poison being very helpless against Ground-type Pokemon, however.</li> <li>Will-O-Wisp can prevent many Ground- and Steel-type setup sweepers from taking too much advantage of Arceus-Poison, but it can't fit into Arceus-Poison's moveset very well.</li> <li>A Stealth Rock support set can be considered, as Arceus-Poison's Toxic immunity can help it maintain longevity against Defog users. However, it has a hard time setting Stealth Rock against the likes of Mega Sableye and Defog Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>Toxic from Arceus-Poison has the neat trick of never missing and can limit many switch-ins, but it is difficult to fit.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Primal Groudon, Zygarde-C, and Arceus-Ground are the biggest threats to Arceus-Poison due to their superior offensive matchup. They are able to switch into any of Arceus-Poison's moves at least once and immediately force it out with strong Ground-type STAB attacks or setup moves. Arceus-Poison can catch Primal Groudon switching in with Earth Power and try to get a Sludge Bomb poison against Zygarde-C and Arceus-Ground, but that's all that most standard sets can really do in return.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Nearly every Steel-type in the tier besides Mega Lucario is able to freely switch into Arceus-Poison at least once and set up or set entry hazards. Skarmory and Celesteela stand out especially, as Arceus-Poison sets lacking Fire Blast have no way to properly damage them.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Lunala, Giratina, Mega Gengar, Giratina-O, Arceus-Ghost, and even Bulk Up Marshadow are all threats to Arceus-Poison due to their resistances and bulk making it easy for them to switch in. Mega Gengar has to be careful around Earth Power variants and Marshadow sets lacking Bulk Up can be walled, but otherwise all these Ghost-types can be difficult matchups for Arceus-Poison.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Ultra Necrozma, Deoxys-A, and various Mewtwo sets are all capable of outspeeding Arceus-Poison and threatening it with near or complete OHKOes with their STAB attacks should it stay in.</p> <p><strong>Toxapex: Toxapex is capable of annoying Arceus-Poison sets that lack Earth Power by removing its Calm Mind boosts with Haze.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Attackers</strong>: Primal Kyogre, offensive Ho-Oh, and Mega Salamence are all capable of taking most hits from Arceus-Poison and retaliating with higher damage output, likely forcing it out.</p> ",

This investment also avoids the 2HKO from Marshadow's Spectral Thief after Stealth Rock damage, making Arceus-Poison a good check to it.</li> <li>Maximum Speed EVs and a Timid nature ensure that Arceus-Poison Speed ties, at worst, with opposing Arceus formes and Mega Salamence. This can help with the matchup against many offensive Arceus formes and Jolly Mega Salamence, which may have Earthquake, making a Speed tie better than nothing.</li> <li>Toxic Plate is used over Poisonium Z for a consistent Sludge Bomb damage boost. There are generally too many resistances to Acid Downpour in Ubers to make it a good option.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Arceus-Poison's main targets are Xerneas and Marshadow, but it can be used to get damage on a slower target such as Yveltal if the situation calls for it. Bulk Up Marshadow sets should be watched out for, as they will break Arceus-Poison very easily.</li> <li>Arceus-Poison has many common switch-ins, and all of them can be very deadly to or just hard wall Arceus-Poison. Try to limit the amount of room given to dangerous Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM with Arceus-Poison's coverage options or entry hazard damage and be ready to switch it out if need be.</li> <li>Coverage is the biggest indicator that determines how to use Arceus-Poison. By using Earth Power, it is completely walled by Skarmory and Celesteela and should avoid them entirely. By using Fire Blast, Arceus-Poison can only aim for chip damage or a poison against Primal Groudon with Sludge Bomb.</li> <li>Ghost-types such as Lunala, Mega Gengar, and Giratina-O and Ground-types such as Zygarde-C and Arceus-Ground are not worth taking on without a specialized coverage move in Ice Beam. Even with this move, the matchup against some of the aforementioned Pokemon doesn't improve. The big thing to note is that Arceus-Poison invites a lot of dangerous Pokemon in and lacks sufficient counterplay against them, so be very wary about how you use it.</li> <li>Arceus-Poison can be switched into Xerneas with impunity as long as it is kept healthy over repeated switches in. Choice Scarf Xerneas poses very little threat, but Geomancy Xerneas can break a weakened Arceus-Poison. Against Geomancy Xerneas, it is important to use Calm Mind against it if Arceus-Poison switches in on the turn Geomancy is used and begin to Recover off the damage from an incoming Moonblast or coverage option. Once enough Calm Mind boosts are accumulated, Arceus-Poison should be able to fight back and overpower a boosted Xerneas, but luck is likely to play a part in this matchup due to Moonblast's potential Special Attack drops and Arceus-Poison's need to act defensively.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Arceus-Poison absolutely needs its teammates to cover for its many defensive flaws. Some form of offense will be needed to make up for the holes that trying to fit Arceus-Poison into a team will inevitably bring, so overly defensive teams are far better off using a better suited Arceus forme.</li> <li>Checks to Primal Groudon and other Ground-types are a requirement. Mega Salamence, Giratina-O, Celesteela, and Skarmory are all possible options based on the overall team structure and needs of other teammates.</li> <li>Arceus-Ground can be handled by Celesteela, Primal Kyogre, and Ho-Oh, but this depends on what variant of Arceus-Ground the team needs to cover. Celesteela can generally cover all variants.</li> <li>Zygarde-C is a difficult foe to overcome when using Arceus-Poison. Xerneas offers a good revenge killing method with its Choice Scarf set, but Primal Kyogre and Lugia are alternative ideas depending on the team.</li> <li>Primal Kyogre acts as a threatening wallbreaker against most Steel-types that bother Arceus-Poison and further assists against most Primal Groudon variants.</li> <li>Yveltal offers a Ground immunity and can also function as a revenge killer or check to the various Ghost- and Psychic-types that will easily break through Arceus-Poison. Wallbreaker variants of Yveltal have excellent pressure against enemy Steel-types as well.</li> <li>Primal Groudon is an effective teammate that can set Stealth Rock and provide pressure against Ho-Oh and the various Steel-types that threaten Arceus-Poison. Special variants of Primal Groudon threaten Skarmory and Celesteela but will give Ho-Oh more room than usual.</li> <li>Ultra Necrozma can offer a soft check to mixed Primal Groudon variants and an offensive check to slower threats such as Arceus-Ground while not adding too much of a Ground-type weakness to the build once Necrozma-DM can Ultra Burst.</li> <li>Gothitelle is a potential teammate to trap and eliminate the defensive Steel-types that would otherwise wall Arceus-Poison.</li> </ul> "

This makes it struggle as a general-purpose wall compared to its competition, as other Arceus formes such as Arceus-Water and Arceus-Ground have less relevant weaknesses and cover a similar niche.

Most Pokemon beat Arceus-Psychic easily within three turns, but those hoping to stall it out with Toxic such as Arceus-Water and Necrozma-DM could actually lose to this.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types are immune to Judgment and threaten Arceus-Psychic with super effective STAB moves, making them serve as hard checks. Probably the best counter to Arceus-Psychic is Calm Mind Arceus-Dark, which can boost on it safely, heals off status with Refresh, and has a powerful super effective STAB move; non-Calm Mind variants also win easily, as their Judgment 2HKOes Arceus-Psychic. Yveltal is immune to Arceus-Psychic's Judgment, at worst 2HKOes with Dark Pulse, and isn't bothered by Will-O-Wisp, making it a solid counter.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Marshadow and Mega Gengar are both capable of outspeeding and revenge killing Arceus-Psychic with their devastating STAB moves, although neither will OHKO and both get OHKOed in return, so Arceus-Psychic can deter these Pokemon by avoiding chip damage. Lunala, Arceus-Ghost, and Giratina-O check Arceus-Psychic by threatening it with super effective STAB moves and mostly fear taking Toxic in return. Giratina will easily Toxic stall Arceus-Psychic and can heal its own status with Rest.</p> <p><strong>Gothitelle: Gothitelle can switch into any of Arceus-Psychic's sets, PP stall it, and eliminate it with no risk, severely undermining its utility as a defensive Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers</strong>: Due to Arceus-Psychic's passive nature, wallbreakers such as Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Choice Band Ho-Oh, and (if lacking Ice Beam) Rayquaza should be able to break through Arceus-Psychic by outdamaging its attacks and recovery. Setup sweepers such as Xerneas can similarly exploit it for setup.</p> <p><strong>Status Spreaders: Pokemon that can spread Toxic, such as support Arceus formes, defensive Necrozma-DM, Lugia, defensive Ho-Oh sets, Giratina, and other passive Pokemon should be able to shrug off hits from Arceus-Psychic and Toxic stall it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Necrozma-DM has little to fear from Arceus-Psychic except Will-O-Wisp, and while burning Necrozma-DM is a very effective punish option, both offensive and defensive sets still check Arceus-Psychic when burned. Celesteela, Magearna, Skarmory, and the rest of the tier's Steel-types resist Psychic moves and are immune to Toxic, allowing them to completely wall it with little risk and set up on or Toxic stall it.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Judgment is a reliable Psychic-type STAB move that allows Arceus-Psychic to hit Poison- and Fighting-types super effectively, notably achieving OHKOs against Mega Gengar, Marshadow, Blaziken, and Naganadel as well as reliably 2HKOing Toxapex. It also does meaningful chip damage to switch-ins that do not resist it, most notably including Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Will-O-Wisp provides Arceus-Psychic with a way to punish physical attackers that may try to take advantage of its passivity to set up on it by burning them and halving their attack. Necrozma-DM in particular is severely debilitated by a burn and would otherwise easily take advantage of Arceus-Psychic with its 4x resistance to Judgment, and Ultra Necrozma is weakened by it enough to keep its damage output manageable as Arceus-Psychic chips at it.</li> <li>Recover is the mandatory healing move, keeping Arceus-Psychic healthy to take hits throughout the match.</li> <li>Ice Beam allows Arceus-Psychic to punish Dragon-type sweepers that may take advantage of its passive nature to set up, notably OHKOing Mega Salamence, 2HKOing Zygarde-C, and 2HKOing Ultra Necrozma after burn or Stealth Rock damage.</li> <li>Toxic can be used as a way to threaten passive special attackers, such as support Arceus formes that do not fear a burn and can heal off chip damage from Judgment.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Full investment in HP increases Arceus-Psychic's bulk, allowing it to sponge hits and provide team support throughout the match.</li> <li>Full Speed investment allows Arceus-Psychic to at worst Speed tie with other base 120 Speed Pokemon, allowing it to threaten Arceus-Ground with a burn before it can use Substitute and Mega Salamence with Ice Beam before it can attack.</li> <li>An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 64 SpD / 192 Spe allows Arceus-Psychic to better take hits from the Psychic-types it is meant to check, notably allowing it to switch into Psychic from Deoxys-A and still tank a Dark Pulse before OHKOing. The Speed investment is still enough to outspeed Mega Lucario and threaten it with Will-O-Wisp and Judgment.</li> <li>Multitype is Arceus's mandatory ability and combines with Mind Plate to form Arceus-Psychic and provide it with a reliable STAB move in Judgment.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Arceus-Psychic should be liberally switched into the Pokemon it is meant to check, especially Psychic-types such as Ultra Necrozma, Mewtwo formes and Deoxys-A, as its bulk and recovery allow it to sponge their otherwise threatening hits throughout the match. However, be careful when facing a boosted Ultra Necrozma, as its Light That Burns the Sky has a chance to OHKO after Stealth Rock at +2. Prevent this situation by seeking to burn Ultra Necrozma before it transforms or relying on Dark-types to take that Z-Move.</li> <li>Note that despite their powerful super effective STAB moves and higher Speed, neither Marshadow nor Mega Gengar is capable of OHKOing Arceus-Psychic from full HP even after Stealth Rock, while Arceus-Psychic does OHKO with Judgment, so keep Arceus-Psychic healthy allows it to be used as a check against these in a pinch. At the same time, be careful to avoid being trapped by Mega Gengar if Arceus-Psychic falls into KO range of Hex or Shadow Ball.</li> <li>After Arceus-Psychic is brought in against a Pokemon it checks, your opponent will most likely switch to either an attacker that can set up on Arceus-Psychic or a passive special attacker that can easily wall it; try to predict these switches and punish them with Will-O-Wisp, Toxic, or a double switch as appropriate.</li> <li>Try to avoid status, especially poison, as it will severely limit Arceus-Psychic's ability to sponge hits. Trading Toxic with other passive Pokemon may be worth it if the opponent lacks a way to remove it, especially given Arceus-Psychic's matchup-reliance, but avoid doing this if facing Arceus-Psychic's ideal matchup against Psychic Terrain teams.</li> <li>If running other Pokemon with Toxic, be careful clicking Will-O-Wisp when anticipating switches. Passive Pokemon such as Arceus-Water, which often switch into Arceus-Psychic, can actually benefit from being burned, as they do not mind the Attack drop and become immune to Toxic.</li> <li>Arceus-Psychic lacks a way to meaningfully damage passive Pokemon capable of recovering or blocking status, notably including Mega Sableye, Blissey, and Chansey. If the opponent has such a Pokemon, Arceus-Psychic will be borderline useless, as the opponent can just switch to them with no penalty whenever Arceus-Psychic is sent out. Unless trying to bait a switch to these Pokemon, such as by double-switching, simply do not send out Arceus-Psychic at all in this matchup, as that way it can at least pressure the opponent by threatening to be a sweeping Arceus forme.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Arceus-Psychic is meant to protect a team from Psychic Terrain and Psychic-type attackers, so teams that need an answer to these threats but cannot afford the Fighting-type weakness of Arceus-Dark may consider Arceus-Psychic.</li> <li>Arceus-Psychic's passivity allows sweepers to take advantage of it and set up, so a Pokemon that can patch up these weaknesses, such as Marshadow, Choice Scarf Xerneas, or Choice Scarf Yveltal, would make a good partner.</li> <li>Arceus-Psychic is easily exploited by Dark-types, so a Fairy-type that can switch into attacks from especially Yveltal would be helpful. Magearna stands out as the Pokemon most capable of hard switching into Dark-types repeatedly, and bulkier or Choice Xerneas sets can also perform this role effectively.</li> <li>Similarly, Arceus-Psychic appreciates a good switch-in to Ghost-type attacks that could hit it super effectively. Yveltal is a good partner in this regard, threatening the tier's Ghost-types with an OHKO and having enough bulk to comfortably take a few resisted attacks even from powerful attackers such as Marshadow and Mega Gengar.</li> <li>Because Arceus-Psychic is so passive, the main way to punish the opponent for offensive plays, especially if lacking dual status, is to run a wallbreaker that can be used to double switch into. Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and Choice Specs Xerneas and Yveltal are examples of wallbreakers that can be devastating given good prediction.</li> <li>Hex Mega Gengar is a very good partner for dual status Arceus-Psychic, as it greatly appreciates Arceus-Psychic's ability to spread status while implicitly magnifying Arceus-Psychic's offensive presence by threatening to hit statused targets with boosted Hex.</li> </ul> "

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Arceus-Rock's typing and decent bulk allow it to fulfill a unique defensive niche as a blanket check to the tier's many Flying-type Pokemon. It is perhaps the tier's best answer to Ho-Oh and Mega Salamence due to its typing and excellent Speed, and it can be a solid check to Rayquaza and Yveltal.</li> <li>STAB Judgment has solid neutral coverage, and nothing is immune to it, which gives Arceus-Rock some offensive presence.</li> <li>Access to Will-O-Wisp allows Arceus-Rock to punish physical attackers that threaten it, including Mega Lucario, Necrozma-DM, and Arceus-Ground, although the catastrophic damage they inflict forces you to use this move either on a prediction or a sacrifice.</li> <li>A good matchup against offensive Defog users, such as Ho-Oh, Mega Salamence, and Yveltal, allows Arceus-Rock to serve as a solid user of Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Weaknesses to Steel-, Fighting-, Ground-, and Water-type moves allow most of the tier's most prominent attackers to threaten OHKOs, such as Necrozma-DM, Marshadow, Mega Lucario, Arceus-Ground, Primal Groudon, and Primal Kyogre, making Arceus-Rock largely unsuccessful at providing the general-use bulk usually sought in support and Calm Mind Arceus formes.</li> <li>Arceus-Rock is also vulnerable to being trapped by Gothitelle, which renders you unable to set up Stealth Rock with it without risking sacrificing it and possibly conceding the entry hazard war to the opposing team.</li> <li>Arceus-Rock's viability is badly strained by its competition. Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Fairy do a better job of keeping Stealth Rock up, Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Fairy, and Arceus-Dark are better Calm Mind users due to their better defensive typings, and Arceus-Water does a better job as a damage sponge, so Arceus-Rock is only viable in teams that particularly need those roles in a check to Flying-types.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Arceus-Rock is not viable without Recover, Judgment, and Will-O-Wisp, as this allows foes to exploit its severe weaknesses, but it can replace Stealth Rock to provide different forms of utility for its team.</li> <li>Calm Mind can be used to make Arceus-Rock into a sweeper. Calm Mind Arceus-Rock struggles to set up early-game, as its many prominent answers, especially its Steel-type counters, can easily put a stop to a sweep and set up in return, so it should focus on spreading status, sponging resisted hits, and potentially bluffing a support set early-game. However, Arceus-Rock can be fairly threatening late-game once its checks are worn down, especially because it outspeeds most of them, so it provides solid role compression for bulky offense teams. It particularly makes a good partner for Choice Specs Yveltal, which severely pressures common switch-ins such as Magearna, which Arceus-Rock can proceed to break through.</li> <li>Toxic can be run as a second status move that allows Arceus-Rock to punish passive Pokemon that can wall Judgment and do not mind or even enjoy being burned, such as support Arceus formes, which otherwise have nothing to fear from Arceus-Rock. Dual status Arceus-Rock functions well as a dedicated damage sponge and support option that can meaningfully punish all of its switch-ins with good prediction, but it loses out on the ability to fill a bigger role for the team. Notably, it is an excellent partner for Hex Mega Gengar, as it can spread status to any Pokemon in the tier, making it easier for Mega Gengar to revenge kill.</li> <li>Fire Blast can be ran in place of Will-O-Wisp as a way to chip at Steel-types such as Necrozma-DM and Magearna while allowing Arceus-Rock to hit Celesteela, Skarmory, and especially Ferrothorn harder than its other options. However, other Pokemon kept in check by Will-O-Wisp, notably Zygarde-C, are left with nothing stopping them from setting up on Arceus-Rock.</li> <li>Roar can be used to phaze setup sweepers and, if not running Calm Mind, break out of Gothitelle's trapping. However, this is not that common of a matchup, so Will-O-Wisp, Stealth Rock, Toxic, and Calm Mind provide much more general utility.</li> <li>Refresh + Calm Mind can make a full mono-attacking sweeping set, but the Pokemon kept in check by Will-O-Wisp such as Marshadow, Necrozma-DM, Magearna, and Mega Lucario will shut down this set with ease and often set up for a sweep of their own.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Arceus-Rock's most effective checks are Ground-types that resist Judgment, threaten it with super effective moves, and typically have a way of managing Will-O-Wisp. Arceus-Ground can scare out Arceus-Rock fairly easily with STAB Ground-type attacks. Special sets do not mind Will-O-Wisp, and physical sets often carry Substitute to manage the threat of Will-O-Wisp. Zygarde-C can easily tank Judgment, hit Arceus-Rock with Thousand Arrows, and guard Will-O-Wisp with Substitute or Rest depending on the set. Primal Groudon is the most prominent Pokemon in the metagame and hard checks Arceus-Rock while being immune to Will-O-Wisp, although it will take notable damage from Judgment on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Necrozma-DM threatens Arceus-Rock with super effective Sunsteel Strike and can use scaring it out as an opportunity to boost for a sweep or set Stealth Rock, although it is severely impaired by Will-O-Wisp. Magearna easily walls Arceus-Rock's Judgment, is immune to Toxic, and is relatively unfazed by Will-O-Wisp, so it can confidently wall Arceus-Rock. Ferrothorn gets free turns from Arceus-Rock and can use them to set up entry hazards or hit it with super effective STAB moves. Less common Steel-types such as Arceus-Steel, Aegislash, and Mega Metagross also threaten Arceus-Rock with super effective STAB moves and can switch in without much trouble, although Mega Metagross seriously dislikes being burned.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Marshadow easily manages Arceus-Rock by outspeeding it and threatening to OHKO with Close Combat or steal Calm Mind boosts with Spectral Thief. Mega Lucario will also OHKO with relative ease and can scare out Arceus-Rock for an opportunity to set up Swords Dance and sweep. Both of these Pokemon, however, are severely hampered by Will-O-Wisp on the switch.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: Primal Kyogre is a major threat to teams running Arceus-Rock, as it takes relatively little damage from Judgment, is functionally immune to Will-O-Wisp, threatens an OHKO with its devastating STAB moves, and is very difficult to switch into, so it should be played around with particular caution.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Blissey and Chansey can easily wall Arceus-Rock, absorb burns, and scare it out with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Gothitelle: If Arceus-Rock is not running Calm Mind or Roar, Gothitelle can switch into any of its moves, trap it with Shadow Tag, and PP stall it to death.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Though rare, Grass-type attackers such as Shaymin-S and Arceus-Grass can OHKO or 2HKO Arceus-Rock with super effective STAB moves. Ferrothorn also easily walls Arceus-Rock and can use the free turns to set up entry hazards or chip away at it.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Arceus-Water can spread Toxic to cripple Arceus-Rock and takes manageable damage from Judgment. Toxapex can also wall Arceus-Rock with relative ease and set up Toxic Spikes. Palkia can threaten Arceus-Rock with super effective moves and reliably set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Fast revenge killers such as Mega Gengar, Pheromosa, Deoxys-A, Mega Mewtwo Y, Mega Mewtwo X, and Lunala commonly carry super effective Fighting-type moves that will easily take out a weakened Arceus-Rock.</p> <p><strong>Status Spreaders: Being hit by Toxic will put Arceus-Rock on a timer, preventing it from keeping up Stealth Rock or setting up for a sweep. Similarly, paralysis will lower its Speed and also threaten it to be overwhelmed by the attacks it is supposed to switch into if it misses Recover turns. Because of this, Arceus-Rock is usually forced out by status spreaders such as support Arceus formes, and it even is hesitant to switch into some of its usual targets, such as Ho-Oh, if they could potentially spread status onto it.</p> ",

Arceus-Rock's good matchup against offensive Defoggers such as Ho-Oh, Mega Salamence, and Yveltal allows it to keep Stealth Rock up rather well against offensive teams, but it struggles to keep the hazard up in the face of bulky, status-spreading Defog users such as support Arceus formes.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Full investment in HP increases Arceus-Rock's bulk, allowing it to sponge hits and provide team support throughout the match.</li> <li>16 Defense EVs allow Arceus-Rock to survive a boosted Earthquake from Dragon Dance Mega Salamence after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>144 Special Attack EVs make Judgment 2HKO physically defensive Mega Sableye so it cannot prevent Stealth Rock from being set.</li> <li>The Speed investment allows Arceus-Rock to outspeed anything up to positive-natured base 100s, which notably includes non-Choice Scarf Xerneas and Yveltal, Primal Groudon, Rayquaza, and Zygarde-C, as well as uncommon attackers such as Kyurem-W and Palkia.</li> <li>An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 64 Def / 192 Spe allows Arceus-Rock to outspeed Mega Lucario to potentially stop a sweep with Will-O-Wisp by sacrificing itself. Running at least 40 Defense EVs further allows it to take a boosted Earthquake from both Dragon Dance Rayquaza and Mega Salamence after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Alternatively, full Speed investment allows Arceus-Rock to Speed tie with positive-natured base 120s such as Mega Salamence and offensive Arceus sets, which is useful for spreading burns.</li> <li>Multitype combines with Rock Plate to form Arceus-Rock and provide a reliable STAB move in Judgment.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Arceus-Rock should be liberally switched into Flying-types such as Mega Salamence, Ho-Oh, and Rayquaza and threaten them with an OHKO.</li> <li>Watch out for Ground-type coverage on Pokemon Arceus-Rock can usually handle, especially after you've revealed Arceus-Rock, as it will force a Recover and cost the momentum you would have gained.</li> <li>Unless your opponent is running a Defogger that can directly switch into Arceus-Rock, such as Arceus-Water, the first priority for Arceus-Rock should be to set Stealth Rock when given a free turn.</li> <li>Try to anticipate your opponent switching into physical attackers such as Necrozma-DM, Marshadow, Zygarde-C, Mega Lucario, and Primal Groudon. In the case of the first four, punishing them with Will-O-Wisp on the switch will allow your teammates to handle their weakened attacks relatively easily.</li> <li>If a bulky offense team is left with no other answers against a potential sweep, Arceus-Rock can be sacrificed to burn a physical attacker such as Arceus-Ground or Necrozma-DM. Outside of these scenarios, Will-O-Wisp should only ever be used on predicted switches, as Arceus-Rock is easily OHKOed by physical threats and cannot stand up to them even if burned.</li> <li>Play Arceus-Rock conservatively against other Pokemon if your opponent has healthy Flying-type threats, especially given that it is only viable in teams that are otherwise badly weak to them.</li> <li>Avoid being hit with Toxic and Glare, as they significantly limit Arceus-Rock's usefulness as a sponge and sweeper. On the other hand, being burned does not really annoy Arceus-Rock much and could even be beneficial, as it prevents Arceus-Rock from being inflicted by more annoying status, so switch into burning moves such as Sacred Fire and Will-O-Wisp if given the opportunity.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Arceus-Rock should only be run to cover a severe weakness to Flying-types, especially Ho-Oh, so Pokemon that have these weaknesses such as Necrozma-DM, Primal Groudon, Magearna, Xerneas, and Ferrothorn, among several others, appreciate its support.</li> <li>Because Arceus-Rock runs Stealth Rock, it can free up Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM, the tier's more common setters, to run more offensive sets.</li> <li>Arceus-Rock is fairly durable for a Stealth Rock setter, so pairing it with a Defog user such as Giratina-O or Mega Salamence allows your team to try to be the only side with entry hazards up late-game. However, do not use a Defogger that is easily trapped by Gothitelle along with Arceus-Rock, as if both are kept out of the field by Gothitelle, the opponent will easily dominate the entry hazard war and set the pace of the match.</li> <li>Mega Gengar and Gothitelle make for good partners, as they can remove Defoggers and some Stealth Rock setters, allowing Arceus-Rock to dominate the entry hazard war for late-game. Both of these Pokemon also enjoy having their possible targets burned by Arceus-Rock, allowing Hex Mega Gengar to revenge kill far more easily and Gothitelle to manage even strong physical attackers such as Necrozma-DM with confidence.</li> <li>Zygarde-C and Yveltal are good partners, as they can switch into and revenge kill Fighting- and Steel-types that check Arceus-Rock.</li> <li>Primal Groudon is an excellent partner, since it can handle many of Arceus-Rock's prominent checks, such as Primal Kyogre, Blissey, Magearna, and Necrozma-DM. Primal Kyogre in particular can take advantage of Arceus-Rock, as it threatens it super effectively, takes little damage from Judgment, and threatens an OHKO with its powerful STAB Water-type attacks, making Primal Groudon a near-necessity as a partner.</li> <li>Giratina-O is another notable partner for Arceus-Rock, as it checks major threats to Arceus-Rock such as Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground, provides Defog support that works well with Arceus-Rock, and fits well on the bulky offense teams that typically use Arceus-Rock.</li> <li>Checks to Ground-types, such as Giratina-O, Mega Salamence, and Primal Kyogre, can help Arceus-Rock manage its weakness and fit well into the bulky offense teams that Arceus-Rock typically finds itself in.</li> <li>Arceus-Rock hates being hit by Toxic, so a reliable Toxic absorber such as Ferrothorn, Magearna, Necrozma-DM, Zygarde-C, defensive Primal Kyogre, or Facade Mega Salamence can help it be more effective. Ferrothorn is a particularly good partner, as it greatly eases the matchup against Primal Kyogre.</li> </ul> "

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Arceus-Steel has high enough Speed to pose an immediate threat with Swords Dance and has room to run both Earthquake and Stone Edge as coverage, securing its niche as somewhat of a middle ground between offensive Necrozma-DM and Lucario, and Ultra Necrozma. Notably, Arceus-Steel isn't walled by Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Arceus-Steel also checks Mega Salamence and can pivot into Choice Scarf Xerneas that lacks a move to hit it hard enough.</li> <li>Arceus-Steel's many resistances and high bulk may make it seem like a good check to a number of Pokemon in the tier, but its exploitable weaknesses end up making it relatively easy to KO with coverage moves and common Pokemon like Zygarde-C, Arceus-Ground, Primal Groudon, and Marshadow. This alone makes Arceus-Steel a large detriment to any team it is on, mandating its team to be heavily prepared for the aforementioned threats.</li> <li>Arceus-Steel cannot take a boosted Focus Blast from Xerneas, so its team may need to stack weaknesses by using other Steel-type teammates to keep Xerneas in check.</li> <li>Arceus-Steel's general lack of power even with a Z-Crystal equipped leaves it as a generally inferior choice for an offensive Pokemon compared to the likes of Arceus-Ground and Marshadow, which can make much better use of a Z-Crystal, and other Steel-types that can provide superior utility both offensively and defensively. Using Arceus-Steel over other Arceus formes comes with significant opportunity cost as well due to its rather underwhelming defensive presence.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Iron Plate is the only possible item for Arceus-Steel if another teammate is holding a Z-Crystal. While said item provides Arceus-Steel with a better chance to OHKO uninvested Xerneas after Stealth Rock damage with Iron Head, the loss of Corkscrew Crash means Arceus-Steel will have a much harder time circumventing its checks like Zygarde and certain Arceus formes even with Swords Dance boosts.</li> <li>Iron Tail gives Arceus-Steel a stronger Corkscrew Crash, enabling it to outright OHKO max HP Arceus formes and have a considerable chance to remove Primal Kyogre and defensive Zygarde after little prior damage. Arceus-Steel will have to rely on an unreliable Steel-type move after using Corkscrew Crash, however.</li> <li>Extreme Speed provides Arceus-Steel with a way to pick off weaker threats and thus improves its matchup against offensive teams, but it is very weak without boosts and makes it forgo an important coverage move.</li> <li>Calm Mind enables Arceus-Steel to justify Recover and coverage moves like Earth Power and Thunder to bypass some checks like Skarmory, Celesteela, and Arceus-Water and also do more damage to Primal Groudon. However, this will make Arceus-Steel take longer to become threatening with boosts and may make it struggle against Pokemon it can deal with with its Swords Dance set, such as Ho-Oh and Blissey. Having significantly lower damage output against Necrozma-DM is detrimental as well.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-immune Steel-types</strong>: Celesteela and Skarmory's high physical bulk, resistance to Steel, and immunity to Earthquake mean that Arceus-Steel has very little chance to defeat them. Celesteela can wear down Arceus-Steel and burden switch-ins with Leech Seed. Skarmory is too passive to offensively threaten Arceus-Steel, but it can set Spikes against Arceus-Steel, punish the use of Iron Head with Rocky Helmet damage, and simply phaze Arceus-Steel with Whirlwind.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: A myriad of Ground-types can survive at least one boosted move from Arceus-Steel and retaliate against it. Almost any variant of Primal Groudon can survive a boosted Earthquake and OHKO Arceus-Steel with one of its STAB moves. Zygarde and Arceus-Ground are bulky enough to be efficient checks, but they have to be wary of a boosted Corkscrew Crash, which will OHKO them should they lack sufficient investment in bulk.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Marshadow is one of the best checks to Arceus-Steel due to its ability to OHKO Arceus-Steel with Close Combat and threaten to steal any potential Swords Dance boosts with Spectral Thief. Mega Mewtwo X is also an effective offensive check to Arceus-Steel, as it is faster than Arceus-Steel and OHKOes it with Low Kick.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Without Swords Dance boosts, Arceus-Steel has little chance to muscle past Arceus-Water before it is KOed by Judgment. A healthy Primal Kyogre can survive a boosted Earthquake after Stealth Rock damage and pick off a sufficiently weakened Arceus-Steel with Earthquake. Mega Gyarados can set up on a boosted Arceus-Steel after Intimidate and 2HKO it. Mega Slowbro is nearly impossible for Arceus-Steel to surmount due to its colossal physical bulk that enables it to shrug off even boosted attacks.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: The likes of defensive Zygarde, Giratina, and Buzzwole can take hits from Arceus-Steel relatively well due to their enormous physical bulk. However, they have to watch out for boosted Corkscrew Crash if weakened.</p> <p><strong>Coverage Moves: Many coverage moves like Fire Blast, Focus Blast, and Earthquake from foes like support Arceus formes, Mega Gengar, Mega Mewtwo Y, Mega Salamence, and Ultra Necrozma can exploit Arceus-Steel's common weaknesses to easily KO it.</p> ",

Recover also lets Arceus-Steel consistently pivot into resisted moves from foes like Mega Salamence and Choice Scarf Xerneas.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature maximizes Arceus-Steel's Speed, enabling it to outspeed Mega Lucario and revenge kill it with Earthquake and at worst Speed tie with other Arceus formes and Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Multitype and Steelium Z enable the use of Arceus-Steel and lets it use Corkscrew Crash, giving it a sudden burst of damage that is strong enough to take out maximum HP Arceus formes at +2 with some prior damage.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Try to switch Arceus-Steel into resisted attacks like Mega Salamence's Double-Edge and Choice Scarf Xerneas's Moonblast to maximize the chance it can successfully set up.</li> <li>Arceus-Steel can take aggressive approaches to set up against offensive teams when needed to net as much damage as possible. It is likely that offensive teams will lack a Pokemon that can effectively win one-on-one against a boosted Arceus-Steel. It is also worth noting that Arceus-Steel has a number of perks over other offensive Steel-types that it can capitalize on. Unlike Mega Lucario, Arceus-Steel can survive any attack from Deoxys-A and Mega Mewtwo Y from full health, and it does not fear Mega Gengar like Necrozma-DM does.</li> <li>Various conditions have to be fulfilled for Arceus-Steel to have a good chance to break through balanced teams. Entry hazards are mandatory to wear down checks like Primal Groudon and Zygarde-C that will survive a boosted attack when healthy. Status from teammates and hitting switch-ins with unboosted attacks are other effective ways to chip Arceus-Steel's checks. If not attempting to pull off a late-game sweep, Arceus-Steel can also be used early- and mid-game to cause meaningful damage to teams with unreliable checks to Steel-types and possibly KO neutral foes with a boosted Corkscrew Crash.</li> <li>Arceus-Steel's disappointing offensive typing and lack of initial power invites in many common Pokemon in the tier, thus forcing it to switch out and yield momentum. Note that while the likes of Skarmory and Celesteela can easily switch into Arceus-Steel's attacks, other checks like Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM have to be wary of boosted attacks from Arceus-Steel, as they will fall to boosted moves if sufficiently weakened.</li> <li>Though Arceus-Steel may seem like a decent status absorber, many Pokemon carrying Toxic can either threaten Arceus-Steel with other moves or easily take advantage of it. Examples of these include Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh as well as Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Skarmory that can set Spikes against Arceus-Steel. However, feel free to switch into predicted uses of Toxic from passive Pokemon like Lugia and Blissey that struggle to do much else to Arceus-Steel.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Another check to Fairy-types, particularly a check to Xerneas, is necessary, as Arceus-Steel fails to properly check Geomancy Xerneas and has limited longevity that prevents it from consistently pivoting into other Fairy-types. Both Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM can suffice for this role and also set up Stealth Rock or threaten defensive teams with more offensive sets, but note that these teammates will make the team more vulnerable to Ground-types overall.</li> <li>Mega Salamence and Giratina-O are other partners that come to the mind for this reason. Both of them are notable for being able to pivot into Ground-type attacks and check Primal Groudon, and they benefit from Arceus-Steel absorbing Toxic and pivoting into weak Fairy- and Ice-type attacks.</li> <li>Other airborne teammates like Yveltal and Ho-Oh can provide different utility. Yveltal deals with Arceus-Ground somewhat well, offensively checks Marshadow, and threatens Ground-immune Steel-types with Taunt. Ho-Oh provides the team with more security against Arceus-Ground, spreads status, and checks Primal Groudon, Geomancy Xerneas, and Fighting-types.</li> <li>Mega Gengar can trap defensive Skarmory should it lack Shed Shell and force a trade with other problematic Pokemon that the team cannot effectively deal with.</li> <li>Primal Kyogre offensively threatens many Ground-types, most notably Arceus-Ground, draws in and wears down Primal Groudon, and can run appropriate countermeasures to threaten defensive teams.</li> <li>Choice Scarf variants of Xerneas can deal with Zygarde-C and Marshadow, prevent Arceus-Steel from taking unnecessary damage from entry hazards with Defog, and function as a revenge killer. One use of Moonblast wears down offensive variants of Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM to the point that they will fall to Arceus-Steel's boosted Earthquake.</li> <li>On more offensive teams, Cloyster and Deoxys-S can provide Spikes support to rapidly wear down Arceus-Steel's grounded checks like Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Zygarde. The damage racked up by Spikes also helps Arceus-Steel OHKO neutral targets with a boosted Corkscrew Crash.</li> <li>Toxapex is a teammate to consider due to its ability to provide Toxic Spikes support, take advantage of Arceus-Water, and pivot into Ho-Oh and Marshadow.</li> </ul> "

  "Arceus-Water": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>The combination of a lone Water typing, solid bulk, and good Speed enables Arceus-Water to blanket check a massive portion of the tier, including some of the more common and dangerous Pokemon like Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, Arceus-Ground, Zygarde-C, Mega Salamence, and Mega Lucario.</li> <li>Arceus-Water's very valuable defensive presence justifies its place on many teams and enables it to diversify its moveset to fit utility moves like Stealth Rock and Will-O-Wisp, which not many support Arceus formes can afford to do.</li> <li>Although Arceus-Water can provide various utility options, its four-moveslot syndrome somewhat limits the size of its role compression. While it is not entirely impossible for Arceus-Water to forgo its common moves like Judgment and Ice Beam, replacing them results in dire consequences; forgoing Judgment no longer enables Arceus-Water to effectively handle Ho-Oh and Arceus-Ground, while not employing Ice Beam diminishes Arceus-Water's effectiveness against Zygarde-C and Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Arceus-Water's tendency to rely on super effective hits or Toxic stalling to check foes and inability to be a solid check for anything leave it vulnerable to threats like Swords Dance Primal Groudon, Ultra Necrozma, and other wallbreakers that it cannot pose an immediate threat against. Reliance on status means that Arceus-Water also struggles to handle bulky foes that aren't hindered by Toxic, such as Ferrothorn and Chansey.</li> <li>Much like other support Arceus formes, Arceus-Water is vulnerable to all types of entry hazards, status, and Shadow Tag users.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Arceus-Water is one of the very few viable support Arceus formes that can anti-lead against Cloyster, and its ability to blanket check Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM may make Defog seem like a viable option, but both Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM commonly run Toxic when running Stealth Rock. Arceus-Water is also faster than both of them, and this means it struggles to properly remove Stealth Rock from field even if has traded Toxic with the former.</li> <li>Fire Blast takes advantage of Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor's extreme vulnerability to Fire, preventing them from persistently switching into Arceus-Water. Fire Blast also provides Arceus-Water with a considerable chance to OHKO Mega Lucario after Stealth Rock damage.</li> <li>Waterium Z, Aqua Tail, and some Attack investment can be run to surprise Gothitelle by KOing it with Hydro Vortex after Ice Beam, but using a Z-Crystal and forgoing Judgment solely to achieve this benchmark isn't usually worth the cost.</li> <li>Earth Power hits Primal Groudon, Mega Gengar, and Steel-types like Necrozma-DM, Magearna, and Dialga, but it struggles to justify use.</li> <li>As one of the biggest annoyances for Arceus-Water is Toxic poison, Refresh may seem like an interesting way to completely wall support Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh, but forgoing Toxic or another utility move for this significantly hampers Arceus-Water's usefulness against foes that it otherwise has the upper hand against.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types That Resist Judgment</strong>: Ferrothorn completely walls Arceus-Water lacking Fire Blast and is only annoyed by Will-O-Wisp. After switching into Arceus-Water, Ferrothorn can proceed to set Spikes or use Leech Seed or Toxic on Arceus-Water or its switch-ins. Dialga isn't significantly threatened by any attacks from Arceus-Water and therefore can pivot into it multiple times and threaten back with Thunder or Toxic or proceed to set Stealth Rock of its own.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Primal Kyogre resists Judgment and Ice Beam and can easily break through Arceus-Water with Thunder or Calm Mind-boosted Origin Pulse. Toxapex also resists every common attack that Arceus-Water carries and can freely set up Toxic Spikes.</p> <p><strong>Gothitelle: Arceus-Water cannot significantly threaten Gothitelle and thus is prone to getting trapped and eliminated.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Foes</strong>: Both Chansey and Blissey aren't threatened by Arceus-Water at all due to them taking pathetic damage from any attacks and curing themselves of Toxic with Natural Cure. They can threaten to poison Arceus-Water with Toxic in return. Specially defensive Necrozma-DM avoids the 2HKO from Judgment and can stall out Arceus-Water with Toxic or set Stealth Rock on it.</p> <p><strong>Zekrom: Although it takes sizeable damage from Ice Beam, Zekrom can force out Arceus-Water by threatening to OHKO it with Bolt Strike.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Arceus-Grass is not 2HKOed by Ice Beam without Stealth Rock and additional prior damage and can OHKO Arceus-Water with Grass Knot after Stealth Rock. Shaymin-S is OHKOed by Ice Beam, but if given a safe switch, it can threaten to outspeed and OHKO Arceus-Water with Life Orb-boosted Seed Flare.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers: Arceus-Water's tendency to directly switch into foes to take resisted hits occasionally results in giving away free turns for foes set up. To specify, Arceus-Water is capable of pivoting into foes like Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and Ultra Necrozma before Ultra Burst, but it can't threaten them in any significant way with its conventional movesets. This issue is further exacerbated by Arceus-Water's reliance on its resistances to defensively check the aforementioned foes, meaning Arceus-Water can't reliably Toxic stall them before it is KOed by boosted attacks. This means that Swords Dance Primal Groudon and Ultra Necrozma can easily overwhelm Arceus-Water with boosts when Arceus-Water switches into them with an intention to scout their moveset or blanket check them. Apart from putting them on a timer with Toxic, Arceus-Water can do little against these setup sweepers.</p> <p><strong>Toxic: Toxic greatly reduces Arceus-Water's ability to pivot into foes it is tasked to switch into and consistently set Stealth Rock throughout the match.</p> ",

Will-O-Wisp also punishes Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, but the lack of Toxic will let Primal Groudon and Calm Mind Arceus formes to easily take advantage of Arceus-Water. While this move can be justified over Judgment, Arceus-Water will be unable to threaten Mega Gengar and Ho-Oh as a result.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>24 Special Defense EVs allow Arceus-Water to survive two full-powered Eruptions from Primal Groudon, which can be helpful if the former's Speed has been lowered by Sticky Web or paralysis.</li> <li>192 Speed EVs with a Timid nature ensure that Arceus-Water is faster than Mega Lucario, letting it pick off on Mega Lucario with Judgment before +2 Mega Lucario can OHKO Arceus-Water with Close Combat.</li> <li>Maximizing HP EVs and investing the remainder of the EVs in Defense improve Arceus-Water's overall bulk, augmenting its ability to take hits from Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Mega Salamence. To specify, extra investment in Defense enables Arceus-Water to survive +2 Necrozma-DM's Searing Sunraze Smash after Stealth Rock most of the time.</li> <li>An EV spread of 252 HP / 4 Def / 252 Spe can be used to Speed tie with other maximum Speed Arceus formes and Jolly Mega Salamence and prevent them from aggressively taking on Arceus-Water.</li> <li>A slower, bulkier EV spread of 252 HP / 168 Def / 88 Spe with a Bold nature increases Arceus-Water's bulk to the point where it can survive +2 Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades and still take on boosted Mega Lucario with considerable chances. The increased bulk also aids Arceus-Water's matchup against Zygarde-C and Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Splash Plate is required to use Arceus-Water with Water-type STAB Judgment.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Arceus-Water's Water typing enables it to pivot into various threatening Pokemon like Necrozma-DM, Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and Ho-Oh. While Arceus-Water does not handle every common attack from said foes well, it can reliably be used to scout them and potentially generate a predictable play from them. For example, pivoting into Primal Kyogre with Arceus-Water on a resisted attack can allow Primal Groudon to switch in unharmed if Arceus-Water successfully baited Thunder.</li> <li>Prevent Arceus-Water from taking excessive damage. Unless Arceus-Water is running a bulkier spread, it will have to remain as healthy as possible to survive some important attacks like +2 Searing Sunraze Smash from Necrozma-DM and +1 Double-Edge from Mega Salamence. This means that Recover should be used frequently to ensure that Arceus-Water remains healthy. Toxic should also be generally avoided in this regard, as it significantly reduces Arceus-Water's effectiveness as a pivot.</li> <li>Arceus-Water will have a considerable number of opportunities to use one of its utility options if it safely switched into a non-threatening attack like Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike or Arceus-Ground's Ice Beam. While Judgment has the highest damage output, Primal Groudon being the most common Pokemon in the tier makes this option generally inefficient. It is generally recommended to observe how an opponent reacts to Arceus-Water and then use an appropriate move. Should Primal Groudon or Primal Kyogre attempt to take advantage of Arceus-Water, they can be punished with Toxic, while Steel-types like Magearna and Celesteela can be chunked hard if they switched in to attempt to absorb Toxic.</li> <li>Do not unnecessarily leave Arceus-Water on the field against offensive foes in hopes of wearing them down. Be quick to switch it out of foes like Swords Dance variants of Primal Groudon and Ultra Necrozma to prevent their sweep. Arceus-Water can punish some setup sweepers with Will-O-Wisp, but it usually lacks enough offensive pressure to effectively weaken them.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Arceus-Water's valuable defensive presence is valued on most balanced teams. Defensive cores can be appropriately formed with Pokemon that create good defensive synergy with Arceus-Water, and wallbreakers can be paired with Arceus-Water to make up for its somewhat meager offensive presence.</li> <li>Most Steel-types appreciate Arceus-Water's ability to take on Fire- and Ground-types. As Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh offensively threaten Steel-types and some Arceus-Ground variants can take advantage of them, Arceus-Water will be frequently obligated to pivot into their respective STAB attacks and threaten them back with Judgment or, in Primal Groudon's case, put it on timer with Toxic. In return, Steel-types can switch into Toxic and provide different utility options. Magearna can handle powerful attackers like Xerneas and Yveltal and functions as a safety net against Refresh + Calm Mind Arceus formes that can set up on Arceus-Water. Ferrothorn checks support Necrozma-DM and other Arceus formes that usually carry Toxic. Furthermore, Leech Seed eases Arceus-Water's ability to pivot into foes that threaten Ferrothorn, and Spikes support prevents grounded foes like Primal Groudon and opposing Ferrothorn from consistently being annoyances. Offensive variants of Necrozma-DM can make up for Arceus-Water's lack of offensive presence and benefit from Arceus-Water hindering Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh.</li> <li>A more durable check to Primal Groudon is needed, as Arceus-Water fails to properly handle setup variants. Giratina-O and Skarmory are teammates that can prevent Double Dance Primal Groudon from setting up on Arceus-Water and rampaging through the team. Arceus-Water's ability to keep mixed Rock Polish Primal Groudon in line especially allows Skarmory and Arceus-Water to keep most Primal Groudon sets under control.</li> <li>While Arceus-Water is a check to Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground, it does not prevent them from setting Stealth Rock. Defog users like Mega Salamence, Ho-Oh, and Giratina-O can prevent Stealth Rock from chipping away at Arceus-Water's health, and they can also function as secondary checks to Primal Groudon. Mega Salamence can take advantage of Primal Groudon's Toxic to boost its Facade, while Ho-Oh outlasts it thanks to Regenerator. Giratina-O is notable for checking Swords Dance Arceus-Ground, which Arceus-Water will be a shaky check against due to +2 Tectonic Rage OHKOing it.</li> <li>While Arceus-Water can effectively deal with common Ground-immune Pokemon with Ice Beam, Stealth Rock support is still handy to wear down the opposing team. Primal Groudon is an option that can deal with problematic Steel-types like Ferrothorn and pressure a lot of Pokemon with its STAB attacks and Toxic. Necrozma-DM is another Stealth Rock user that can absorb Toxic relatively well and check certain support Arceus formes that Arceus-Water would avoid facing due to them potentially carrying Toxic. Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM both benefit from Arceus-Water handling Zygarde-C and Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>Magearna and Xerneas can provide cleric support for Arceus-Water, and Choice Scarf Xerneas can revenge kill dangerous sweepers like Ultra Necrozma and Zygarde-C. As both of them struggle with Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh, Arceus-Water's defensive presence against them is appreciated.</li> </ul> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Arceus-Water is justifiable as a Stealth Rock setter thanks to the limited number of Defog users that can contend against it. Favorable matchups against Ho-Oh, Mega Salamence, and Arceus-Ground makes it difficult for many teams to check Arceus-Water without preventing Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Judgment hits Ho-Oh and Arceus-Ground super effectively, and with a sizeable amount of investment, it can pressure most foes that are neutrally hit by it and notably 2HKO physically defensive Mega Sableye, preventing it from bouncing Stealth Rock back.</li> <li>Ice Beam provides Arceus-Water with coverage against Dragon-types and a way to damage Primal Groudon. It is important to note that invested Ice Beam can OHKO most offensive untransformed Zygarde after Stealth Rock damage.</li> <li>Recover ensures that Arceus-Water stays healthy enough to consistently pivot in to set Stealth Rock through the match.</li> <li>Toxic serves as a much more effective way to punish Primal Groudon than Ice Beam would, but it is hard to justify.</li> <li>Will-O-Wisp cripples Steel-types like Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn, preventing them from taking advantage of Arceus-Water for free.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>144 Special Attack EVs allow Arceus-Water to 2HKO Mega Sableye so it can set Stealth Rock against it. The investment also allows Arceus-Water to 2HKO offensive Necrozma-DM with Judgment after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKO offensive Yveltal most of the time with Ice Beam.</li> <li>96 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Arceus-Water to outspeed base 100 Speed Pokemon and below, making it faster than important threats like Xerneas and Yveltal.</li> <li>The remainder of the EVs are used to maximize Arceus-Water's HP and increase Defense a little, allowing it to survive +2 Searing Sunraze Smash from Necrozma-DM and +1 Mega Salamence's Double-Edge from full HP.</li> <li>Splash Plate is required to use Arceus-Water with Water-type STAB Judgment.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Arceus-Water's primary objective is to ensure that Stealth Rock remains on the field, and Arceus-Water's offensive typing and investment help fulfill this goal. As Judgment and Ice Beam threaten Ho-Oh, Mega Salamence, and Arceus-Ground, many balanced teams will generally struggle to prevent Arceus-Water from setting Stealth Rock. Arceus-Water's ability to pressure Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie should also be noted, as they struggle taking Judgment and thus cannot safely utilize Magic Bounce.</li> <li>Setting Stealth Rock first is usually the most productive thing to do when Arceus-Water is given an opportunity to switch in, as this helps pressure the opposing team. Observe how an opponent reacts to Arceus-Water; since opponents tend to switch Toxic-immune foes or Pokemon that do not mind its attacks into it, knowing what Pokemon is sent to deal with Arceus-Water means that it can hit them with appropriate moves on the switch. Most Steel-types except Ferrothorn that switch in expecting Toxic take considerable amounts of damage from Judgment, and Primal Groudon dislikes switching into Ice Beam multiple times, especially when Stealth Rock is up, so carefully evaluate your opponent to benefit the most from this set.</li> <li>Unless a foe is confirmed to lack status moves or a significant way to threaten Arceus-Water, switch Arceus-Water out after setting Stealth Rock or attacking a foe. The lack of Toxic means that Arceus-Water can do little to foes that are bulky enough to take its attacks, such as other Arceus formes, in the long run, and it is likely that they will use Toxic after switching in. If given a favorable matchup, hit something hard with Judgment or use Recover so Arceus-Water will be healthy enough to pivot into foes again.</li> <li>As this set runs less Speed investment, faster foes like Mega Salamence and Mega Lucario can pick off weakened Arceus-Water. This means health management is more important to ensure that Arceus-Water can take a hit from naturally faster or Speed-boosted foes and retaliate.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Pokemon that appreciate a Stealth Rock user that can pressure bulky Defog users make good partners to this set. The likes of Primal Groudon and Marshadow, which dislike certain Flying-types, can benefit from the pressure that Arceus-Water applies to them with Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Arceus-Water also frees up a moveslot for other, more standard Stealth Rock users like Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM. Depending on the sets they run, both of these Pokemon naturally struggle against Ho-Oh and Yveltal, so they can benefit from Stealth Rock keeping both foes at bay and can run offensive sets to contend against them better. Primal Groudon also appreciates Arceus-Water pressuring Zygarde-C, which it can threaten to OHKO with invested Ice Beam.</li> <li>As Arceus-Water can do very little against Primal Groudon, Pokemon like Zygarde-C, Ho-Oh, and Giratina-O can act as a secondary check to it. Arceus-Water's ability to scout Ice- and Rock-type moves from Primal Groudon for the former two is beneficial, and they can handle Primal Groudon with Toxic.</li> <li>Arceus-Water's lack of Toxic means it cannot threaten Primal Kyogre and other support Arceus formes in a significant way. Primal Groudon checks Primal Kyogre and some support Arceus formes, and support sets can run Toxic to poison them so they cannot consistently take advantage of Arceus-Water. Mega Gengar can trap and remove some support Arceus formes and problematic special walls or force a trade with Defog users that Arceus-Water cannot threaten. In return, Arceus-Water is capable of pivoting into foes like Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh that tend to switch into Mega Gengar on its Mega Evolution.</li> <li>Offensive Pokemon like Rock Polish Primal Groudon, Marshadow, and Rayquaza require Stealth Rock support to successfully break through opposing teams. As Arceus-Water's matchup against offensive teams isn't great due to less Speed investment, the aforementioned teammates can patch up this weakness.</li> <li>Clerics like Xerneas and Magearna can help Arceus-Water stay healthy and consistently set Stealth Rock throughout the match. Choice Scarf Xerneas can revenge kill various foes like Ultra Necrozma and other setup sweepers that Arceus-Water fails to check properly due to less Speed investment.</li> </ul> "

As a result, bulkier Stealth Rock users like Primal Groudon are often preferred due to their ability to set Stealth Rock up throughout the match.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Excadrill can utilize an offensive sweeping set with sand support consisting of Swords Dance, Earthquake, Iron Head or Rock Slide, and Rapid Spin with either Groundium Z or Life Orb thanks to its Sand Rush ability. However, such a set is immediately shut down by the removal of sand, which is easily accomplished by Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre, and is hampered by sand being limited to five or eight turns. Another thing to keep in mind if you use Life Orb is that Rapid Spin doesn't work if the recoil KOes Excadrill.</li> <li>Bulldoze combines the Speed drop of Rock Tomb with the STAB of Earthquake in one slot; however, if one forgoes Rock Tomb, Flying-types become an issue.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Cloyster</strong>: Cloyster can use Shell Smash and easily remove Excadrill with Icicle Spear, as it bypasses Excadrill's Focus Sash and can Rapid Spin away the Stealth Rock Excadrill's trying to put up. Put simply, Cloyster always beats Excadrill in lead matchups.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Setup Sweepers</strong>: Bulky Pokemon such as Arceus, Zygarde-C, and Mega Salamence can easily set up on Excadrill's attacks by utilizing Substitute to block Toxic and repeatedly setting up, dealing massive damage very early on.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn: Iron Barbs makes Excadrill take damage every time it uses Rapid Spin, allowing Ferrothorn to set up two layers of Spikes, as Rapid Spin doesn't clear entry hazards if the user is KOed by recoil. Earthquake-less sets can't touch Ferrothorn, and even with it the damage dealt is easily healed with Leech Seed and Leftovers recovery.</p> <p><strong>Rocky Helmet Skarmory</strong>: Excadrill can't touch Skarmory, but Skarmory can't really touch Excadrill either without Rocky Helmet. With Rocky Helmet, Skarmory acts similarly to Ferrothorn in that Excadrill can't use Rapid Spin without suffering from recoil damage, which lets Skarmory get two layers of Spikes up.</p> <p><strong>Defog Leftovers Lunala</strong>: Excadrill can't set up Stealth Rock and break Shadow Shield at the same time due to Leftovers healing Rock Tomb damage and Moongeist Beam 2HKOing Excadrill, meaning that Lunala can easily Defog Stealth Rock away on whatever comes in; however, Toxic does prove a significant thorn in Lunala's side.</p> <p><strong>Taunt</strong>: Taunt prevents Stealth Rock and Toxic; however, keep in mind Excadrill can simply use its offensive moves to punish the most common users of the move.</p> ",

Non-Ground-immune Taunt users like Mega Gengar dislike Earthquake as well due to Excadrill's decent Attack stat.</li> <li>Forgoing Rapid Spin in order to run Rock Tomb, Toxic, and Earthquake on one set is an option, but doing so leaves Excadrill without a way to clear hazards, which is one of the biggest reasons to use it.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>252 EVs in Attack and Speed combined with a Jolly nature give Excadrill the most effectiveness, letting it outspeed anything below maximum Speed base 90s, neutral-natured Zygarde, and everything except maximum Speed Deoxys-S after a Rock Tomb while making Earthquake and Rock Tomb do the most damage.</li> <li>Focus Sash is required because Excadrill's poor bulk and mediocre defensive typing leave it OHKOed by many Pokemon that it's trying to lead against.</li> <li>Mold Breaker gives Excadrill its niche of setting up Stealth Rock on Magic Bounce users and allows Earthquake to hit Pokemon with Levitate, such as Giratina-O.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Using Rock Tomb first is often a good option, as Excadrill can outspeed most Pokemon after one use, giving some chip damage and a Speed drop to go along with Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Excadrill unfortunately loses the lead matchup versus Cloyster, meaning going to an alternate lead is almost always a better plan.</li> <li>As a suicide lead, Excadrill's purpose is getting Stealth Rock up while denying your opponent's entry hazards. Sacrificing Excadrill is usually preferred over saving it because you are able to gain an advantage by switching in the appropriate threat.</li> <li>Excadrill has the ability to keep Stealth Rock up against support Arceus formes due to its Toxic immunity, the rarity of Will-O-Wisp, and Defog having less PP than Stealth Rock.</li> <li>While Taunt users can prevent Stealth Rock, Excadrill has other ways of crippling them. For example, Yveltal takes decent damage from Rock Tomb and Mewtwo along with its Mega Evolutions dislike the Speed drop and take significant damage from Earthquake.</li> <li>If not used as a lead, Excadrill can find some use later in the game provided that its Focus Sash isn't broken, as Earthquake 2HKOes Primal Groudon and can stop a sweep provided that chip damage is given.</li> <li>Against an Arceus-Ground, you must pay special attention to the opponent's team structure to determine your next move. If it appears to be the only Defogger, it is most likely a support variant, and you should use Rock Tomb. If it is not, Stealth Rock is best, as Swords Dance sets with Substitute can inflict massive damage otherwise and Rock Tomb does very little to the Substitute. Earthquake has value here in breaking the Substitute, as Rock Tomb does not.</li> <li>Dealing with Deoxys-S depends on if your opponent has a Ghost-type or not. If one is present, spamming Rapid Spin is a surefire way to clear hazards while slowly wearing Deoxys-S down. However, if one isn't present, two Rock Tombs let Excadrill outspeed it and set up Stealth Rock when Taunt runs out and click Rapid Spin until you win again. Something worth mentioning is Rocky Helmet, which makes the Rapid Spin spamming strategy useless if Deoxys-S is wielding it. Fortunately, Earthquake can easily dispatch the frail speedster.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>As a suicide lead, Excadrill fits only on hyper offense archetypes, which have the offensive pressure to punish Defog users and appreciate Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Marshadow is a valuable Pokemon, as its combination of typing, Speed, and movepool lets it function as a priority safety net and anti-offense tool for defeating certain threats that otherwise could cause problems. In addition to this, Spectral Thief bypasses Substitute, allowing it to defeat the Substitute users that otherwise would set up on Excadrill. Its typing also gives it spinblocking capability, which is appreciated in certain matchups.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM is also useful, as it beats Cloyster one-on-one. However, it cannot prevent Cloyster from getting Spikes or Toxic Spikes up. Outside of this, Necrozma-DM is an excellent setup sweeper that appreciates the Stealth Rock that Excadrill sets because it pressures Ho-Oh and Yveltal, two common answers to Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>A Taunt user is useful, as the move tends to stop Cloyster from doing too much, beats Smeargle more easily, and prevents Defog. Popular users of the move include Yveltal and Mega Gengar.</li> <li>Mega Gengar in particular can trap and remove certain Defog users, such as Arceus-Water and Xerneas, and utilizes Taunt, providing the benefits mentioned above along with spinblocking capability. Icy Wind also lets it defeat Cloyster one-on-one while avoiding the KO, as +1 Cloyster does not outspeed.</li> <li>Priority users such as Yveltal, Marshadow, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Rayquaza can defeat runaway setup sweepers that set up on Excadrill.</li> <li>Almost every setup sweeper and wallbreaker appreciates Stealth Rock. Examples include Xerneas, Necrozma-DM, Primal Groudon, Zygarde-C, and Yveltal. Xerneas is able to directly threaten support Arceus formes, Primal Groudon can threaten almost everything due to the Speed drop, Zygarde-C appreciates support Arceus formes being hit with Toxic, and Yveltal is able to taunt support Arceus formes thanks to the Speed drop.</li> </ul> "

  "Gothorita": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Gothorita is one of the unique picks in Ubers due to its ability to remove and neutralize passive and problematic Pokemon with Shadow Tag.</li> <li>Though Gothorita is an alternative Shadow Tag trapper that performs the same role as Gothitelle, it has superior bulk with Eviolite. This gives Gothorita the ability to trap more powerful foes that Gothitelle cannot.</li> <li>Some Pokemon like Choice Scarf Xerneas and, if running Defense investment, defensive Ho-Oh are vulnerable to Gothorita. Gothorita will therefore have more usefulness against some balanced and offensive teams, unlike Gothitelle, which tends to rely on the number of a slower and weaker Pokemon present on the other team to be effective.</li> <li>As a Pokemon that aims to switch into and neutralize passive foes, Gothorita may seem like a superior performer of this role due to its better marginal bulk. However, the process of neutralizing a Pokemon takes long enough for Gothitelle's Leftovers to outweigh the helpfulness of the additional bulk that Gothorita gains from Eviolite.</li> <li>Gothorita's lack of Leftovers also demands players to be more cautious when bringing it into the field, as switching into the field with entry hazards at a wrong time makes taking advantage of its higher bulk more difficult. The lack of Leftovers also makes the matchup against Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Mega Venusaur more difficult, as Gothitelle can mitigate the damage at the end of each turn with Leftovers, while Gothorita will take more sizable damage from Leech Seed each turn and thus spend more time and PP to successfully neutralize them.</li> <li>Better bulk doesn't help too much with Gothorita's tendency to rely on matchups to be effective; Gothorita is still a risky Pokemon to employ due to its helplessness against most offensive teams.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Gothorita has little to no viable other options to utilize, as it is too slow, frail, and weak to justify any other set.</li> <li>Toxic may seem attractive due to it more quickly removing trapped Pokemon, but this hinders Gothorita's trapping capability by forcing it to forgo one of its other moves. Using Toxic also removes Gothorita's ability to at worst hinder Steel-types like defensive Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn lacking Bullet Seed.</li> <li>Trick Room can be set for Gothorita's team after trapping an appropriate foe, but more reliable Trick Room users are available and Gothorita lacks the ability to generate momentum and directly threaten a foe.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Offensive Powerhouses</strong>: Gothorita's low Speed, lackluster defensive typing, and mediocre bulk make it vulnerable to most foes that are offensively oriented. Very common examples like Primal Groudon, Yveltal, and Primal Kyogre can double switch into Gothorita and easily force it out.</p> <p><strong>Shed Shell: Some passive Pokemon like Blissey, Toxapex, and Skarmory are aware of Gothorita's existence in the tier, and they hold Shed Shell to prevent them from getting trapped. Gothorita typically lacks a way to redeem its reduced usefulness in these matchups.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Ghost-types like Mega Gengar, Marshadow, and Giratina-O cannot be trapped by Shadow Tag, and they can threaten Gothorita with their super effective STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Yveltal, Arceus-Dark, and Choice Band Tyranitar can overpower Gothorita with their super effective attacks. However, it is important to note that Gothorita can trap support variants of Tyranitar with correct prediction.</p> <p><strong>Pivoting Moves and Phazing Moves: Magearna and defensive Zygarde-C have little concern against Gothorita due to their access to Volt Switch and Dragon Tail, respectively, which forces Gothorita to exit the field.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Due to the lack of Leftovers, Gothorita is more vulnerable to entry hazards than Gothitelle, making it think twice before switching into the field to trap a passive foe. This also makes the matchup against Ferrothorn and Celesteela a lot less reliable, as they can use Leech Seed on Gothorita when it is asleep and continue to prevail.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Charm and Confide are used to neutralize Pokemon that will struggle to KO Gothorita with reduced damage output.</li> <li>While Gothorita can easily overcome status with Rest, Taunt is still used to force attacks from trapped foes and make their attacking moves' PP diminish more quickly. Taunt also comes in handy for Gothorita in an event where it traps a Pokemon that it can temporarily shut down but struggles to outlast in the long run, such as Ferrothorn, which will struggle to punish a switch-in once Gothorita cripples it with Taunt and switches out.</li> <li>Rest is used to give Gothorita a way to overcome repeated attacks from trapped foes and status ailments.</li> <li>Though it is difficult to fit, Heal Bell is worth considering to let Gothorita support its teammates even more and be more useful in an unfavorable matchup.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum investment in HP and Special Defense with a Sassy nature improves Gothorita's ability to take special attacks from Arceus formes and notably enables it to switch into Choice Scarf Xerneas and neutralize it. Minimum Speed is used to take minimal damage from Ferrothorn's Gyro Ball, and this is hardly detrimental, as Gothorita is slower than Celesteela anyway.</li> <li>An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 112 Def / 144 SpD can be used to enable Gothorita to trap defensive Ho-Oh while still avoiding the 3HKO from support Arceus formes after Stealth Rock.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>In order to neutralize foes, switch Gothorita into weaker attacks like support Arceus formes' Judgment and any attack from defensive Ho-Oh and repeatedly use Charm or Confide, Taunt, and Rest to deplete the PP of all attacking moves from the victim. Trapped foes will eventually run out of their attacks' PP and will start to use Struggle until they faint, which can be completely taken advantage of by Gothorita's teammates.</li> <li>As Gothorita will rely on PP stalling to neutralize a foe that it traps, make the best use of moves like Rest, which can potentially buy 48 turns, and Confide, which has just enough PP to stall out Calm Mind from Arceus formes.</li> <li>Though Gothorita's bulk is superior to Gothitelle's, it will sometimes have to be more cautious about directly switching into attacks. An opponent may make double switches if they want their defensive Pokemon away from a hazardous situation, and entry hazards are going to punish Gothorita with every misprediction. Also, losing momentum can result in varying consequences.</li> <li>This becomes less of a concern against slower teams, however, as many Pokemon that Gothorita can't necessarily trap cannot pose an immediate threat on Gothorita's switch. Slower teams also have many Pokemon that reliably switch into threats that they can reliably check, so this improves the odds for Gothorita to successfully trap problematic foes.</li> <li>Against other teams, Gothorita can switch into support Arceus formes and potentially Choice Scarf Xerneas and defensive Ho-Oh as well. Being able to trap the latter two depending on EV investment can be particularly useful; Xerneas will refrain from using valuable utility moves like Aromatherapy and Defog, and Ho-Oh will think twice before attempting to spread Toxic or use Defog.</li> <li>It may be tempting to make a quick move to eliminate passive foes for Gothorita's teammates, but patience will be an important factor for successfully using Gothorita. Depending on the rest of its team, Choice Scarf Yveltal locked into Oblivion Wing or defensive Necrozma-DM lacking Solganium Z or Swords Dance may have to be removed first. Scouting early-game will also generate an opportunity to observe how an opponent behaves against Gothorita paranoid opponents can be pressured into making predictions with Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar and Alolan Muk at a certain point, while a reckless opponent is more likely to be punished and lose one of their important Pokemon after a single misplay.</li> <li>Have extra caution against Pokemon with Leech Seed. While Gothitelle will lose 1/16 of its health every turn because of Leftovers, Gothorita will lose 1/8 of its health every turn, making it less effective when PP stalling against Leech Seed users. Celesteela does sizable damage with Heavy Slam before Gothorita's Charm, and Ferrothorn beats Gothorita one-on-one with Bullet Seed and uses a lot of Gothorita's PP even if using another attack.</li> <li>Most other Pokemon that Gothorita traps are easily neutralized by Charm and Confide. However, remember the amount of damage that Gothorita takes from the first blow, and if the next attack is going to weaken Gothorita enough to be taken out by a critical hit, use Rest. Although this may seem like an inefficient use of PP for a Pokemon that attempts to PP stall foes, Gothorita will likely outlast them anyway, and making passive foes run out of attacking moves is enough for its teammates to fully take advantage of them. As an example, Substitute users like Zygarde will have no fear against Taunted Arceus formes with no attacking moves left.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Though Gothorita's usefulness is dependent on the opposing team, it can often trap and cripple at least one foe in many matchups. Support Arceus formes are seen on most teams due to their ability to blanket check a lot of Pokemon in the tier, so sweepers like Rock Polish Primal Groudon, Zygarde-C, and Mega Salamence can be considered. The synergy with Zygarde is going to be stronger if Zygarde has Thousand Waves, allowing Gothorita to immediately create a favorable matchup against a trapped switch-in.</li> <li>Removing support Arceus formes can also benefit teammates like defensive Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, and an Arceus forme using Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Teammates that can put in work against offensive teams can be helpful, as Gothorita will not likely have any foe it can reliably trap. Priority move users like Marshadow and Choice Scarf users like Xerneas and Yveltal can patch up this weakness, and Gothorita can trap many of their checks. Choice Scarf Yveltal is noteworthy for bringing in Gothorita safely with U-turn.</li> <li>Consider employing an Arceus forme that will have some defensive presence. Using Gothorita can be hazardous otherwise due to the almost nonexistent defensive presence it has against any foe it cannot trap. Depending on the type, a support Arceus forme can be used to blanket check physical attackers or Dark- and Ghost-types. Any reasonable Arceus forme will appreciate Gothorita switching into Toxic and likely trapping the user, and they can be further supported if Gothorita has Heal Bell. If they are using Defog, they can swiftly remove entry hazards from Pokemon like Ferrothorn and opposing Arceus formes that may have set up while dealing with Gothorita.</li> </ul> "

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Gothitelle is known for its ability to trap and dispose of passive Pokemon that form the defensive backbone of stall and balance teams, including support Arceus formes, Chansey, Ferrothorn, defensive Necrozma-DM, Lugia, and numerous other Pokemon.</li> <li>The wide range of Pokemon it can trap allows it to fit on both offensive and defensive teams, where it can clear away the stops to sweepers such as Mega Salamence or support a more anti-offense-oriented backbone with an edge against stall teams. This flexibility is bolstered by it not needing a Mega slot or Z-Crystal, in contrast to the tier's other prominent trapper in Mega Gengar.</li> <li>Gothitelle’s trapping range notably includes many of the tier’s best Defoggers, which provides a strong matchup against archetypes weak to Stealth Rock such as Ho-Oh balance.</li> <li>Gothitelle can also be used as a hard-punish option against Choice item users. Notably, it can trap and revenge kill Yveltal locked into Defog or Oblivion Wing and Choice Scarf Xerneas, both prominent Pokemon in the tier.</li> <li>Furthermore, Gothitelle can switch out after depriving a foe of all of its useful moves, providing a teammate with a true free turn against a completely helpless opponent.</li> <li>However, Gothitelle lends no defensive utility to any team, which can make it difficult to fit into many archetypes. Its low bulk also makes it rely on free switches and risky reads to conduct some of its traps.</li> <li>Gothitelle provides far more utility against defensive and balance archetypes and is often relegated to death fodder against hyper offense teams.</li> <li>Overall, Gothitelle is difficult to fit into most archetypes and is not particularly good as a standalone Pokemon, but its unique niche as a trapper of passive Pokemon is devastating in a team built around taking advantage of it, making it a feared Pokemon in the tier.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>A Calm Mind trapping set can be run using Rest, Psyshock, and either Taunt or Charm. This set distinguishes itself from the PP stalling set by having a much better matchup against Calm Mind Arceus formes and by eliminating foes faster than the PP stalling set. However, this set suffers from missing out on either Taunt or Charm, so it must sacrifice the ability to trap some of its targets, and Calm Mind Arceus formes are not very common, so it is typically inferior to PP stalling sets and should not be used except in very specific team builds.</li> <li>Heal Bell and Thunder Wave can be used at the cost of limiting Gothitelle's trapping capabilities by sacrificing Taunt or Charm, giving Gothitelle some utility aside from trapping. However, these moves are usually better on durable Pokemon that can use them throughout the match, and these moves difficult are to justify use on teams where Taunt or Charm would be more useful in general.</li> <li>On Trick Room teams, Trick Room can provide some guaranteed utility for Gothitelle, although it struggles to find room in its moveset for it. Some sets run this move on the Calm Mind set to sweep, but this is very ineffective.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Gothitelle has the ability to choose its matchups with Shadow Tag. As a result, it cannot be traditionally countered, and its checks are generally just Pokemon it cannot trap.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar, Alolan Muk, and Marshadow will either KO Gothitelle with Pursuit or weaken it to the point of uselessness.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Threats: With whatever bulk investment Gothitelle may use, hard hitters break through it with ease. Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Mega Salamence, offensive Ho-Oh, and just about any other offensive Pokemon will break through Gothitelle just by using STAB moves, so they cannot be trapped.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage: Gothitelle is not a very bulky Pokemon, and just about any viable Pokemon can break free using Dark- or Ghost-type coverage moves such as Knock Off and Dark Pulse.</p> <p><strong>Shed Shell</strong>: Pokemon that carry Shed Shell, notably Blissey, Toxapex, and Skarmory, cannot be trapped by Gothitelle, making it useless against them.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt completely shuts down Gothitelle, so it cannot trap Pokemon that carry Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Pivoting Moves</strong>: Volt Switch and U-turn break through Gothitelle’s Shadow Tag, so it cannot trap Pokemon that carry these moves, most notably Magearna.</p> <p><strong>Phazing Moves: Roar and Whirlwind allow Pokemon such as Lugia to break free from Gothitelle, so Gothitelle sets without Taunt cannot trap these Pokemon effectively. Dragon Tail will allow Pokemon such as Zygarde to break free regardless of Gothitelle’s set.</p> ",

        "name": "PP Stall",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Confide allows Gothitelle to trap passive special attackers such as support Arceus formes by lowering the opposing Pokemon's Special Attack stat. Gothitelle starts its trapping by using Confide whenever it is healthy enough to survive a critical hit from the foe and Rest when it cannot.</li> <li>Charm allows Gothitelle to trap passive physical attackers such as Celesteela and defensive Necrozma-DM, in the same manner as Confide.</li> <li>Taunt allows Gothitelle to stop Pokemon from phazing it, setting up entry hazards during the PP stall, setting up Leech Seed, and otherwise interfering with the trapping. After Gothitelle has inflicted enough stat drops, it can use Taunt to limit the opposing Pokemon to one or two of its moves, speeding up a PP stall significantly.</li> <li>Rest clears the Toxic that many passive Pokemon rely on for damage and fully recovers Gothitelle's HP. It also takes up three turns for each of its uses, making Gothitelle win most PP stalls in conjunction with Taunt.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Shadow Tag allows Gothitelle to trap and KO passive Pokemon and is the only reason it is viable in the Ubers tier.</li> <li>Leftovers provides Gothitelle with passive recovery.</li> <li>The Defense investment allows Gothitelle to avoid being trapped by support Tyranitar if healthy and improves Gothitelle's matchup against threats such as Celesteela and Ferrothorn without sacrificing the ability to trap support Arceus formes confidently.</li> <li>More Defense or Special Defense could be run to improve Gothitelle's matchups against key Pokemon for specific teams, but it sacrifices some of Gothitelle's overall utility.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Gothitelle most rewards gathering information about your opponent’s sets. If you can figure out that the opposing Necrozma-DM is running the defensive set, that the enemy Yveltal that just used Oblivion Wing has a Choice Scarf, or that the enemy Magearna neglected Volt Switch so it could run Heal Bell, it offers opportunities for KOs that one would normally not try for. Keep an eye out throughout the match.</li> <li>Once a foe has been completely deprived of PP for its useful moves, a teammate that can take advantage of a free turn should be switched in against the completely helpless foe. This is especially useful for getting rid of hazards the opponent may set up during the PP stall, setting up hazards the opponent may have cleared during the PP stall, or just setting up with a sweeper at full HP.</li> <li>Remember that the opponent can try to double switch. If they make a move that is obviously a mistake against a team with Gothitelle, it is often a trick to give a physical attacker such as Primal Groudon a free switch. This also means that Pokemon traditionally caught by Gothitelle but partially able to defend themselves, such as Celesteela, are effectively caught with a double switch.</li> <li>Be patient when setting up a PP stall. Critical hits break through stat drops, and secondary effects such as Ice Beam freezes can overwhelm Gothitelle, and these are more likely to happen than not when trying to take away all the PP of an attack. Once enough stat drops are applied for this to be possible, use Rest whenever Gothitelle's health falls below KO range of a critical hit followed by a normal hit.</li> <li>Be careful not to overestimate Gothitelle’s bulk. Hard switching into attacks stronger than Arceus-Water’s Ice Beam, especially when Stealth Rock is up, will often result in a losing matchup against Pokemon Gothitelle could usually try to trap. Rely on free switches or reads to get Gothitelle in.</li> <li>Be prepared to clean up if you let a threat such as Ferrothorn or Toxapex set up full layers of Spikes or Toxic Spikes in the process of trapping.</li> <li>Switch out on the turn the opposing Pokemon uses its last Struggle to a Pokemon that can be less easily taken advantage of with a free switch.</li> <li>Be careful not to let Gothitelle be Pursuit trapped. Against stall teams with Tyranitar or Alolan Muk, don't send out Gothitelle until these threats are worn down. If caught by one of these Pokemon, try to create a situation when you can switch out by using Charm rather than switching out immediately, and ideally Gothitelle will preserve some of its health. If support Tyranitar lacks Crunch, it can even be trapped and KOed due to Pursuit's low power.</li> <li>Players are often very hesitant to play traditional Gothitelle targets when they see a Gothitelle on the enemy team. Be aggressive with offensive Pokemon such as Primal Groudon that would be checked by these trappable Pokemon, putting pressure on your opponent and forcing them into risky predictions.</li> <li>Passive Pokemon often run niche sets capable of luring Gothitelle or breaking out of Shadow Tag, such as Roar or a Z-Crystal on support Arceus sets, Solganium Z on defensive Necrozma-DM, and Dragon Tail on Lugia. Be wary of these lures and failed traps and rely on your other Pokemon to take advantage the coverage they forego to manage Gothitelle.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Gothitelle is not a Pokemon that can be fitted onto most teams, as it occupies a very specific (albeit powerful) niche as a trapper of passive Pokemon. While it has a lot of flexibility, it should always be run with the deliberate intention to clear specific checks of specific teammates to achieve some form of win condition.</li> <li>Life Orb Marshadow makes an excellent core with Gothitelle, as its strong priority and coverage give it a strong matchup against offensive teams, largely making up for Gothitelle's lack of utility in that matchup. In return, Gothitelle can dispose of switch-ins to Marshadow such as support Arceus formes.</li> <li>Other sweepers and wallbreakers that dislike defensive Arceus formes or other targets of Gothitelle, such as offensive Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Mega Salamence, Yveltal, Choice Scarf Xerneas, and Necrozma-DM, among several others, can enjoy support from Gothitelle on offensive teams.</li> <li>Since Gothitelle is effective at taking out enemy Defoggers and some Stealth Rock setters, it is good at making situations where only its team has entry hazards up mid-game. Because of this, it partners better with durable hazard setters that can last a whole game, such as Arceus-Fairy and Necrozma-DM, rather than suicide or easily worn down hazard setters such as Deoxys-S and Primal Groudon. Similarly, it enjoys the support of durable Defoggers, such as the support Arceus sets it loves to trap.</li> <li>A decent physically defensive backbone can be useful to help Gothitelle against physical threats, so Pokemon such as Zygarde-C, Mega Salamence, and Arceus-Ground are good partners.</li> <li>Gothitelle likes having Volt Switch or U-turn support to come in on its targets without being attacked or double switched on. Choice Scarf Yveltal and Volt Switch Magearna usually fit well on teams with Gothitelle and provide this role effectively.</li> </ul> "

Ho-Oh in particular doesn't care about Leech Seed damage thanks to Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Marshadow, Mega Lucario, Mega Mewtwo X, and Mega Blaziken are able to force out Ferrothorn, and some of them are able to set up while doing so. Due to narrow counterplay, it is especially dangerous to give setup opportunities to the former two. Mega Mewtwo X is able to use Taunt on Ferrothorn to stop Spikes and Leech Seed or simply KO it with Low Kick or Drain Punch.</p> <p><strong>Coverage Moves: Fire-type coverage moves are ways Ferrothorn is easily disposed of. Hidden Power Fire from Xerneas, Fire Blast from Mewtwo, Naganadel, support Arceus formes, Dialga, and Palkia, and the rare Heat Wave from Ultra Necrozma are prime examples that are able to outright eliminate Ferrothorn. Focus Blast from Mega Gengar, Lunala, and Mewtwo and Superpower from Deoxys-A easily 2HKO Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye: Ferrothorn is hopelessly shut down by the presence of Mega Sableye due to Magic Bounce bouncing back hazards and Leech Seed, leaving it unable to set hazards, spread status, or recover itself. Mega Sableye can burn Ferrothorn with Will-O-Wisp to nullify recovery from Leftovers and force Ferrothorn to slowly succumb to repeated attacks. Threats such as support Arceus formes and Primal Kyogre, which Ferrothorn is tasked to switch into consistently, can take advantage of this and slowly wear it down while Ferrothorn can't do much in return.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Users: Although Substitute users are uncommon, they are able to take advantage of Ferrothorn's passivity and reliance on Leech Seed to set up on it or wear it down. Examples include offensive Zygarde-C with Substitute and Dragon Dance, Primal Kyogre with Substitute and Calm Mind, and Zekrom with Substitute and Hone Claws. However, Primal Kyogre can still be taken care of if Ferrothorn runs Power Whip.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Taunt leaves Ferrothorn unable to recover itself with Leech Seed or set hazards. However, common users of Taunt, such as Mega Gengar and Yveltal, take considerable damage from Gyro Ball.</p> <p><strong>Gothitelle: Due to Shadow Tag, Ferrothorn is unable to switch out from Gothitelle while it is completely neutralized with Taunt and Charm.</p> <p><strong>Consistent Hazard Removers</strong>: Giratina is able to win the PP war against Ferrothorn thanks to Pressure. Pressure also limits the number of times Ferrothorn is able to use Leech Seed throughout the match. Giratina can also use Rest to get rid of damage dealt from Leech Seed or status. Mega Scizor can counter Ferrothorn in the same way if using the rare Defog.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Spikes wears down grounded foes very quickly, and this helps late-game sweepers such as Dragon Dance Rayquaza, Geomancy Xerneas, and Swords Dance Arceus successfully sweep.</li> <li>Stealth Rock can be used if Ferrothorn's teammates do not have access to this move, but it is usually better for Ferrothorn to set Spikes instead due to its ability to consistently switch into support Arceus formes and set hazards. Ferrothorn also tends to naturally draw in threats weak to Stealth Rock, such as Ho-Oh and Mega Salamence, making this option a questionable choice.</li> <li>Leech Seed lets Ferrothorn wear down switch-ins such as Primal Groudon while recovering from damage it has taken.</li> <li>Toxic puts Defog users such as Giratina-O and support Arceus formes on a timer, but this comes at a cost of the inability to scout moves and recover more consistently or set entry hazards.</li> <li>Protect lets Ferrothorn scout for unexpected coverage moves, such as Fire Blast from support Arceus formes, as well as scouting moves of Choice-item users like Xerneas and Yveltal. It also provides an extra turn of recovery from Leech Seed and Leftovers.</li> <li>Gyro Ball lets Ferrothorn combat Mega Gengar and Z-Geomancy Xerneas while letting it do a large chunk of damage to most neutral foes.</li> <li>Power Whip is an alternative STAB move that lets Ferrothorn check Primal Kyogre more consistently, and it has significantly more PP than Gyro Ball.</li> <li>Both said attacking moves can be used by forgoing Protect or Spikes if Ferrothorn has to act as a more offensive check to Primal Kyogre while not being passive against Mega Gengar.</li> <li>Bullet Seed is an option to consider over Power Whip, as it can allow Ferrothorn to better deal with Primal Kyogre using Substitute. Bullet Seed's higher PP than other attacking moves also allows Ferrothorn to prevent Gothorita from trapping it or at least force it to use most of its Rest's PP.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>HP and Special Defense are maximized for Ferrothorn to prevail against threats it is tasked to handle; the EV spread lets Ferrothorn take minimal damage from Primal Kyogre while being able to take two +3 Moonblast from Z-Geomancy Xerneas.</li> <li>Leftovers helps Ferrothorn recover and stay healthy throughout the match, and it synergizes well with Leech Seed.</li> <li>Iron Barbs inflict damage to foes that make contact with Ferrothorn.</li> <li>A Sassy nature and 0 Speed IVs should be run if Gyro Ball is used to maximize its Base Power.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Due to its typing and bulk, Ferrothorn is able to find ample opportunities to switch into Primal Kyogre and support Arceus formes to absorb damage and proceed to set entry hazards or spread status.</li> <li>Leech Seed must be used often to keep Ferrothorn healthy and let it continuously switch into Judgment from the likes of Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Fairy. There are not many viable Grass-types in the tier, so Ferrothorn will have an easy time consistently recovering itself while wearing down the opposing team.</li> <li>Gyro Ball should be used with care, since it has only 8 PP and depleting it early will leave Ferrothorn very passive and, more notably, vulnerable to Mega Gengar.</li> <li>Threats such as Mewtwo and Lunala that switch into Ferrothorn must be scouted with Protect to see if they carry coverage moves like Fire Blast or Focus Blast. However, it should be used with caution against potential setup sweepers like Rayquaza, since a wrong prediction will give them a free turn.</li> <li>Against the likes of Lugia, Chansey, and Zygarde-C, Ferrothorn can switch into Toxic or Glare in Zygarde-C's case. Ferrothorn can then take advantage of their high HP stats with Leech Seed and use them as Spikes fodder.</li> <li>If threats such as Primal Kyogre and Xerneas are still healthy, Ferrothorn shouldn't be recklessly switched in often, since it has to be as healthy as possible to check them.</li> <li>Ferrothorn is practically useless against teams with Mega Sableye, as anything Ferrothorn throws at it does pathetic damage, and any status moves will be bounced back. Ferrothorn should be used as fodder to lure in Mega Sableye while double switching into teammates like Xerneas, Arceus-Fairy, and Primal Groudon, all of which are naturally able to threaten or defeat Mega Sableye one-on-one.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Ferrothorn isn't enough to handle Xerneas by itself, since said threat usually carries coverage moves such as Focus Blast and Hidden Power Fire that are dedicated to hit Steel-types. Specially defensive Necrozma-DM is able to check every Geomancy Xerneas variant and set up Stealth Rock, letting Ferrothorn run Spikes. Magearna is also a reliable counter to Xerneas and is able to switch into Yveltal, which potentially threatens Ferrothorn with Taunt.</li> <li>Primal Groudon can set up Stealth Rock to form hazard stacking core with Ferrothorn and is able to handle Geomancy Xerneas that carry Hidden Power Fire or Focus Blast if Ferrothorn lacks Chople Berry. Assuming Primal Groudon healthy enough, it is able to switch into Marshadow and Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Xerneas, Mega Salamence, Arceus, and Rayquaza all massively benefit from the Spikes support Ferrothorn provides, since said hazard wears down their conventional checks in Steel-types and Arceus formes, drawing them near KO range after boosts. Mega Salamence in particular appreciates Ferrothorn's ability to switch into Ice Beam and Judgment from Arceus formes while leaving Celesteela unable to recover by using its immunity to Leech Seed.</li> <li>Primal Kyogre appreciates Ferrothorn naturally drawing in Primal Groudon and wearing it down with Spikes and Leech Seed. Ferrothorn can switch into Toxic from Arceus formes or opposing Ferrothorn to prevent recovery from Leech Seed. Primal Kyogre provides a switch-in to Fire-type moves aimed at Ferrothorn, defeats Ho-Oh, and threatens Arceus formes that carry Fire Blast.</li> <li>Ho-Oh also can act as a check to Xerneas that carry coverage moves to hit Ferrothorn while spreading status with Sacred Fire and Toxic, aiding Ferrothorn in wearing down opposing teams with residual damage.</li> <li>Zygarde-C is one of the best partners for Ferrothorn because they form a solid defensive core. Zygarde-C appreciates Ferrothorn's ability to switch into Ice Beam from support Arceus formes and use Leech Seed on Primal Groudon to make it much easier to check. In return, Zygarde-C is able to switch into Ho-Oh, Primal Groudon, Blaziken, Mega Salamence, and most physical attackers in the metagame. Dragon Tail also has significantly better use if Spikes are on the field.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy is another option to form a defensive core with Ferrothorn. While taking care of Yveltal, Rayquaza, and Mega Salamence, Arceus-Fairy is able to lure Ferrothorn's checks such as Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh and put them on timer using Toxic. Ferrothorn is able to switch into Steel-types and wear down Arceus-Fairy's checks with Spikes and Leech Seed.</li> <li>Dark-types, such as Yveltal and Arceus-Dark, are able to check Arceus-Ghost and Mega Gengar, while Ferrothorn can switch into Fairy-type attacks and use Toxic in return. The aforementioned Dark-types appreciate Ferrothorn's Spikes support, as the former forces switches often, while the latter can take advantage of Spikes and set up Calm Mind to defeat its weakened checks.</li> </ul> "

  "Reshiram": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Reshiram is known as a niche but capable check to many Steel-types in Ubers by virtue of its typing and strong STAB attacks.</li> <li>As a Fire-type special attacker, Reshiram faces extreme competition from Primal Groudon. Reshiram's neutrality to Fairy-type attacks and lacking ability in comparison to Desolate Land means that defensively, Primal Groudon completely overshadows any defensive niche Reshiram may have.</li> <li>Offensively, however, Reshiram's signature move in Blue Flare, secondary STAB move in Draco Meteor, reliable recovery in Roost, and the ability to hold Life Orb allow it to separate itself from Primal Groudon's special sets, offering more consistent damage output against neutral targets and a typically superior matchup against Arceus-Water and Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Reshiram's lacking Speed tier means that against offensive teams, it will likely be attacked first and offer very little. However, balance teams that make use of defensive Steel-types can have a hard time handling Reshiram, offering it some potent matchups.</li> <li>Ultimately, Reshiram suffers from excessive opportunity costs and a lack of unique niches to warrant a place on many Ubers teams.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Grassium Z + Solar Beam can act as a nuke against Reshiram's Water- and Rock-type checks, but this sacrifices a moveslot and item slot, limiting Reshiram's flexibility and damage output while also adding even more opportunity cost by using a Z-Move. It also requires prediction to properly hit the ideal targets, making it an unattractive option.</li> <li>Ancient Power can replace Stone Edge to 2HKO all Ho-Oh sets without accuracy concerns while adding a small chance of a raise to all stats, which will make Reshiram far more difficult to deal with. However, Ancient Power being a special attack means that using Draco Meteor beforehand will ruin its damage output against Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Tailwind can boost the Speed of Reshiram and its allies, giving Reshiram in particular a fighting chance to deal a lot of damage to offensive teams and limit the option of using a faster attacker to KO it. However, such a set has limited potential due to the low number of turns Tailwind is active and will likely lack coverage against bulkier teams.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey</strong>: Due to Reshiram being a special attacker and having a vulnerability to Toxic, it has no reasonable way to break through Chansey and Blissey, making them surefire counters.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Tyranitar, Arceus-Rock, and Mega Diancie are all very effective checks to Reshiram due to their resistance to Blue Flare. Tyranitar can handle Reshiram's STAB moves well and force damage on it with Pursuit or use Rock-type moves, while Arceus-Rock is faster and can use Recover to heal any damage from Draco Meteor. Mega Diancie can pivot into Draco Meteor easily but struggles to switch into Blue Flare. Mega Diancie's higher Speed and Diamond Storm's ability to OHKO Reshiram means that Reshiram stands little chance in a duel.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers: While Reshiram's attacks are difficult to switch into, its low Speed, average bulk, and weakness to common Ground- and Fairy-type moves mean that many faster threats in Ubers such as offensive Arceus formes, Ultra Necrozma, and Mega Salamence can dispose of Reshiram without fearing any retaliation if Stealth Rock is in play.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Primal Kyogre's ability, Primordial Sea, causes Reshiram to be hesitant about its usage of Blue Flare due to the fear of giving Primal Kyogre a free switch. Primal Kyogre does not appreciate Draco Meteor at all, however, meaning that the matchup has a lot of risks involved. In a duel, Primal Kyogre deals higher damage to Reshiram than it takes in return, meaning that if Primal Kyogre is given a safe switch, Reshiram is unfavored to come out on top. Arceus-Water is capable of switching into Blue Flare relatively easily and can either attempt to Toxic stall Reshiram or weaken it with Judgment, but it takes a large amount of damage from Draco Meteor, forcing the use of Recover and handing over a free switch or giving Reshiram the chance to get a free Toxic on Arceus-Water before switching out. Stealth Rock variants of Arceus-Water typically lack Toxic, meaning that Reshiram is actually capable of stalling Arceus-Water out with the combination of Toxic and Roost, reversing the matchup.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Arceus-Ground, Primal Groudon, and Zygarde are all capable of offensively pressuring Reshiram with their Ground-type attacks, but they struggle to handle either of Reshiram's STAB moves, limiting their ability to switch in. Arceus-Ground's higher Speed and potential usage of Recover mean that it is the most likely to be a threat, but Reshiram can 2HKO Arceus-Ground with Blue Flare. Reshiram can also survive an unboosted STAB attack from most Arceus-Ground variants if at full HP. Primal Groudon has difficulty taking either of Reshiram's STAB attacks, with Desolate Land boosting Blue Flare's damage output into a clean 2HKO, making it an offensive check at best. Defensive Zygarde has little chance against Reshiram, but Dragon Dance sets have the ability to pivot into Blue Flare at the risk of a burn or just outspeed Reshiram and OHKO it with Thousand Arrows after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh: Ho-Oh can effectively pivot around Reshiram's STAB attacks with Regenerator healing but is a key target of Reshiram's Rock-type coverage, meaning it has to be careful. Reshiram sets opting for Toxic can have a more difficult time dealing with Ho-Oh, however.</p> ",

        "name": "Life Orb",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Blue Flare is one of the biggest separators between Reshiram and special Primal Groudon sets. While Primal Groudon's Overheat can be slightly stronger, it has the big downside of dropping its Special Attack, leading to a different style of play when compared to Blue Flare's potential. Life Orb-boosted Blue Flare can outdamage Primal Groudon's Fire Blast, though.</li> <li>With this in mind, Blue Flare is a consistent high-damage STAB move without any drawbacks other than accuracy, and it is capable of achieving easy 2HKOs on maximum HP Arceus formes neutral to the attack as well as an outright OHKO on Xerneas after Stealth Rock damage.</li> <li>Draco Meteor acts as Reshiram's secondary attack, targeting many of the Pokemon capable of taking a Blue Flare such as Arceus-Water, Tyranitar, Ho-Oh, and Primal Kyogre for heavy damage.</li> <li>Roost is Reshiram's way of consistently applying pressure to the foe's Steel-type Pokemon. While Primal Groudon doesn't have the recovery to deal with Leech Seed and other residual damage from defensive Pokemon, Reshiram can remain healthy with Roost, adding another separation between the two.</li> <li>The fourth moveslot is dedicated to limiting Reshiram's checks. Toxic will wear down many of Reshiram's checks such as Arceus-Water and Tyranitar and can combine with Roost to stall for poison damage on the likes of support Arceus formes. Stone Edge will OHKO offensive Ho-Oh and, with some prior damage from the likes of Blue Flare, OHKO defensive Ho-Oh variants as well.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum Special Attack investment with a Modest nature gives Reshiram the ideal damage output for its role as a wallbreaker.</li> <li>152 Speed EVs allow Reshiram to outspeed Adamant Necrozma-DM, giving it the ability to outspeed and OHKO most offensive sets with Blue Flare.</li> <li>The rest of the EVs are put into HP to add additional bulk so Reshiram can take less damage from the weaker attacks it may switch in on. 104 HP EVs even allow Reshiram to take an Earthquake from Swords Dance Arceus-Ground sets lacking Earth Plate at full HP.</li> <li>Turboblaze generally offers little to Reshiram's offensive potential but does give it the ability to 2HKO Lugia through Multiscale with Blue Flare.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Reshiram is ideally used to punish defensive Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Magearna, and Celesteela, as well as Stealth Rock variants of Necrozma-DM, and should be used as the primary switch-in to them. This means that Reshiram's ideal matchups involve slower, bulkier teams.</li> <li>Reshiram's usage of Roost is a key reason behind using it as the primary switch-in, as it doesn't fear the residual damage from entry hazards and Leech Seed as much as Primal Groudon does. By using Reshiram for this role, Primal Groudon has fewer defensive roles to fulfill during a game and doesn't get worn down as easily.</li> <li>Reshiram should carefully manage its health when entering the field if entry hazards are up. While Reshiram doesn't necessarily need to be very healthy to force out most Steel-types, the matchup against Double Dance Necrozma-DM, Primal Kyogre, and various Arceus-Ground variants becomes far more dangerous after taking Stealth Rock damage. Roost should be used more often if Reshiram must remain at full HP during a match, but this may lead to a loss in momentum, so be wary.</li> <li>Blue Flare is one of the strongest unboosted attacks in Ubers and lacks drawbacks. Make good use of this to break down the enemy team. Draco Meteor should be used as a strong coverage move against Fire-resistant Pokemon rather than as a spammable attack.</li> <li>If opting for Toxic, Reshiram should only aim to use it in the face of its hardest checks such as Ho-Oh and support Arceus formes resistant to Fire. In most cases, Reshiram's STAB attacks will put out more offensive pressure than a simple Toxic by forcing recovery options from defensive walls.</li> <li>Reshiram can be used as an aggressive check to some offensive Necrozma-DM sets. As Reshiram is invested to be faster than Adamant variants of Necrozma-DM and can survive an unboosted Earthquake when healthy, it can be switched in on turns where it is likely Necrozma-DM will use a setup move such as Swords Dance or into Sunsteel Strike in order to force it out or OHKO it with Blue Flare. It should be stressed that this is only possible when completely healthy, as Necrozma-DM has the potential to use Rock Polish and easily take out a weakened Reshiram with Earthquake on the next turn. Stealth Rock damage in particular can lead to the aforementioned scenario.</li> <li>Reshiram's ability against offensive teams is very lacking, and it will likely rely on teammates to cover for its shortcomings in these matchups. Take any opportunity to make Reshiram useful when facing offensive teams.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Teams built around Reshiram should aim to be offensive in nature but with sufficient countermeasures against opposing offensive teams. Reshiram's main niche on a team is to offer a primary check to defensive Steel-types in place of Primal Groudon, allowing the latter to run a different set.</li> <li>This means that Primal Groudon should be used alongside Reshiram to offer any real benefits. With Reshiram around to threaten Steel-types, Primal Groudon can opt for an offensive set that utilizes Ground- and Rock-type coverage, such as Double Dance or Stealth Rock + Swords Dance. Defensively, Primal Groudon can help deal with Fairy-types and Primal Kyogre, which Reshiram cannot defensively handle or effectively duel.</li> <li>The combination of Reshiram and Primal Groudon can leave an annoying weakness to Ground-types. The rest of the team will ideally be able to cover Reshiram's matchup against opposing offensive teams while having sufficient teammates to deal with opposing Ground-types.</li> <li>Arceus-Water is the premier support Arceus forme to partner with Reshiram. It offers a reliable check to many Ground-types and an additional check to Primal Kyogre, and it can even set Stealth Rock should Primal Groudon be running an offensive set.</li> <li>Mega Salamence is another good partner that can help against opposing Ground-types, and it can either carry Defog to clear entry hazards for Reshiram or use Facade to act as a better Ho-Oh check.</li> <li>Choice Scarf Xerneas can revenge kill many common offensive Pokemon that try to revenge kill Reshiram such as Marshadow, Ultra Necrozma, and offensive Arceus formes.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM adds to the Ground-type weakness of a team, but, if this is sufficiently covered by other teammates, can partner with Reshiram to handle Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Rock-types such as Mega Diancie. In return, Reshiram can easily pressure defensive Steel-types such as Skarmory and Celesteela that try to handle Necrozma-DM. Trick Room variants of Necrozma-DM in particular offer these benefits while also doing well against offensive teams.</li> <li>Yveltal adds a Ground immunity and can use a Choice Scarf set to help Reshiram against offensive teams.</li> <li>Marshadow provides revenge killing utility against many offensive Pokemon such as Ultra Necrozma while also threatening Blissey and Rock-type Pokemon for Reshiram.</li> </ul> "

  "Zekrom": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Zekrom sets itself apart from the majority of the wallbreakers in the tier with its high base Attack of 150 and a good offensive typing of Dragon / Electric that enables it to threaten the majority of the tier.</li> <li>Thanks to these traits, Zekrom can immensely threaten defensive Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Lugia, Arceus-Water, Toxapex, and both formes of Giratina. It can also offensively check threats such as Mega Salamence, Necrozma-DM, Yveltal, Primal Kyogre, and Mega Gyarados.</li> <li>However, while Zekrom is a threatening offensive powerhouse, each of its STAB moves has no effect on certain common threats such as Primal Groudon, Xerneas, Arceus-Fairy, and Arceus-Ground. This means if Zekrom fails to successfully use its chosen STAB move, it will only end up granting a free switch to the aforementioned foes, some of which are very dangerous to hand over momentum to.</li> <li>In addition, Zekrom is mandated to hold Dragonium Z in order to wallbreak efficiently and bypass its typical Ground-type checks. Not only can this set be played around by Fairy-type foes, but it also is a questionable set to employ over more consistent or threatening Z-Move wallbreakers such as Necrozma-DM, Arceus-Ground, Zygarde-C, Rayquaza, and Naganadel.</li> <li>Even accounting for Zekrom's ability to lure and remove major Ground-types like Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground, it faces competition with Primal Kyogre, which is also an offensive powerhouse that can deal with Ground-types but is much more consistent and has much narrower counterplay.</li> <li>Zekrom's mediocre Speed tier and typing leave it weak to common types like Ice, Fairy, and Ground. Thus, it is very easily revenge killed, which is detrimental for a wallbreaker that relies on setup to efficiently KO foes.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Electrium Z may be used over Dragonium Z so Zekrom can survive a hit from Arceus-Fairy and OHKO back using +1 Gigavolt Havoc. The Z-Move also allows Zekrom to cleanly OHKO offensive variants of Necrozma-DM after Stealth Rock, but forgoing Dragonium Z makes Zekrom even weaker against Ground-types.</li> <li>Dragon Claw may be used over Outrage as a more reliable physical Dragon STAB move, but this significantly reduces Zekrom's ability to execute otherwise powerful Devastating Drake and makes it unable to KO Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>A set employing Life Orb, Draco Meteor, and Tailwind lets Zekrom function much better against offensive teams, but this set suffers from a difficulty to set up Tailwind and worsened matchup against bulkier teams.</li> <li>A Choice Scarf set might be appealing and is able to take advantage of Zekrom's strong STAB moves, let Zekrom overcome its middling Speed tier, and generate momentum with Volt Switch. However, being locked into any STAB move ends up giving a free switch to Ground- and Fairy-types, depending on which move Zekrom is locked into. Due to this, Choice Scarf Zekrom ends up causing a loss of momentum. As a revenge killer, other faster Choice Scarf users such as Xerneas and Yveltal outclass it in this role; the former is much better at forcing switches and has access to utility moves like Aromatherapy, and the latter can pivot out of its check with U-turn.</li> <li>Shuca Berry allows Zekrom to survive Ground-type moves and notably lets it offensively check Necrozma-DM, but this leave Zekrom helpless against Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: Primal Groudon is the most commonly seen threat in the tier and, simply by its presence, discourages Zekrom from using Bolt Strike and forces it to lock itself into Outrage. Although it is KOed by +1 Devastating Drake, it easily forces out Zekrom and proceeds to set hazards or sweep depending on the variant. Arceus-Ground outspeeds Zekrom and threatens it with a super effective Judgment, though it is dangerous to take on Zekrom at full HP due to the threat of +1 Devastating Drake. Excadrill can easily take unboosted moves from Zekrom due to its typing and threatens back with STAB Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Although all of them are 2HKOed by Bolt Strike, Arceus-Fairy, Xerneas, Magearna, and Mega Diancie can threaten Zekrom with their STAB moves and potentially switch into a predicted Devastating Drake, forcing Zekrom into playing mind games. Arceus-Fairy in particular is troublesome due to it outspeeding Zekrom and having access to recovery, but its efficiency as a check can be significantly diminished by paralysis from Bolt Strike.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers: Zekrom's average Speed tier and common weaknesses to Fairy, Ground, and Ice leave it susceptible to most faster attackers in the tier. Arceus formes with appropriate typing can easily take out Zekrom with a super effective Judgment after Stealth Rock. Fast and powerful attackers such as Mega Gengar, Mega Lucario, and Mewtwo can revenge kill Zekrom after it has been weakened. Marshadow in particular is troublesome to deal with when it has switched in after Zekrom has KOed a foe with a boosted attack.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn: Ferrothorn comfortably takes on Zekrom thanks to its typing that lets it resist both of Zekrom's STAB moves. However, Ferrothorn finds itself being set up on Zekrom with Substitute, though Zekrom still has to take major damage from Iron Barbs while combating it.</p> <p><strong>Lunala</strong>: Lunala outspeeds Zekrom and can take even a boosted hit thanks to Shadow Shield. In return, Lunala can 2HKO Zekrom with Moongeist Beam or Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Dialga</strong>: Due to its unique typing and bulk, Dialga can easily handle Bolt Strike, survive +1 Outrage, and OHKO back using Draco Meteor. However, it falls to +1 Devastating Drake.</p> <p><strong>Coverage Moves</strong>: Popular coverage moves, such as Ice Beam, which is very common among support Arceus formes, and Earthquake, which is often run by physical Primal Kyogre, Rayquaza, and Ultra Necrozma, hit Zekrom super effectively and thus leave it vulnerable to revenge killing. Zekrom is also vulnerable to Draco Meteor from some variants of Rayquaza.</p> <p><strong>Status: Toxic puts Zekrom on timer and forces it to heavily rely on predictions to dish out as much damage as possible while an opponent can stall it out by switching between Ground- and Fairy-types. Burn hampers Zekrom by halving its Attack stat, leaving it unable to do meaningful damage to any foe at all.</p> ",

        "name": "Hone Claws",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Hone Claws increases Zekrom's already great damage output, letting it OHKO bulky walls such as Lugia, offensive Necrozma-DM, and Magearna after a boost, as well as making Bolt Strike a perfectly accurate move.</li> <li>Bolt Strike is Zekrom's strongest STAB move and inflicts massive damage on neutral foes, notably achieving a 2HKO on fast support Arceus forms formes.

Another notable benefit of Substitute is that Zekrom can use defensive Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn as setup fodder.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>The given EV spread allows Zekrom to avoid the OHKO from Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Fairy's Judgment, the OHKO from Mega Salamence's Earthquake after Stealth Rock, and the 2HKO from support Arceus formes' Ice Beam while letting Zekrom outspeed Adamant Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Maximum investment on Attack with an Adamant nature maximizes Zekrom's damage output, letting it 2HKO certain Arceus formes with Bolt Strike.</li> <li>Dragonium Z allows Zekrom to use Devastating Drake so it can use a Dragon-type STAB move without locking itself into Outrage.</li> <li>Teravolt is Zekrom's only legal ability and notably allows it to hit Lugia through Multiscale and KO the occasional Skarmory through Sturdy. Bear in mind that this ability does not ignore Lunala's Shadow Shield.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Due to its horrendous matchup against faster threats, Zekrom is best used as a wallbreaker that paves the way for its teammates to sweep by disposing of major threats such as Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, Ho-Oh, and Zygarde-C.</li> <li>Zekrom possesses good natural bulk and offensively checks a number of threats by its typing, but it should generally avoid switching into attacks due to its exploitable weakness to common coverage moves such as Ice Beam from support Arceus formes and status move severely crippling it. Pivoting via U-turn and Volt Switch and double switching are the most ideal ways for Zekrom to switch in.</li> <li>Despite the fact that Zekrom has a way to lure and remove Ground-types, such foes usually limit Zekrom's offensive capabilities, as they discourage the use of Bolt Strike and force Zekrom to make flawless predictions with setting Hone Claws on their switch. This means one's prediction is going to determine Zekrom's performance against practically any team due to the abundance of Primal Groudon, and this becomes more of a serious matter against team with Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>When given an opportunity to switch in, it is important to decide whether to attack or set up Hone Claws; due to the prevalence of Ground- and Fairy-types on most teams, Zekrom will most likely struggle to inflict much damage without having them weakened or eliminated.</li> <li>Early-game, Zekrom can pressure the opposing team with strong Bolt Strikes and potentially spread paralysis so it will have the upper hand against paralyzed foes later.</li> <li>If Ground-types such as Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground are likely going to switch in, setting up Hone Claws is a promising idea, as a healthy Zekrom can survive a hit from the latter and OHKO back with boosted Devastating Drake. In order for this to be successful, avoid taking any form of damage so Zekrom can successfully lure Arceus-Ground, survive a Judgment, and score a KO.</li> <li>If Zekrom is boosted, and if there are Fairy-types present on the opposing team, use Substitute to ease predictions with your Z-Move, as they can make Zekrom's opportunity to wallbreak go to waste simply by switching in.</li> <li>In an event where Zekrom has no opportunity to set up Hone Claws, unboosted Devastating Drake can still be used to significantly weaken threats like Primal Groudon and most neutral targets so that Zekrom's teammates, such as Primal Kyogre and Xerneas, can have easier time dealing with them.</li> <li>Zekrom can take more offensive approaches to dish out damage against slower and defensive teams. It can be sent out early to threaten certain bulky foes such as Lugia, Ho-Oh, and Skarmory and set Substitute to avoid status while easing predictions with Devastating Drake.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Zekrom's objective is to rid the opposing team of threatening foes such as Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground so its teammates can function more effectively. Teammates that appreciate the disposal of such foes can fit alongside Zekrom.</li> <li>Offensive powerhouses such as Primal Kyogre, Marshadow, and Ho-Oh vastly appreciate Zekrom disposing of Primal Groudon with a powerful Devastating Drake. Setup sweepers that appreciate the removal of Primal Groudon, such as Xerneas, Arceus, and Necrozma-DM, appreciate this as well. In return, Zekrom checks Ho-Oh and Lugia, which can otherwise be nuisances to deal with for certain mentioned teammates.</li> <li>Entry hazards allow Zekrom to score the OHKO on defensive Primal Groudon with Devastating Drake and 2HKO on support Arceus formes with Bolt Strike. Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM can set such entry hazards while checking Fairy-types and hindering support Arceus formes with Toxic. On more offensive teams, Deoxys-S, Excadrill, and Cloyster can set hazards for Zekrom.</li> <li>Despite the fact that Zekrom can KO Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground with a boosted Z-Move, it is advised to acquire a check for them, as luring and KOing them require predictions. Arceus-Water is a solid check to both of the threats and appreciates Zekrom taking advantage of defensive Necrozma-DM and Toxapex. Giratina-O, although it stacks weaknesses with Zekrom, is one of the more offensive checks to Primal Groudon and can provide better setup opportunities for Zekrom by weakening a foe with Will-O-Wisp.</li> <li>Arceus-Ground serves as a solid offensive check to Primal Groudon, and Calm Mind variants in particular appreciate Zekrom's ability to deal with most of its checks like Ho-Oh, Primal Kyogre, and Celesteela.</li> <li>Mega Salamence is a good teammate that provides an immunity to Ground, and it benefits from Zekrom's ability to threaten Arceus-Water and Toxapex, immensely pressure Arceus-Fairy, and potentially lure and eliminate Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>Ho-Oh is a solid check to Fairy-types, support Arceus-Ground, and Primal Groudon without a Rock-type move. It also appreciates Zekrom's ability to offensively check Water-types.</li> <li>Steel-types generally tend to pair well with Zekrom, as they can switch into Toxic and Ice-type moves while checking Fairy-types. Zekrom threatens Ho-Oh and can get rid of Primal Groudon, both of which are massive threats to Steel-types. Mega Scizor and Magearna can bring in Zekrom safely with U-turn and Volt Switch, Ferrothorn can set Spikes and wear down Arceus formes with Leech Seed and Toxic, and Celesteela can aid Zekrom in the same way and also provides Ground immunity. Offensive Necrozma-DM appreciates Zekrom threatening Yveltal and Ho-Oh while eliminating one of its greatest checks, Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Mega Gengar can trap and remove Fairy-types, which are one of the biggest problems for Zekrom to deal with, so Zekrom can use Devastating Drake without much concern. In return, Zekrom has the ability to remove Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Yveltal, all of which Mega Gengar struggles to beat.</li> <li>Yveltal pressures most physical walls in the tier with strong attacks and can potentially provide a setup opportunity for Zekrom by crippling a passive foe with Taunt. Variants with U-turn can also bring in Zekrom safely.</li> <li>Sticky Web is an interesting option that lets Zekrom overcome its rather mediocre Speed tier and threaten faster foes that it otherwise struggles against. Smeargle can set Sticky Web so Zekrom will outspeed most grounded foes, and Zekrom pressures most Defog users with its STAB moves and offensively checks Yveltal and Mega Salamence, both of which are serious problems for Sticky Web teams to deal with.</li> </ul> "

The latter can also burn Zekrom with Sacred Fire, which significantly hampers its offensive presence.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Physically defensive Zekrom can fit on teams that require a switch-in to threatening foes like Mega Salamence, Ho-Oh, and Primal Kyogre that still retains some degree of offensive presence.</li> <li>As this variant of Zekrom is helpless against Ground-types apart from putting them on timer using Toxic, teammates that can pivot into Ground-types are mandatory. Ho-Oh is a solid check to support variants of Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground and threatens problematic Steel-types like Ferrothorn. Skarmory is a solid check to Arceus-Ground and provides Spikes support, which helps Zekrom wear down its checks quickly in tandem with Dragon Tail.</li> <li>As this set is not that great of a check to Primal Kyogre, it is advised for one to acquire checks for it. Primal Groudon is one of the more solid pivots for Primal Kyogre, an offensive check to Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn, and a Stealth Rock setter that Zekrom can take advantage of with Dragon Tail. Ferrothorn is a safe switch-in to Primal Kyogre and can aid Zekrom in a similar way as Skarmory.</li> <li>Mega Salamence checks Primal Groudon, and it appreciates Zekrom's ability to hinder support Arceus formes with Toxic or even paralysis induced from Bolt Strike.</li> <li>Arceus-Ground is another offensive check to Primal Groudon and can provide Defog support if running the support set. Arceus-Ground in general appreciates Zekrom's ability to threaten most foes that are airborne.</li> <li>Arceus-Fairy appreciates Zekrom's ability to threaten foes such as Ho-Oh and Toxapex and pressure Necrozma-DM. In return, it can provide Stealth Rock support and check Dragon-types like Rayquaza and Giratina-O.</li> <li>Xerneas benefits from Zekrom for the same reasons, and it can provide cleric support through Aromatherapy and let Zekrom more reliably take on foes it checks, such as Ho-Oh and Arceus-Water.</li> </ul> "

  "Landorus": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Landorus is a powerful wallbreaker that causes problems for nearly all defensive cores in the tier. With Life Orb- and Sheer Force-boosted attacks, it is capable of easily OHKOing bulky foes, such as Primal Groudon, offensive Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, and Toxapex.</li> <li>Access to a wide array of coverage moves makes Landorus harder to defensively handle. Landorus's ability to harshly punish common Ground-immune Pokemon with Hidden Power Ice and Sheer Force-boosted Rock Slide makes it considerably difficult for many teams to switch into.</li> <li>A unique Speed tier lets Landorus outpace common foes, such as Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Xerneas, and Yveltal. This lets Landorus viably run a Rash nature to make its attacks even more powerful.</li> <li>Landorus's ability to force many switches, pressure Defog Arceus formes, and threaten common Stealth Rock setters like Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM gives it a solid role compression as a wallbreaker and Stealth Rock setter.</li> <li>However, Landorus is relatively frail, and it doesn't have any notable resistances and immunities apart from being immune to Ground. Even this cannot be properly taken advantage of due to Ground-types like Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground being able to OHKO Landorus on the switch.</li> <li>Landorus's frailty and lack of useful resistances leave it vulnerable to essentially every faster foe, such as support Arceus formes, Mega Salamence, Mega Lucario, and every Choice Scarf user. This makes it very hard for Landorus to function against any offensive teams.</li> <li>These detrimental factors leave Landorus hard to justify and overshadowed by other strong attackers like Rayquaza, Lunala, and Mewtwo; the former two have much more spammable STAB moves and perform much better against offensive teams, while the latter has a significantly better Speed tier and even wider options for coverage moves.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Focus Blast allows Landorus to 2HKO Ferrothorn, Celesteela, and Skarmory while doing the same to Chansey once Eviolite has been removed.</li> <li>Sludge Wave gives Rash Landorus a chance to take out Geomancy Xerneas after Stealth Rock damage but has almost no relevant use outsides of this.</li> <li>Gravity allows Landorus to temporarily hit Flying-types with Earth Power, but this relies on a forced switch to be set up and also leaves Landorus and its teammates vulnerable to Ground-type moves, which can be detrimental against threats like Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>Landorus has access to setup moves such as Calm Mind and Rock Polish. The former might be an appealing option that boosts Landorus's sheer power to even further levels, but it isn't efficient due to Landorus having to run a mixed moveset to effectively wallbreak. The latter boosts Landorus's Speed and potentially allows it to clean up late-game, but this is simply outclassed by other setup sweepers like Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Foes</strong>: Landorus's poor bulk leaves it vulnerable to most faster threats in the tier. Most support Arceus formes, although they are 2HKOed by Earth Power, naturally outspeed Landorus, have access to Recover to keep themselves healthy, and commonly employ Ice Beam, which can easily dispose of Landorus. Mega Salamence, Marshadow, Deoxys-A, Mewtwo, and Ultra Necrozma can outspeed and OHKO Landorus. Choice Scarf users such as Xerneas and Yveltal can easily KO Landorus after some prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Lugia: Thanks to its massive bulk that is further complemented by Multiscale and an immunity to Earth Power, Lugia can switch into Landorus with impunity and threaten to KO back with Ice Beam or set Landorus on timer using Toxic. It is quite hindered by a well-timed Knock Off, however.</p> <p><strong>Giratina-O</strong>: Giratina-O's great defensive stats and Levitate allow it to switch into most of Landorus's moves, and even Knock Off fails to do much damage due to Griseous Orb. However, it is susceptible to residual damage and is 3HKOed by Hidden Power Ice, so it cannot consistently switch into Landorus.</p> <p><strong>Ground-immune Steel-types</strong>: Celesteela, Skarmory, and the rare Bronzong are immune to Earth Power and take at most neutral damage from Rock Slide. However, none of them appreciate losing their items to Knock Off, and the former two are 2HKOed by Focus Blast.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Foes: Defensive Primal Kyogre is not 2HKOed by Earth Power and can OHKO back using Scald or Ice Beam. Chansey and Blissey, although they are greatly hindered by Knock Off and dislike Focus Blast, can otherwise comfortably take on Landorus.</p> ",

It notably reaches a guaranteed OHKO on defensive Primal Groudon, offensive Necrozma-DM, and Toxapex.</li> <li>Rock Slide is another Sheer Force-boosted move that punishes Flying-types such as Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Rayquaza that are immune to Earth Power by OHKOing or 2HKOing them.</li> <li>Landorus can take advantage of its ability to pressure many Defog users and common entry hazard setters to viably use Stealth Rock. Landorus's ability to effectively use Stealth Rock and function as a wallbreaker sets it apart from other wallbreakers in the tier.</li> <li>Knock Off hinders walls that can handle both Earth Power and Rock Slide, such as Lugia, Chansey, Blissey, Celesteela, and Skarmory. The move also has benefits of removing items such as Leftovers, Eviolite, and Shed Shell from said switch-ins.</li> <li>Hidden Power Ice OHKOes Rayquaza and Mega Salamence and 2HKOes Zygarde-C. It also 3HKOes Giratina-O, which takes all of Landorus's other moves with ease.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed allows Landorus to take advantage of its Speed tier and outspeed every foe with base 100 Speed while maintaining as much offensive potential as possible.</li> <li>A Rash nature allows Landorus to have enough power to outright OHKO Primal Groudon, offensive Necrozma-DM, and Magearna and 2HKO support Arceus formes with Earth Power while outspeeding neutral-natured Xerneas and Yveltal.</li> <li>A Naive nature is an alternative option that trades Landorus's damage output for the ability to outspeed maximum Speed Xerneas, Yveltal, and Rayquaza.</li> <li>Life Orb allows Landorus to utilize Earth Power and Rock Slide with Sheer Force without taking recoil damage while boosting coverage moves such as Knock Off and Hidden Power Ice.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Landorus is best suited for disrupting defensive cores with strong Earth Powers and various coverage moves. It can thus be used early to pressure foes and set Stealth Rock on forced switch.</li> <li>It's difficult to switch Landorus into any sort of attacks due to its frailty, so it is strongly advised to switch it in through pivoting or an aggressive double switch.</li> <li>If Landorus opted for Stealth Rock, pay attention to the opposing team and figure out which Pokemon have a chance to carry Defog. While Landorus can pressure Defog users like Arceus formes and practically most Flying-types, it tends to struggle doing much against the likes of Giratina-O, Lugia, and Skarmory. Therefore, it is better to weaken or eliminate them so Landorus can effectively set Stealth Rock and keep it on the opposing field.</li> <li>On the other hand, if Landorus opted for Knock Off, it can be a more potent wallbreaker that hinders its checks like Lugia and Chansey by removing their items. Since opponents have tendencies to switch Flying-types like Lugia and Celesteela and special walls like Chansey and Blissey into Landorus, it is better to use Knock Off early instead of recklessly spamming Earth Power so Landorus or its teammates can deal with them easier.</li> <li>Landorus takes Life Orb recoil from every use of Knock Off and Hidden Power Ice and thus should use them with care, or it will unnecessarily wear itself down over the match.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Landorus serves as a powerful wallbreaker that can disrupt defensive teams relatively well; therefore, it fits well on teams that can benefit from weakened or hindered walls.</li> <li>Primal Groudon can opt to run more offensive sets if Landorus has Stealth Rock. In exchange, Primal Groudon can switch into Primal Kyogre and threaten Ground-immune Steel-types. Variants with Toxic can lure in Lugia, support Arceus formes, and Giratina-O and put them on a timer. Should Landorus forgo Stealth Rock, Arceus-Fairy is an effective option that checks Marshadow and Yveltal, and it can also threaten Giratina-O.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM can take advantage of Landorus's defensive checks such as numerous Arceus formes and Chansey. Offensive variants can set up on foes like Arceus-Water and Celesteela, while defensive variants can run Stealth Rock to let Landorus run Knock Off and maximize its wallbreaking potency. Defensive Necrozma-DM also serves as a consistent switch-in to Arceus formes, which are Landorus's common switch-ins.</li> <li>Various Arceus formes provide Landorus with a shelter from attacks. Most of them are capable of checking faster foes like Mega Lucario thanks to their Speed and Mega Salamence if carrying Ice Beam. Arceus-Water in particular proves to be a solid partner thanks to its ability to handle problematic foes like Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>Yveltal pressures Lugia and Giratina-O and draws in Magearna and Tyranitar, which Landorus can take advantage of. Variants with U-turn can bring Landorus in safely. Mega Scizor and Magearna can also serve as pivots that can bring Landorus in safely while additionally checking Fairy-types and switching into Toxic.</li> <li>Mega Gengar appreciates the presence of a strong wallbreaker that threatens bulky foes such as Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, Magearna, and Tyranitar, all of which it would otherwise struggle against. Landorus also rids Blissey and Skarmory of Shed Shell and allows Mega Gengar to trap and remove them. In return, Mega Gengar can trap Lugia and certain Arceus formes, depending on their typing, or force a trade with an offensive threat that Landorus struggles to deal with by using Destiny Bond.</li> <li>Setup sweepers such as Geomancy Xerneas, Swords Dance Arceus, and Mega Lucario appreciate Landorus setting Stealth Rock and putting massive holes in the opposing team. Xerneas appreciates Landorus threatening Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Magearna while removing Chansey's Eviolite with Knock Off, leaving it unable to check Xerneas later in the match. Swords Dance Arceus can pick on weakened teams with ease with boosted Extreme Speed and can take advantage of Celesteela, Chansey, and other passive defensive Pokemon if using Substitute. Mega Lucario switches into Toxic from the likes of Lugia, Celesteela, and Chansey and uses the latter two as a setup fodder while threatening Ferrothorn.</li> <li>Marshadow greatly appreciates Landorus threatening Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Toxapex. It can also potentially use different sets, since Landorus has a tool that Marshadow will otherwise need, such as Hidden Power Ice and a Rock-type move. Marshadium Z variants especially do an excellent job taking out support Arceus formes, Giratina-O, and Lugia for Landorus. Marshadow in general appreciates Landorus's high damage against defensive cores and Stealth Rock support.</li> <li>Especially if Landorus opted for a Rash nature, Sticky Web is a strategy that can be employed. If said entry hazard is set up, Landorus becomes an even greater threat that can threaten support Arceus formes with Defog by potentially 2HKOing them with Earth Power. Due to Landorus's inability to threaten Defog users such as Giratina-Oand Lugia, Taunt users such as Yveltal and Mewtwo can fit alongside it in this strategy.</li> </ul> "

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Kyurem-W is one of the most powerful wallbreakers in the tier, as base 170 Special Attack backed up by Life Orb or Choice Specs allows it to OHKO or 2HKO almost everything in the metagame.</li> <li>Powerful Ice- and Dragon-type STAB moves in Ice Beam and Draco Meteor and solid coverage options such as Fusion Flare provide Kyurem-W with excellent coverage, leaving Chansey, Blissey, and bulky Water-types as its only safe switch-ins in the entire metagame.</li> <li>While Kyurem-W is fairly slow at base 95 Speed, with full investment it can outspeed crucial Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and Necrozma-DM, and it can outspeed prominent sets on more offensive Pokemon such as Geomancy Xerneas and neutral-natured Yveltal.</li> <li>However, Kyurem-W has several weaknesses that restrict it as a wallbreaker. Kyurem-W has a terrible defensive typing and must preserve its health if it is to check faster Pokemon, so it lends almost no defensive utility to any team and is hard to bring in without dedicating it precious free switches.</li> <li>Its mediocre Speed and typing also make it incredibly vulnerable to fast revenge killers, notably Marshadow, Deoxys-A, Choice Scarf Xerneas, Yveltal, Mega Salamence, Mega Lucario, and Mega Gengar, each of which commonly carries moves that can OHKO Kyurem-W after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Since Kyurem-W is so easily forced out, it is extremely prediction reliant, so its incredible power and coverage achieve results very inconsistently.</li> <li>A Stealth Rock weakness and possible Life Orb recoil mean Kyurem-W is very easily worn down throughout a match and requires Defog support to be effective.</li> <li>Finally, its reliance on Draco Meteor leaves its team vulnerable to devastating sweepers such as Necrozma-DM and Geomancy Xerneas following the Special Attack drop.</li> <li>Overall, Kyurem-W is very seldom used due to the ridiculous amount of team support it requires to be effective. On teams that can provide that support, however, its sheer power is almost unparalleled in the tier.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Most of Kyurem-W's effective options provide it with a bit more coverage to handle specific threats.</li> <li>Although it is useless against anything else, Stone Edge with a Naive nature can be used to threaten Ho-Oh, which can otherwise switch into Kyurem-W comfortably.</li> <li>Focus Blast can be used to better check Extreme Killer Arceus and Arceus-Dark. However, these Pokemon are not common enough to warrant such a coverage slot. Furthermore, Chople Berry Arceus sets are commonly used to check Marshadow, making Focus Blast ineffective in this matchup, and being Choice-locked into Focus Blast leaves Kyurem-W at the mercy of every trapper in the tier.</li> <li>Toxic can be used to cripple a wall that switches in, but the only relevant targets that wouldn't be more significantly hampered by other moves are Ho-Oh and Arceus-Water.</li> <li>While a Choice Scarf set can seem promising due to Kyurem-W's average Speed and high power, it checks nothing that Choice Scarf Lunala doesn't while having far inferior bulk and typing, making it outclassed in this role.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: All relevant Fairy-types can check Kyurem-W when healthy. Both Choice Scarf and Choice Specs Xerneas outspeed and OHKO Kyurem-W, and Geomancy Xerneas can set up with full HP on a Choice-locked Draco Meteor. Arceus-Fairy can outspeed Kyurem-W and threaten it with STAB Judgment or set up Stealth Rock</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers: Pokemon such as Marshadow, Ultra Necrozma, Choice Scarf Lunala, Mega Gengar, Mega Lucario, Mega Salamence, Deoxys-A, and Mewtwo formes can all outspeed Kyurem-W and revenge kill it easily.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Bulky Water-types such as Arceus-Water and RestTalk Primal Kyogre are among the few Pokemon that can reliably counter Kyurem-W by switching in. The only attack that can hit them meaningfully is Draco Meteor, which they can just heal off the damage from and force Kyurem-W to switch. If these Pokemon are still healthy, it is generally a good idea to not send out Kyurem-W.</p> <p><strong>Arceus formes: Most Arceus formes can check Kyurem-W if they are healthy. Offensive Arceus formes such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Arceus-Dark have the advantage over Kyurem-W after one boost. Many support Arceus formes can either stall out Kyurem with Toxic like Arceus-Water or threaten it with super effective Judgment like Arceus-Dragon and Arceus-Fairy. However, none of them enjoy switching into a neutral STAB move from Kyurem-W, as they are forced to use Recover and thus gain no momentum.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey: Kyurem-W can achieve nothing against Chansey and Blissey to the point that sending it out will just give the opponent free turns with them.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Unless Stone Edge is run or Stealth Rock is up, Ho-Oh can repeatedly switch into any of Kyurem-W's attacks and force it out while healing with Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Bulky Steel-types such as Necrozma-DM, Aegislash, Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, and Magearna threaten to OHKO or 2HKO Kyurem-W with super effective STAB moves, although none of them can switch into Fusion Flare or Earth Power. Offensive Steel-types such as Mega Lucario and Mega Metagross effectively check Kyurem-W by threatening to OHKO with their STAB moves.</p> ",

It also hits Primal Groudon harder than Ice Beam while still threatening Steel-types, which eases prediction, making it especially useful on a Choice Specs set.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment help Kyurem-W perform its role as a wallbreaker effectively.</li> <li>A Timid nature allows Kyurem-W to outspeed prominent Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Geomancy Xerneas, and neutral-natured Yveltal and Speed tie with Rayquaza. While a Modest nature provides a notable boost in power, these matchups are common enough that it should not be used except on teams that can confidently switch into these threats.</li> <li>The decision between Life Orb and Choice Specs presents a significant trade-off. Life Orb allows Kyurem-W to avoid being taken advantage of by slower Steel- and Fairy-types that are neutrally hit by or resistant to some of its moves, which is particularly valuable given the popularity of Necrozma-DM.

However, it notably does not allow Kyurem-W to hit through Shadow Shield or Prism Armor.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Kyurem-W should be brought in on almost every free switch against most teams, since its massive power makes it incredibly difficult to switch into, and it can be hard to bring in otherwise.</li> <li>Making risky predictions can be very tempting early-game, but a play that risks losing Kyurem-W is usually only a wise choice if Kyurem-W has a bad matchup or the match is going badly.</li> <li>Kyurem-W is incredibly easy to take advantage of after using Draco Meteor, so the move should generally be used only to break more annoying walls such as a weakened Arceus-Water.</li> <li>Kyurem-W can scare out some faster Pokemon such as Arceus-Ground, Yveltal, and Mega Gengar if it has enough health, so play carefully, and avoid Stealth Rock damage if such Pokemon are on the opposing team.</li> <li>Be conscious of matchup when using Kyurem-W. It is usually worth keeping alive for late-game against stall teams, which often rely on a single role-compressed wall to handle low-usage attackers such as Kyurem-W. Against balance and bulky offense, Kyurem-W's workable speed and power allow it to take advantage of bulky Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, and these teams seldom have a safe switch-in to Kyurem-W, making it a solid early- and mid-game wallbreaker.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Kyurem-W's great power is kept in check largely by its several defensive weaknesses, so it requires extensive team support to be able to work effectively.</li> <li>Kyurem-W invites a large weakness to Fairy-types such as Xerneas, so offensive checks like Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh are generally insufficient. A solid switch-in for these Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM, Mega Scizor, or Magearna is essential to stop potential sweeps. Mega Scizor and Magearna deserve a particular mention for their ability to respectively provide slow U-turns and Volt Switches for Kyurem-W, which can take advantage of them more than almost anything else in the tier.</li> <li>Kyurem-W needs entry hazard control, a role that support Arceus formes and Giratina-O can generally handle effectively, to be effective against most teams. In more offensively inclined teams, Choice Scarf Yveltal and Xerneas can effectively fill this role.</li> <li>Stealth Rock support is essential for Kyurem-W to stand a chance against the likes of Ho-Oh and Arceus-Water, so setters such as Primal Groudon, Arceus-Fairy, Necrozma-DM and Dialga are valuable partners.</li> <li>Kyurem-W also appreciates being paired with sweepers such as Mega Lucario, Mega Salamence, and Xerneas that value its ability to weaken shared checks such as Magearna, Arceus-Water, and Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Gothitelle is also a useful partner, as it can trap some of Kyurem-W's most reliable switch-ins such as Chansey and defensive Arceus formes. This combination is effective against defensive teams, although running two Pokemon with no defensive utility is difficult to compensate for when teambuilding.</li> <li>If case Kyurem-W uses Draco Meteor or is locked into the wrong move, sweepers can take advantage of it to set up. A revenge killer that can deal with them, such as Choice Scarf Yveltal or Marshadow, makes for a good teammate.</li> <li>Alternatively, offensive teams built around Sticky Web can try to rely on momentum to prevent the opponent from effectively taking advantage of Kyurem-W's weaknesses. Timid Kyurem-W outspeeds almost the entire tier under Sticky Web, including the likes of Deoxys-A and Pheromosa, making it extremely difficult to revenge kill. As such, Kyurem-W appreciates being partnered with Sticky Web setters such as Shuckle and Smeargle. Sticky Web teams are usually at an advantage against offense archetypes but struggle greatly with defensive teams, so a powerful wallbreaker like Kyurem-W goes a long way to improving this matchup.</li> </ul> "

  "Genesect": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Genesect, like many Steel-types, struggles to justify its place on many teams due to an extreme level of competition it faces with better Steel-types. Its nearly unparalleled movepool and ability to run multiple offensive sets are not sufficient to make Genesect worth using due to its unreliability as a check to Xerneas and inconsistent damage output that is reliant on Download.</li> <li>Genesect requires its team to have extra security against Xerneas as well as other common threats like Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh that can pivot into Genesect. Burdening the team to deal with these threats further diminishes Genesect's viability as an offensive Pokemon and decreases the number of sets that Genesect can opt to use to benefit its teammates in return.</li> <li>As a pivot, Genesect can force switches quite well and thus function as an offensive pivot, but it lacks much damage output against defensive teams without a beneficial Download boost and a boosting item despite the multiple coverage moves it can run, while running dedicated sets that aim to wallbreak will make it helpless against offensive teams due to its middling Speed and bulk.</li> <li>Many Pokemon in Ubers can pose immediate danger to Genesect once it makes a single misprediction. All of these negatives combine to invalidate all of Genesect's sets other than Choice Band, which it can run in an attempt to improve its role as a pivot by strengthening U-turn to punish switches harder, justify Extreme Speed to maintain its usefulness against offensive teams, and OHKO Xerneas in a one-on-one situation after Stealth Rock damage without relying on Download.</li> <li>Even a pivoting set using Choice Band faces competition with other pivots like Mega Scizor and Magearna. Mega Scizor has a much better chance to take on Geomancy Xerneas and its access to recovery enables it to switch into support Arceus formes as well, while Magearna, though it may suffer from its inability to pivot against Ground-types, is one of the best checks to Xerneas and checks other dangerous Pokemon like Yveltal.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Genesect has an incredible movepool with coverage moves that it can theoretically use to improve its matchup against almost the entirety of the tier. However, any special coverage move will need a favorable boost from Download to be effective, and special variants of Genesect holding items like Choice Specs or a Z-Crystal are less effective as a pivot due to U-turn's significantly lower damage output, meaning it will mostly be forced to make a correct prediction unlike when it holds a Choice Band and can justify using U-turn more freely when predictions become difficult.</li> <li>Ice Beam can pressure Giratina-O and OHKO Zygarde and Mega Salamence, and Flamethrower or Blaze Kick can break through Steel-types more quickly. These moves, unfortunately, cannot be justified on the Choice Band set, as they often end up being additional dangerous moves to be locked into.</li> <li>A Choice Scarf set can make Genesect an effective revenge killer against offensive teams, but it is extremely reliant on Download to take down bulky foes and struggles to punish its checks due to its weak U-turn.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh's heavy resistance to U-turn, resistance to Iron Head, Regenerator, and ability to OHKO Genesect with Sacred Fire make it an effective switch-in to Genesect that forces it to sacrifice itself with Explosion to KO Ho-Oh.</p> <p><strong>Toxapex</strong>: Toxapex is a good switch-in to Genesect for similar reasons as Ho-Oh, and it can punish Genesect with Rocky Helmet damage while also setting Toxic Spikes to cripple Genesect's team.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: While it does not boast Ho-Oh's level of longevity and is also vulnerable to a well-timed Explosion from Genesect, Primal Groudon can easily switch into Genesect for similar reasons as Ho-Oh and set Stealth Rock, spread status, or throw a heavy blow at the switch-in.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: All of Genesect's most common moves are resisted by Steel, giving it a hard time beating Steel-types on its own and forcing it to pivot into teammates that can beat them with U-turn. Specific Steel-types like Skarmory and Celesteela are more problematic due to their high physical bulk and access to recovery.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Ghost-types resist U-turn, can exploit Genesect locked into Extreme Speed, and can even switch into Explosion, making Genesect's attempt to take down a foe with itself go to a complete waste. Prominent Ghost-types like Mega Gengar, Marshadow, and Giratina-O dislike being hit by Iron Head upon switching in, however.</p> <p><strong>Faster Foes: Genesect's rather poor bulk leaves it vulnerable to getting revenge killed by faster foes like Mega Gengar, offensive Arceus formes, and Choice Scarf users like Yveltal.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>U-turn allows Genesect to generate momentum and pivot out of unfavorable matchups against threats it draws in. With Choice Band and an Attack boost from Download, U-turn becomes powerful enough to OHKO offensive Primal Kyogre and deals a decent amount of damage even to some resisted foes.</li> <li>Iron Head threatens Fairy-types and can outright OHKO Choice Scarf Xerneas while having a good chance to remove Geomancy Xerneas after Stealth Rock damage.</li> <li>Extreme Speed gives Genesect valuable utility in revenge killing, and it does sufficient damage to pick off weakened, faster foes at reasonable health thanks to Choice Band and Download.</li> <li>While Explosion results in Genesect's removal, it can be used to take down a persistent switch-in and maintain momentum. Explosion is one of the few ways Genesect can take down Ho-Oh without relying on Stealth Rock and is strong enough to have a chance to OHKO Mild Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock damage and, with an Attack boost from Download, can even outright remove a defensive variant. Choice Band-boosted Explosion with the appropriate Download boost can also outright OHKO maximum HP support Arceus formes.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>The given EV spread is optimal for Genesect's role, maximizing its damage output and Speed as a physical pivot holding a Choice Band.</li> <li>Genesect using Extreme Speed is only legal with a Hasty nature and Shiny forme. While this hinders Genesect's ability to check Extreme Killer Arceus, it makes Genesect faster than maximum Speed base 90 Pokemon and neutral-natured base 99 Speed Pokemon like Xerneas and Yveltal with maximum Speed investment.</li> <li>Download gives Genesect a boost in Attack or Special Attack depending on the foe's defensive stats when Genesect switches in.</li> <li>Choice Band gives Genesect a needed reinforcement in damage output, and it allows Genesect to do formidable damage when combined with Download.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Genesect struggles to switch into most offensive foes despite its good defensive typing. At best, it can pivot into attacks from Choice Scarf Xerneas lacking Hidden Power Fire and resisted Judgment from Arceus formes once or twice; however, even a small amount of prior damage will make it fall to +2 Moonblast from Geomancy Xerneas. This means Genesect has to choose between relying on almost always switching in unharmed to take on Xerneas lacking coverage to hit Steel-types or focus more on functioning as a pivot while getting slowly worn down.</li> <li>Though Genesect will mostly use U-turn to generate momentum and prevent many Pokemon it invites in from easily taking advantage of it, it will have to resort locking itself into different moves depending on the situation. Iron Head can be used to threaten Fairy-types and pressure slower teams, as it does decent damage with Choice Band and an Attack boost from Download. Weakened setup sweepers should be taken out with Extreme Speed, and it can also be used to score a possible KO on defensive Ho-Oh after Stealth Rock. If Genesect is in a horrendous matchup, has to lure and remove Ho-Oh or a support Arceus forme, or has to revenge kill slower, healthy foes, such as Swords Dance-boosted Primal Groudon and Extreme Killer Arceus, using Explosion will be a worthwhile decision, though it is possible that a Ghost- or Steel-type Pokemon may pivot into Genesect with an intent to take a weak hit from its other moves.</li> <li>Think twice before attempting to send Genesect in against offensive teams to revenge kill a foe with Extreme Speed. Though Extreme Speed may be powerful enough to take out frail sweepers, it may lack sufficient power to land a KO without Download boosting Genesect's Attack. Genesect locked into Extreme Speed is also very exploitable, as it invites threats like Necrozma-DM and Marshadow to take advantage of it, while bulkier setup sweepers like Primal Groudon and Zygarde can set up on it as well. Mega Gengar is another concerning foe when Genesect is about to lock itself into Extreme Speed, as Mega Gengar's Shadow Tag and immunity to Extreme Speed means Genesect will be hopelessly trapped.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>A good number of Pokemon massively benefit from Genesect's ability to create ideal matchups. Primal Kyogre can gain an opportunity to safely switch in through Genesect's U-turn and threaten Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, or a physically defensive foe. Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Arceus-Ground can be pivoted into Steel-types switching into Genesect.</li> <li>Primal Groudon also provides Genesect's team with more security against Xerneas by being a reliable check, provides Stealth Rock support to keep Ho-Oh at bay, manages problematic Steel-types, and defeats physically defensive foes with Overheat or Swords Dance-boosted attacks without forcing Genesect to use Explosion to bypass them. In return, Genesect can switch into Toxic for Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Various support Arceus formes can justify running Stealth Rock to prevent Ho-Oh from liberally switching into Genesect, provide a good defensive presence to check dangerous foes in the event where Genesect locks itself into a poor move, and benefit from Genesect drawing in and removing Ho-Oh with Explosion if they can't pressure Ho-Oh carrying Defog. Should they be in a bad matchup against an opposing support Arceus forme, Genesect can switch into Toxic and threaten to 2HKO the foe using Iron Head with the appropriate Download boost or net a surprise KO with Explosion.</li> <li>Mega Salamence and defensive Zygarde check to Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh. Mega Salamence can benefit from the pressure that Genesect applies on Fairy-types and certain Steel-types, and defensive Zygarde can spread paralysis with Glare to make up for Genesect's average Speed.</li> <li>Defog users like Giratina-O and Ho-Oh can prevent Genesect from getting worn down by entry hazards and threaten certain Primal Groudon variants, and Genesect can create a favorable matchup for them to freely spread status or attack by pivoting into them with U-turn.</li> </ul> "

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Access to Spikes and Taunt and a Speed tier that allows it to outspeed Arceus formes provide Greninja with a nice niche as a dedicated lead in the Ubers tier.</li> <li>Greninja's Water / Dark typing allows it to also be a great anti-lead against other common dedicated leads such as Cloyster and Deoxys-S, as it naturally resists Cloyster's attacks, outspeeds it, and can use Taunt against it, and it is able to 2HKO and force predictions against Deoxys-S. Furthermore, unlike Cloyster, Necrozma-DM is unable to lead against it.</li> <li>Greninja does, however, struggle to really dish out any damage prior to activating Battle Bond, which can make it difficult to effectively provide offensive pressure, as it needs to claim a KO in order to do so. This low damage output results in it being completely shut down by the tier's two Magic Bounce users in Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye, which are able to bounce back entry hazards and use Taunt against it while failing to be 2HKOed by any of its attacks.</li> <li>Its subpar bulk also means that it can often struggle to get many entry hazards up against setup sweepers, as it is forced to use Taunt on them to prevent them from setting up but is also very often brought down to its Focus Sash even without boosts. If these setup sweepers have access to a priority move, Greninja can completely fail to get up any entry hazards.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Greninja has a very specific niche in the Ubers tier, so despite its impressive movepool, it isn't really able to utilize the majority of these.</li> <li>Water Shuriken or Shadow Sneak could be potentially useful to improve the matchup against Deoxys-S by preventing it from getting up multiple entry hazards; however, Greninja would much prefer to run either Ice Beam or Substitute in this slot due to the coverage or utility options these moves offer.</li> <li>Hydro Pump can be used as a fourth move in order to pressure Mega Diancie; however, this would be sacrificing the coverage options that Ice Beam could offer or the security of Substitute.</li> <li>A suicide lead set with Protean containing Spikes + Toxic Spikes + Taunt + Shadow Sneak with the ability Protean can be run, utilizing Greninja's ability to set dual entry hazards and spinblock with Shadow Sneak; however, this takes away Greninja's niche with Battle Bond and tends to be outclassed by other entry hazard setters such as Deoxys-S.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Magic Bounce</strong>: Both of the viable Magic Bounce users in Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye aren't too fazed by any of Greninja's attacks and can bounce back Spikes and Taunt thanks to their ability. Mega Diancie is able to bring Greninja down to its Focus Sash with Moonblast, while Mega Sableye is able to avoid the 2HKO and stall it out with Toxic + Recover. It does, however, have to be cautious of Dark Pulse flinches.</p> <p><strong>Smeargle: Smeargle can be a real hassle for Greninja, as it is able to bounce back its entry hazards, Taunt it with Magic Coat, and paralyze it with Nuzzle; it also causes a nuisance to the type of teams Greninja thrives on by slowing down the whole grounded team with Sticky Web.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers</strong>: Setup sweepers are able to potentially completely prevent or limit the amount of entry hazards that Greninja is able to set, as it is forced to Taunt them to prevent them from sweeping, rather than focusing on setting entry hazards. Setup sweepers with priority attacks such as Arceus and Mega Lucario are able to potentially completely deter Greninja from setting entry hazards, as Arceus is able to 2HKO Greninja with Extreme Speed and Mega Lucario is able to bring Greninja down to its Focus Sash and then pick it off with Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats: Ultra Necrozma, Choice Scarf Yveltal, and Choice Scarf Xerneas all have enough natural bulk to be able to survive a single hit from Greninja and can 2HKO it or bring it down to its Focus Sash with any of their attacks, limiting Greninja to only being able to set up one entry hazard at most.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Spikes is a really effective means of punishing grounded Pokemon, as it deals up to 25% of the maximum HP in damage to any Pokemon that switches in. This allows your team to more effectively pressure Steel-type threats such as Necrozma-DM and Magearna, which otherwise take minimal damage from Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Taunt stops setup, entry hazards being put up, status spreading, and entry hazard removal, thus being crucial in order for Greninja to effectively perform its role as a suicide lead. Dark Pulse prevents Greninja from being completely passive, preventing it from becoming setup fodder for offensive Necrozma-DM at Team Preview. It also allows Greninja to utilize its ability in Battle Bond, allowing it to become a more offensive threat, most notably outspeeding Mega Gengar and Ultra Necrozma and being able to OHKO them both, as well as 2HKOing Trick Room Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Substitute is primarily used to stop Smeargle from paralyzing Greninja with Nuzzle, as Taunt doesn't prevent Smeargle from using this move. Once Greninja is behind a Substitute, this puts it in a situation of mind games, rather than Greninja being at a disadvantage.</li> <li>Ice Beam allows Greninja to pressure Mega Salamence and Zygarde better, as it is able to OHKO Salamence even without Battle Bond, whereas after transformation, it's able to outspeed +1 offensive Zygarde-C and OHKO it. It also gives it a chance of 2HKOing Mega Diancie, which otherwise would be able to prevent Greninja from setting up entry hazards, and is immune to Taunt thanks to Magic Bounce, and is able to bring Greninja down to its Focus Sash with Moonblast.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>This is a classic offensive set with maximum Special Attack investment for the highest possible damage output and maximum Speed investment so Greninja moves first. A Timid nature is required in order for Greninja to outspeed Arceus formes, which is crucial to prevent it them from using Defog.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Greninja's main focus should be to set Spikes and prevent the opposing team from either setting up in front of it, removing these Spikes or setting their own entry hazards by clicking Taunt.</li> <li>Against setup sweepers, such as Rock Polish Primal Groudon and Extreme Killer Arceus, Greninja should prioritize clicking Taunt, as the offensive builds that Greninja fits best on tend to struggle to have the tools to deal with these threats.</li> <li>If it's not able to activate Battle Bond, Greninja should be used to chip away at the foe with either Dark Pulse or Ice Beam, providing its teammates with an easier time of setting up to sweep. Due to its relatively low bulk and damage output prior to activating Battle Bond, if entry hazards are on your side of the field or if its Focus Sash has been broken, Greninja is best used as a sacrifice fodder to provide you with an opportunity to bring in a teammate without taking any extra damage.</li> <li>If Greninja is able to activate Battle Bond, it can be preserved, as it can become a potential revenge killer for weakened foes, as it's only naturally outsped by Deoxys-A, Pheromosa, and Mega Mewtwo Y, and it's able to outspeed a +1 Zygarde.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>As Greninja's primary role is to provide offensive pressure by setting Spikes and it is only really used as a dedicated lead, its teammates need to also be offensive Pokemon to compensate for its general lack of offensive pressure and to ensure that Greninja's entry hazards stay on the battlefield after it has been KOed.</li> <li>Strong wallbreakers such as Xerneas, Necrozma-DM or Ultra Necrozma, and Mega Salamence are all incredible partners for Greninja, as the addition of Spikes on the battlefield makes it harder for opposing Pokemon to switch into them. Futhermore, all of these Pokemon are able to punish any attempts to remove entry hazards by setting up with their dedicated boosting move, ultimately making them harder to switch into.</li> <li>Checks to the tier's Magic Bounce users in Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie as well as Fairy-type answers are crucial teammates for Greninja, as Magic Bounce completely removes Greninja's ability to set entry hazards.</li> <li>Offensive Stealth Rock Primal Groudon sets are almost mandatory on teams with Greninja, as Stealth Rock is still able to punish all Ground-immune foes that take no damage from Spikes such as Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Lugia, providing additional damage to grounded foes. Furthermore, it is able to provide teams with a much-needed answer to Xerneas and is able to comfortably anti-lead against Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie.</li> <li>Fast Taunt users such as Mega Gengar and Yveltal are great partners for Greninja, as they're able to prevent foes from removing entry hazards after Greninja has been KOed, as well as acting as great anti-offense measures, as they prevent setup sweepers from setting up. Mega Gengar is especially noteworthy here, as its super fast Taunt is useful for preventing support Arceus formes from using Defog, as well as punishing Choice-locked Defoggers such as Xerneas, as they risk getting trapped and KOed thanks to Mega Gengar's Shadow Tag.</li> </ul> "

This means it is mostly restricted to teams that rely on keeping up offensive pressure and enjoy its hazard stacking capabilities.</li> <li>Klefki is forced out by numerous offensive Pokemon that can exploit its weaknesses to Fire- and Ground-types, such as Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Ho-Oh, and strong neutral hits from the likes of Primal Kyogre and Marshadow will break past it as well.</li> <li>Most importantly of all, Klefki faces competition from other Spikes setters such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, Deoxys-S, and Cloyster. Ferrothorn handles more support Arceus formes and Primal Kyogre and has better longevity as it keeps itself healthy with Leech Seed, while Skarmory is a durable Spikes setter and physically defensive wall on bulkier teams. Deoxys-S and Cloyster are both reliable suicide leads; Deoxys-S can prevent opposing hazards or Defog using Taunt, while Cloyster can pick between Spikes or Toxic Spikes and remove opposing hazards with Rapid Spin.</li> <li>Klefki also shares its Steel / Fairy typing with an Ubers staple in Magearna, which has better bulk, is less passive, has access to Heal Bell, and can pivot using Volt Switch. Magearna's overall consistency as a better Xerneas and Yveltal check makes Klefki less desirable on some teams.</li> <li>Klefki fits best on offensive teams, where it can successfully support sweepers and wallbreakers such as Primal Groudon and Dragon Dance Zygarde-C.</li> </ul> ",

Certain Speed-boosting threats such as Ultra Necrozma and Geomancy Xerneas should be hit with Thunder Wave, slowing them down for revenge killers.</li> <li>If your opponent has Defoggers that are vulnerable to status, such as Arceus-Ground and Ho-Oh, attempt to cripple them so they can be dealt with by teammates.</li> <li>When faced against deadly setup sweepers such as Rock Polish Primal Groudon, Double Dance Necrozma-DM, and Geomancy Xerneas, it can be important to sacrifice Klefki to status them in order to stop them from blowing holes into your team.</li> <li>In certain matchups, use Klefki sparingly, as keeping it alive to use Thunder Wave on a big threat to your team can be important to gaining the edge in a match.</li> <li>Conversely, if no other good switch-ins exist, pivot Klefki into strong wallbreakers such as offensive Yveltal and Deoxys-A to prevent them from heavily damaging teammates. When up against Life Orb or Choice Specs Yveltal, decide whether to prioritize Spikes or try to weaken it with Play Rough, as teammates might struggle to handle a healthy Yveltal, although this could lead to a loss of momentum if they switch Yveltal out.</li> <li>Take note that Prankster-boosted status moves don't affect Dark-types and grounded Pokemon in Psychic Terrain.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Stealth Rock + Swords Dance Primal Groudon and Klefki form a formidable entry hazard stacking core, as this Primal Groudon set can put up Stealth Rock against Ho-Oh and pick off paralyzed threats such as Ultra Necrozma and Xerneas, while Klefki helps Groudon's matchup versus certain Defoggers such as Giratina-O and Lugia.</li> <li>Sweepers such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Necrozma-DM take advantage of Spikes and status crippling their checks such as Zygarde-C and support Arceus formes. Choice Scarf Yveltal and Xerneas provide additional insurance against faster foes, can check Marshadow, and are able to clean the opposing team more comfortably with Klefki's support. Xerneas also helps Klefki by being an additional check to opposing Yveltal, especially bulkier variants.</li> <li>Marshadow greatly benefits from Klefki's Spikes stacking, as support Arceus formes hit neutrally by Life Orb Close Combat are guaranteed to be 2HKOed after a single layer of Spikes. Z-Move variants also work well with Klefki, as +1 Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike OHKOes maximum HP support Arceus formes, including Arceus-Fairy, when met with the same conditions.</li> <li>Mega Salamence is an exceptional partner, as it can handle Ho-Oh and circumvent burns with Facade or Refresh sets. Klefki's Spikes also helps Mega Salamence by chipping support Arceus formes, Zygarde-C, and Necrozma-DM into range of its attacks.</li> <li>Mega Gengar and Giratina-O form a Hex spam core with Klefki, spreading status and allowing the Ghost-types to break down defensive cores. Additionally, Giratina-O can switch into Fire- and Ground-type attacks for Klefki.</li> <li>Dragon Dance Zygarde-C enjoys support Arceus formes, Necrozma-DM, and Giratina-O being paralyzed or badly poisoned, as it can find setup opportunities on a full paralysis or let Toxic damage rack up by using Substitute and Protect. Dragon Tail on Zygarde-C also helps rack up Spikes damage on all support Arceus formes barring Arceus-Fairy.</li> <li>Offensive variants of Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Fairy pair well with Klefki defensively while keeping up offensive pressure, and both are able to handle Zygarde-C. Arceus-Ground also handles certain Primal Groudon sets, while Arceus-Fairy more easily handles Yveltal.</li> </ul> "

Offensively, Fairy is also highly effective, having key trumps over Dark- and Dragon-types and no types immune to it.</li> <li>Xerneas's stats aren't impressive in a single aspect, but base 131 Special Attack with Fairy Aura makes it strong; Xerneas's bulk is solid, which eases setup and makes it more difficult to revenge kill; and base 99 Speed makes it as fast as it needs to be.</li> <li>Xerneas has access to powerful support moves such as Defog and Aromatherapy and is able to circumvent a few of its typical offensive and defensive checks via a variety of coverage and support options to play around with.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM and Magearna are reliable and effective Xerneas checks.</li> <li>The most common Pokemon in the tier, Primal Groudon, resists Moonblast, and Xerneas is somewhat threatened by Mega Gengar.</li> <li>A noticeable flaw is that it lacks instant recovery and is afflicted by all entry hazards and non-volatile status, which somewhat limits its defensive synergy.</li> </ul> ",

At best, Geomancy Xerneas can 2HKO support Necrozma-DM and avoid the OHKO from Sunsteel Strike; however, +1 Z-Geomancy Xerneas is still 3HKOed. Choice Scarf, Choice Specs, and the defensive set cannot do much to any Necrozma-DM variant.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Primal Groudon resists Moonblast, is always EVed to check boosted Xerneas, and can phaze Xerneas with Roar, afflict it with status, or smack it with Precipice Blades.</p> <p><strong>Magearna</strong>: Magearna tanks even any boosted attack from Xerneas well, and it removes said boosts with Heart Swap.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Steel-types</strong>: Klefki, Mega Scizor, Bronzong, and Aegislash can survive boosted attacks from Xerneas. They can inflict Xerneas with status or hit it hard with STAB Steel-type moves. Celesteela is defeated by Thunder and Ferrothorn is defeated by Focus Blast, but otherwise they can do the same.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh: Ho-Oh tanks Moonblast rather well and can hit Xerneas with strong physical attacks, inflict it with status, or phaze it with Whirlwind. However, Ho-Oh is incredibly vulnerable to Stealth Rock and is typically OHKOed by Hidden Power Rock.</p> <p><strong>Lugia</strong>: Lugia checks Xerneas via Multiscale and Whirlwind, but it is KOed by a boosted Thunder after Stealth Rock.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Chansey</strong>: Both Blissey and Chansey can stall out most Xerneas sets with Toxic due to their powerful special bulk, but they cannot defeat Z-Geomancy Xerneas on their own.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Priority attacks are typically employed by offense teams and used to revenge kill a boosted Xerneas. Users include Extreme Killer Arceus, Mega Lucario, Marshadow, Deoxys-A, and Rayquaza.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar: Although not a check to boosted Geomancy sets, Mega Gengar can trap and eliminate the defensive set or revenge kill unboosted Geomancy and Choice Specs sets.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Poison and -Steel</strong>: These Arceus formes have a Fairy-type resistance and are bulky enough to check most boosted Xerneas sets, but Arceus-Steel is KOed by +2 Focus Blast.</p> ",

  "Yveltal": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Yveltal is a commonly seen and versatile powerhouse in the tier that is capable of filling multiple different roles as a result of great attributes such as its stat distribution, typing, and damage-boosting ability, with an expansive movepool to complement all of these traits.</li> <li>Offensively, Yveltal is a very strong wallbreaker that can easily fit into offensive teams thanks to its difficult-to-handle STAB attacks, which are able to 2HKO a large amount of the tier on their own, leaving a lot of room for customization based on the team structure it is selected for.</li> <li>Yveltal is also one of the best offensive checks to many of the metagame's most threatening Pokemon, such as Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Marshadow. It is difficult for Yveltal to be of little use in battle even with offensive sets, as it adds much-needed role compression to offensive teams. Defensive sets further improve on Yveltal's ability to handle top threats and provide utility to bulkier teams.</li> <li>Yveltal's versatility allows it to be a wallbreaker, a Choice Scarf revenge killer, a dedicated stallbreaker, or even a physical wall.</li> <li>While base 99 Speed is sufficient for wallbreaking purposes, Yveltal tends to be reliant on its reasonable bulk, hit-and-run strategies, Sucker Punch, or a Choice Scarf set to avoid being revenge killed or dealt with by faster Pokemon, as many teams have a faster attacker than Yveltal that can get the better of it.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Using Flyinium Z is possible with Sky Attack on a physical set or with Hurricane on a special set but lacks a real use that other sets can't already offer.</li> <li>Darkinium Z is also usable with one of Yveltal's many Dark-type STAB options but doesn't have a real purpose other than one strong attack against a target. Z-Moves are far better utilized by other Pokemon that can pair with Yveltal, such as Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Substitute can take advantage of Yveltal's ability to force switches, and with Disable, it can punish Pokemon that only have one ideal move to break Yveltal's Substitutes. This requires using up two of Yveltal's moveslots to accomplish, however, and there are better options to consider.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Arceus-Fairy stands out as the best answer to Yveltal, outspeeding it and taking all of its attacks while only fearing Toxic or a lucky Choice Specs Yveltal that has Hurricane. U-turn can also throw a wrench into the matchup, as Yveltal has many potential partners that can easily take advantage of Arceus-Fairy such as Necrozma-DM and Mega Gengar. Xerneas is a common offensive check to Yveltal that can pivot into Dark Pulse and force Yveltal out while having Aromatherapy to deal with the potential Toxic poison Yveltal has spread, but it has to be careful about taking too much damage from an offensive set's Oblivion Wing. Magearna resists many of Yveltal's moves outside of Heat Wave and has the bulk to repeatedly switch in and Heal Bell to remove any status Yveltal has spread, but it can be taken advantage of with U-turn or worn down by repeated attacks. Mega Diancie resists both of Yveltal's STAB attacks, has Magic Bounce to mess with the utility options that various sets utilize, and generally outspeeds most sets, but it lacks the defensive stats to repeatedly stand up to offensive Yveltal's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Tyranitar and the rare Arceus-Rock make for good Yveltal checks. Tyranitar resists most of Yveltal's common attacks and takes little damage thanks to the Special Defense boost from sand, but it has to be wary of a rare Focus Blast or Yveltal using U-turn to pivot out of it. Arceus-Rock is naturally faster than Yveltal and can strike it down with Judgment while healing off Dark Pulse damage with Recover, but has the same fears as Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Dark: Arceus-Dark's ability to outspeed Yveltal and avoid the 2HKO from all of Yveltal's standard attacks makes it a reasonable check, as it can retaliate with Ice Beam or cripple Yveltal with Toxic. Yveltal is capable of winning in various conditions, however. The Life Orb set can use a combination of Oblivion Wing, Taunt, and Toxic to break through Arceus-Dark's healing and win a fight. Choice item sets are able to use U-turn to pivot off of Arceus-Dark into a suitable teammate and eventually wear it down. Stallbreaker and physically defensive sets only fear Arceus-Dark's higher Speed, which can lead to it using Toxic on Yveltal before it can do the same to try and stall Arceus-Dark out.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh is sufficiently bulky enough to take Yveltal's special attacks and try to badly poison Yveltal before pivoting out and recovering with Regenerator. Ho-Oh can also stall with Recover until Yveltal weakens itself with Life Orb recoil, but this comes with the risk of a Dark Pulse flinch. Knock Off variants of Life Orb Yveltal can also deal a lot of damage to Ho-Oh, potentially 2HKOing it if it switches into Dark Pulse. Foul Play will also deal considerable damage to offensive Ho-Oh sets. Stealth Rock being up can massively limit Ho-Oh's ability to check Yveltal as well.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers</strong>: Pokemon with a higher base Speed than Yveltal such as Mega Salamence, Mega Lucario, Ultra Necrozma, Mewtwo, and Deoxys-A are capable of dealing enough damage to take Yveltal out. These Pokemon have to be very careful, however, as Yveltal is capable of taking a single hit from the majority of them and retaliating with a strong attack. There is also the potential of Sucker Punch from the Life Orb and physically defensive sets, and these faster attackers are also ideal targets of the Choice Scarf set, which reverses the matchup.</p> <p><strong>Support Arceus Formes: Maximum HP Arceus formes neutral to Dark Pulse such as Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Water are able to switch into Life Orb Yveltal and stall with Recover until Life Orb recoil wears Yveltal down into the KO range of an attack such as Ice Beam. Taunt variants of Life Orb Yveltal are able to trade blows with these support Arceus formes and potentially win a duel, but they will come out severely damaged. Choice Specs Yveltal can easily overpower these support Arceus formes. Choice Scarf Yveltal has the ability to pivot out with U-turn to a better-suited teammate, but its attacks struggle to break through a support Arceus forme. Stallbreaker and physically defensive Yveltal variants will only be annoyed if they are badly poisoned by Toxic first but will still stall out these Arceus formes either way.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Chansey: Blissey and Chansey have the bulk to handle Yveltal's special attacks with ease, but they are only effective checks to Choice item variants, and Yveltal can still use U-turn on these sets to avoid these Pokemon. Taunt variants of Yveltal will easily shut down any attempts that Blissey and Chansey make to check it, and Taunt is commonly seen on any variant that isn't holding Choice Scarf or Choice Specs.</p> <p><strong>Electric- and Ice-types</strong>: Dedicated Electric- and Ice-type attackers are very rare in Ubers but make good offensive checks to Yveltal regardless. The likes of Tapu Koko, Zekrom, and Kyurem-W are more than capable of OHKOing Yveltal if given the chance, but they can struggle to switch in safely.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye: While Mega Sableye cannot stand up to offensive Yveltal's attacks, it will take Foul Play with ease, and Magic Bounce can discourage using utility moves such as Taunt and Toxic, making it more difficult to break through defensive teams. A well timed bounce can force stallbreaker and physically defensive Yveltal variants to switch, as they struggle to effectively break through other Yveltal checks such as support Arceus formes and Blissey without access to Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic poison and paralysis can be very crippling to Yveltal, with higher effectiveness depending on the set. Defensive and stallbreaker sets hate getting badly poisoned, while paralysis affects Yveltal's offensive abilities. Burns are also annoying to Foul Play Yveltal variants, as it will halve the damage of Foul Play and make it much more difficult to use it against enemy Pokemon effectively.</p> ",

        "name": "Life Orb",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Dark Pulse is Yveltal's primary attack. With Life Orb, Dark Aura, and a Special Attack-boosting nature, it is strong enough to 2HKO foes as bulky as support Arceus formes neutral to the move, making it a fearsome wallbreaker and forcing teams to pack a Dark-resistant Pokemon or a special wall that can handle the attack.</li> <li>Oblivion Wing has great neutral coverage alongside Dark Pulse, hitting Fairy-type switch-ins such as Xerneas for a 2HKO. Oblivion Wing also heals 75% of the damage dealt, which comes in handy to counteract the residual damage from weak attacks, status, Life Orb recoil, and Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Taunt prevents the usage of status moves against Yveltal's team, making it easier to break through bulky targets that cannot effectively deal with Yveltal's damage output. It is also helpful against offensive teams, preventing offensive Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Xerneas from using Yveltal as a setup target so that teammates can better handle them, or making a Taunted target a setup opportunity for a teammate. Taunt and Oblivion Wing can be enough to win a duel against some support Arceus formes.</li> <li>Sucker Punch further increases Yveltal's offensive abilities by letting it get the first hit in against would-be revenge killers such as Mega Gengar and adds a useful priority attack to support its team against faster threats, such as Ultra Necrozma and boosted Double Dance Necrozma-DM. Taunt and Sucker Punch can be a potent combination and can force mind games against targets if Yveltal is weakened.</li> <li>Toxic is a viable alternative to Sucker Punch that takes advantage of the many switches Yveltal can force in order to poison difficult-to-break checks such as Arceus-Dark, Tyranitar, and Arceus-Fairy, weakening their effectiveness as consistent Yveltal switch-ins over the course of the match.</li> <li>Knock Off is another viable option that gives this Yveltal variant an easier time against Ho-Oh, breaks through Chansey and Blissey more quickly, and removes most common items used on switch-ins such as Magearna and Xerneas.</li> <li>Heat Wave is a viable option to eliminate Magearna as a check, which can also help teammates such as Xerneas. Repeated use of Dark Pulse can weaken Magearna enough for it to be KOed by a surprise Heat Wave. Heat Wave also has the ability to immediately OHKO Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, avoiding a retaliation, as Dark Pulse 2HKOes them.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum Special Attack investment with a Special Attack-boosting nature gives Yveltal maximum wallbreaking potential and reaches key damage benchmarks against various Arceus formes and Xerneas.</li> <li>Maximum Speed investment gets the most out of Yveltal's Speed tier, letting it outspeed threats such as Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>The choice of nature is an important decision to make with Life Orb Yveltal. Special Attack-boosting natures are optimal for damage output, as this set is intended to be a wallbreaker and the usage of Sucker Punch means that Speed-boosting natures are not as important. Speed-boosting natures can be useful on sets lacking Sucker Punch, as Yveltal can then outspeed Timid Lunala and Jolly Rayquaza to hit them first.</li> <li>By reducing Yveltal's Defense stat with the usage of a Mild or Hasty nature, Yveltal is more susceptible to getting OHKOed by Rayquaza, Marshadow, and physical Primal Kyogre after Stealth Rock damage. Ultra Necrozma and Primal Groudon also gain better odds to OHKO Yveltal from full HP with Stone Edge.</li> <li>By reducing Yveltal's Special Defense stat with the usage of a Rash or Naive nature, the matchup against support Arceus formes becomes more difficult, and Yveltal's ability to offensively check Mewtwo, Giratina-O, and special variants of Primal Groudon comes with an increased risk of getting KOed.</li> <li>Life Orb is the best item to increase Yveltal's overall damage output while retaining the flexibility of switching moves, which is an important aspect behind Yveltal's threat level.</li> <li>Metronome can be considered as an alternative item to Life Orb, trading immediate damage for better dueling power against support Arceus formes and other bulky foes.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Life Orb Yveltal aims to break down the enemy team while providing an offensive check to threats such as Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Marshadow.</li> <li>Yveltal can find room to switch in against Ground- and Ghost-type moves or on predicted moves that don't pressure it, such as entry hazards and recovery moves.</li> <li>Keeping Yveltal sets with Sucker Punch around can be very helpful to stop setup sweepers from taking over the match. Ultra Necrozma and Mewtwo have a hard time sweeping any team with a Sucker Punch Yveltal ready to revenge kill them. Having Sucker Punch available to take down a weakened Double Dance Necrozma-DM can also save a game.</li> <li>Yveltal's matchup against most of the metagame is favorable, making it a good candidate to lead with to force the opponent to act defensively. However, this isn't a foolproof plan, as the opponent can lead with a check to Yveltal.</li> <li>Support Arceus formes can be difficult for Yveltal to overcome, depending on the forme. Arceus-Fairy is the hardest for Yveltal to take down and is best hit on the switch with an attack or Toxic before switching to a suitable teammate. Arceus-Dark, Arceus-Water, and Arceus-Ground can be beaten under the right conditions, such as afflicting them with Taunt on the switch and recovering any damage with repeated use of Oblivion Wing.</li> <li>Dark Pulse is generally a safe option to use to wear down checks. Oblivion Wing is best used when Yveltal is low on health or when you predict the opponent to switch to a Dark-resistant Pokemon. Taunt is best used on defensive Pokemon to prevent entry hazards, recovery options, and status moves, but it can be used to stop a setup sweeper that Yveltal's team would be unable to handle if Yveltal switched out. Taunt + Oblivion Wing is a potent combination to sustain Yveltal and win in matchups against defensive threats. Yveltal can also use Taunt in a sacrificial way to give a teammate a free chance to set up.</li> <li>If there are no obvious Yveltal checks in Team Preview, it is likely that the opponent's unrevealed Arceus forme is capable of checking Yveltal in some way, so keep an eye out.</li> <li>In Yveltal mirror matchups, note that the slower Yveltal will usually come out on top due to receiving Oblivion Wing recovery after draining the enemy Yveltal's HP.</li> <li>While Yveltal can take advantage of Primal Groudon's use of Stealth Rock or Precipice Blades, it can still be a very risky matchup. Primal Groudon's coverage moves such as Rock Tomb, Stone Edge, and Overheat can put an aggressive Yveltal in a very bad situation, most likely leading to its KO.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Life Orb Yveltal best fits teams of an offensive nature, as it is an offensive Ground-immune Pokemon with difficult-to-handle attacks and a possible priority move.</li> <li>Primal Groudon stands out as an excellent partner, with many variants of it able to assist Yveltal and vice versa. Generally, Primal Groudon puts pressure onto the Fairy- and Rock-type Pokemon that can scare Yveltal, while Yveltal heavily threatens Primal Groudon's defensive checks such as Lugia and Giratina. Stealth Rock variants of Primal Groudon appreciate Yveltal's ability to pressure Defog users, while more offensive sets can break through the many support Arceus formes that trouble Yveltal.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM is another excellent partner that can create a potent core with Primal Groudon involved. Necrozma-DM adds additional offensive pressure and security against Fairy-types, while Yveltal can handle Dark-, Ground-, and Ghost-type attacks directed at Necrozma-DM. Necrozma-DM can also act as a Stealth Rock setter with the longevity to repeatedly take on Fairy-type threats for Yveltal.</li> <li>Xerneas adds additional wallbreaking pressure to Yveltal's team. Geomancy variants appreciate Yveltal's ability to chip away at Magearna while also threatening Necrozma-DM and Primal Groudon. Choice Scarf Xerneas offers revenge killing utility against Pokemon such as Marshadow and Ultra Necrozma along with cleric support, meaning Yveltal isn't as hard pressed to offensively check them with Sucker Punch.</li> <li>Mega Gengar can trap and remove Yveltal's biggest check in Arceus-Fairy while also threatening to trap many other support Arceus formes. It can also revenge kill Ultra Necrozma, which is helpful on teams where Yveltal opts for Toxic over Sucker Punch.</li> <li>Extreme Killer Arceus benefits offensive teams greatly by adding additional priority and therefore revenge killing potential, while Yveltal helps against the Ghost-types that can trouble it.</li> <li>Arceus-Water is a great support Arceus forme for bulkier teams that adds a check to many Primal Groudon variants, particularly special variants. It also assists against Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, Mega Salamence, and Mega Lucario and can pivot into Primal Kyogre, all of which can help take pressure off Yveltal.</li> <li>Arceus-Ground can opt for either a Swords Dance or a Calm Mind set to act as an extra soft check to Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM for Yveltal. In return, Yveltal can heavily pressure Ground-immune Pokemon such as Celesteela, Skarmory, and Giratina-O to make room for Arceus-Ground to sweep.</li> <li>Sticky Web teams with Smeargle as the entry hazard setter can benefit from Yveltal's ability to outspeed and break through defensive cores with Sticky Web active. Arceus formes in particular become easy targets for Yveltal under Sticky Web, as the likes of Arceus-Water are vulnerable to a faster Taunt and easily 2HKOed. Yveltal's access to Taunt and Sucker Punch further reinforces its potential on Sticky Web teams, as Yveltal can Taunt many Defog users to keep Sticky Web up and prevent setup sweepers from turning the tables against Yveltal's team, with Sucker Punch as added security.</li> </ul> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Foul Play is a key move for Choice Scarf Yveltal, as one of the main purposes behind this set is to outspeed and take advantage of Swords Dance-boosted Arceus formes, Necrozma-DM, Mega Lucario, Ultra Necrozma, and Primal Groudon. It also hits Ho-Oh, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Primal Kyogre harder than Dark Pulse does on this set.</li> <li>Dark Pulse is a more consistent damage option, helpful for cleaning up weakened teams. It may lack in power against sufficiently bulky neutral targets such as most Arceus formes, however.</li> <li>Oblivion Wing on a Choice Scarf set helps to revenge kill Fighting-types such as Marshadow and clean up weakened Dark-resistant Pokemon. It also lets Yveltal recover the residual damage taken from the likes of Stealth Rock over the course of the match.</li> <li>U-turn allows Yveltal to act as a pivot by forcing out a Pokemon with the threat of its STAB attacks and using U-turn instead to let a teammate take full advantage of the free switch. Due to Choice Scarf Yveltal's lower damage output in comparison to wallbreaker sets and its locked move choices, U-turn can be a safer option than attacking with typical moves.</li> <li>Defog is a viable alternative to U-turn that adds anti-hazard measures for Yveltal's team. This can come in very handy against offensive teams that utilize a dedicated lead, as once the lead is gone, Yveltal is able to outspeed many opposing Pokemon and remove entry hazards such as Sticky Web.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>32 Defense EVs allow Yveltal to survive Ultra Necrozma's Stone Edge from full health.</li> <li>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment gives Yveltal the optimal stats to be a revenge killer for its team. A Modest nature is preferred to increase the power behind Yveltal's special attacks and help with cleaning up teams.</li> <li>Using a Choice Scarf with a Modest nature allows Yveltal to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame excluding Deoxys-S. The extra Speed from a Timid nature doesn't let it outspeed any additional threats of relevance outside of +1 Adamant Mega Blaziken.</li> <li>A bulkier spread of 124 Def / 200 SpA / 184 Spe with a Modest nature allows Yveltal to take a +2 Extreme Speed from Extreme Killer Arceus variants that don't use a damage-boosting item while outspeeding everything up to Timid Mega Mewtwo Y.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Choice Scarf Yveltal is primarily a revenge killer. This means that it is best brought in under very safe conditions to remove a problematic threat to its team. Fast attackers weak to Yveltal's STAB moves are easy targets. Most of these Pokemon are also weak to U-turn, meaning that even if they switch out, Yveltal can retain momentum for its team.</li> <li>This set can also clean groups of weakened Pokemon, but Yveltal's checks should be taken care of by its teammates first.</li> <li>Note that Yveltal's damage output can be lacking against bulky targets such as Primal Kyogre, Ho-Oh, and support Arceus formes. Choice Scarf variants rely on Foul Play or super effective moves to pose a threat to a team. U-turn can prevent Yveltal from being a momentum sink should this become a problem, but opponents can take advantage of this by not switching out if they can afford to take the risk.</li> <li>Choice Scarf Yveltal is still slower than a couple of boosting threats, even with a Timid nature. Rock Polish Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM, as well as Dragon Dance Mega Salamence, will still be faster than Yveltal after a boost, so it is usually futile to attempt to revenge kill them when they are set up.</li> <li>Keep Yveltal around and healthy so that it can act against Swords Dance-boosted threats. Taking risks when potential threats such as Swords Dance Arceus formes are unrevealed can be very detrimental.</li> <li>Defog should mainly be used in situations where Yveltal has forced a Pokemon out and entry hazards must be removed at all costs. Being locked into Defog against a Pokemon unafraid of Yveltal will likely result in giving a large advantage to the enemy team.</li> <li>Remember that locking Yveltal into a move can be taken advantage of, even if the attack was the best option against Yveltal's current target. Another threat can come in right after and take advantage of a Choice-locked Yveltal.</li> <li>Choice Scarf Yveltal has a very good matchup against Psychic Terrain teams, as it will outspeed and likely be able to take out the primary wallbreakers and sweepers of such teams.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Choice Scarf Yveltal is very strong against offensive teams, but it struggles with bulkier teams due to a lack of damage output and generally finding a lower number of Pokemon to revenge kill. Teams with a clear weakness to fast threats like Ultra Necrozma and Marshadow will likely consider this variant of Yveltal.</li> <li>Primal Kyogre is a great partner for this Yveltal set, as it can soft check Necrozma-DM and mixed Rock Polish Primal Groudon, two threats that can outspeed even Choice Scarf Yveltal after a Rock Polish. In return, Yveltal performs well against the fast attackers that try to KO Primal Kyogre by taking advantage of its low Speed.</li> <li>Stealth Rock + Swords Dance variants of Primal Groudon can be effective as well, setting Stealth Rock against bulky teams while using Swords Dance-boosted Precipice Blades to heavily threaten support Arceus formes that trouble this set. In return, Yveltal threatens Giratina, Lugia, and the fast attackers that can revenge kill Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Arceus-Water can play a more defensive role than Primal Kyogre, having the bulk and recovery to better check Rock Polish Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM while being a great option against Dragon Dance Mega Salamence, another threat that this Yveltal variant is likely to be slower than. Choice Scarf Yveltal can revenge kill the fast Psychic-type Pokemon such as Mewtwo, Deoxys-A, and Ultra Necrozma that threaten to take out Arceus-Water.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM offers much-needed help against Fairy-type Pokemon and can use Yveltal's U-turn to immediately pressure many of the opponent's Yveltal checks.</li> <li>Mega Gengar can trap and remove targets with the assistance of Yveltal's U-turn while threatening many bulky targets that take Yveltal's weaker attacks well.</li> </ul> "

        "name": "Stallbreaker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Foul Play takes advantage of the foe's Attack stat, dealing more damage to offensive Pokemon than Dark Pulse would without a boost, and it also lets Yveltal act as a defensive check to boosting attackers such as Extreme Killer Arceus and Primal Groudon. Using Foul Play means that Yveltal will have a harder time taking down defensive Pokemon such as Ferrothorn that don't mind the damage from it or Toxic, however.</li> <li>Dark Pulse on this set is rather weak in comparison to offensive sets, but it helps to wear down and break through targets more quickly. The flinch chance can prevent Pokemon from standing up to Yveltal, as well. It also helps to have an immediate damage option against offensive Pokemon, as waiting for Toxic damage to rack up can be very risky and isn't an available strategy against Poison- or Steel-type Pokemon.</li> <li>Toxic is this set's main way to deal damage and break through defensive targets. By outlasting foes with Roost and preventing their own recovery options with Taunt, this Yveltal set can be very difficult for defensive Pokemon such as Blissey, Ferrothorn, support Arceus formes, and defensive Zygarde-C to handle.</li> <li>Taunt prevents foes from recovering, using setup moves in an attempt to power through Yveltal, and setting entry hazards.</li> <li>Roost keeps Yveltal healthy and is a superior recovery option to Oblivion Wing, as this set aims to stay in battle against defensive Pokemon. Oblivion Wing needs high damage output to offer sufficient healing, which this variant of Yveltal lacks.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Near-maximum HP investment makes good use of Yveltal's high base HP stat, making it difficult to break for many defensive Pokemon and some offensive Pokemon. With the additional 76 Special Defense EVs, Yveltal is capable of avoiding the 4HKO from a support Arceus's Ice Beam if factoring in Leftovers recovery.</li> <li>184 Speed EVs and a Timid nature ensure that Yveltal will outspeed positive-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon and many other defensive Pokemon in the tier, allowing for a fast Taunt or Toxic before they can act against Yveltal.</li> <li>Maximum Speed investment is an option to outspeed Lunala and Rayquaza.</li> <li>Leftovers provides passive recovery, which is helpful to negate weak attacks and Stealth Rock damage without unnecessary Roost usage. As this set doesn't aim to be a check to specific Pokemon, Leftovers is ideal for sets that want longevity.</li> <li>Charti Berry is an option for teams that want added security against common attackers with Rock-type coverage such as Swords Dance Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Ultra Necrozma.</li> <li>Dread Plate is another option that allows Dark Pulse to cleanly 2HKO the rare Mega Sableye, improving Yveltal's matchup against very defensive teams at the cost of passive recovery.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Stallbreaker Yveltal aims to be a big annoyance to bulky teams, taking weak attacks and taking down defensive Pokemon via Toxic stalling or repeated use of Dark Pulse while limiting their options to fight back with Taunt. Common targets include most defensive Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Celesteela, as well as support Arceus formes.</li> <li>This set should be spreading Toxic and using Taunt to prevent enemy Pokemon from using recovery moves or using utility options against Yveltal and its team.</li> <li>When facing bulky teams, ensure that Yveltal avoids excessive exposure to Toxic itself. This is a common move from defensive teams, and if Yveltal isn't correctly supported with a cleric, it will fall to Toxic damage before having a real impact.</li> <li>This variant can be less useful against offensive teams. Toxic stalling and weaker Dark Pulses can generally be ignored by most offensive Pokemon, but a fast Taunt or Foul Play can prevent them from taking too much advantage of Yveltal. Yveltal is still bulky enough to stand up to attacks and badly poison threatening sweepers such as Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, and wearing down threats that the team can have trouble dealing with.</li> <li>A healthy Yveltal can stand unafraid of Magearna and aim to Taunt it to prevent Heal Bell. If Yveltal takes a Fleur Cannon for the trouble, it can Roost off the damage.</li> <li>Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie are annoying for this Yveltal variant, as Magic Bounce makes Yveltal hesitant to use Taunt or Toxic. Without Dread Plate, Mega Sableye can avoid the 2HKO from Dark Pulse as well, making it more frustrating to break past. Mega Diancie can take advantage of this set rather easily but is a rare sight.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Stallbreaker Yveltal is best suited to balance teams with additional bulky Pokemon and partners that can help this Yveltal set's matchup against offensive teams. This Yveltal variant provides a good way to combat very defensive teams for balance teams that can struggle to break through them otherwise. Providing cleric support for Yveltal and playing around the potential enemy cleric is key to success.</li> <li>Primal Groudon's Swords Dance and Stealth Rock set is a great partner to pressure defensive cores and check troublesome Fairy-types for Yveltal.</li> <li>Choice Scarf Xerneas stands out as an excellent partner that tackles many offensive Pokemon, threatens Mega Sableye, and provides key cleric and Defog support for this Yveltal set.</li> <li>Heal Bell Magearna is an alternative cleric that comes with better longevity while adding the ability to check enemy Dark- and Fairy-type Pokemon.</li> <li>Spikes users such as Ferrothorn are excellent partners, as Yveltal can make great use of the switches it forces to rack up Spikes damage and stall out enemy Defog users.</li> <li>Z-Move or Life Orb Marshadow is a great revenge killer to help Yveltal against offensive teams and pressure defensive cores and Fairy-types together.</li> <li>Celesteela can help against offensive Arceus-Ground variants and Ultra Necrozma, two threats that this set can have trouble with.</li> <li>Calm Mind Arceus-Ground performs very well against offensive teams and can offensively check Swords Dance Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM, which Yveltal can't reliably check.</li> <li>Mega Gengar can make use of Yveltal's status spreading to boost Hex and trap various threats much more easily.</li> <li>Arceus-Water is one of the better support Arceus formes on bulky teams, helping Yveltal against special Primal Groudon variants, offensive Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, and Mega Salamence.</li> </ul> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Foul Play allows Yveltal to revenge kill setup sweepers like Ultra Necrozma, Primal Groudon, and Swords Dance Arceus formes.</li> <li>U-turn generates momentum for Yveltal's team, allowing a teammate to take advantage of the switches that it forces.</li> <li>Toxic cripples many Pokemon that would otherwise switch into this set for free, such as support Arceus formes, Xerneas lacking Aromatherapy, and opposing Yveltal.</li> <li>In the last slot, Defog can be used to remove entry hazards for Yveltal's team; Choice Scarf Yveltal is a particularly effective Defogger because of its high speed and immunity to Sticky Web.</li> <li>Alternatively, Knock Off cripples defensive Pokemon such as Magearna, Ferrothorn, and Blissey and removes Xerneas's Power Herb. It also OHKOes Mega Gengar from full health, which Foul Play cannot do.</li> <li>Oblivion Wing can be used alongside a Timid nature to recover health from checks like Arceus-Fairy, helping Yveltal offset residual damage from the likes of Stealth Rock. However, without Special Attack investment, it is extremely lacking in damage output; for example, it falls well short of OHKOing Marshadow from full health.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>184 Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Yveltal to outpace Choice Scarf Ho-Oh as well as Jolly Primal Groudon and Excadrill after a Speed drop from Rock Tomb.</li> <li>The rest of the EVs are invested into its defenses, letting it survive attacks such as Searing Sunraze Smash from Necrozma-DM, +2 Stone Edge from Arceus-Ground, and +1 Double-Edge from Mega Salamence from full health. Yveltal also survives Close Combat followed by Shadow Sneak from Life Orb Marshadow, as well as +2 Extreme Speed from Extreme Killer Arceus, after Stealth Rock damage.</li> <li>Investing fully in Defense rather than HP proves to be beneficial for this set, as Yveltal already has a high base HP stat, and the Pokemon that it checks are mostly physical attackers. A fully HP-invested EV spread of 248 HP / 76 Def / 184 Spe allows Yveltal to handle Lunala and Mega Gengar better and can be useful for getting an emergency Toxic off versus support Arceus formes, but there is a noticeable loss in physical bulk, and Yveltal will fail to meet many of the above benchmarks.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Bulky Choice Scarf Yveltal is an anti-offense Pokemon that can function both as a pivot and revenge killer.</li> <li>Yveltal should switch into Pokemon that it checks, such as Necrozma-DM and Marshadow, and force them out with the threat of Foul Play.</li> <li>Ideally, it should be brought in on resisted hits or a status move like Stealth Rock. It can also punish the use of Swords Dance from threats like Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground, which may attempt to use a more passive Pokemon as setup bait.</li> <li>Versus bulkier teams, Yveltal should aim to cripple the opponent's check to it with Toxic or Knock Off. This will make it harder for that Pokemon to switch into Yveltal the next time it comes in.</li> <li>It's often safer to use U-turn instead of Foul Play against threats like Ultra Necrozma and Deoxys-A if the opponent still has a healthy answer to Yveltal.</li> <li>If Yveltal is still needed to check a particular threat, conserve its health as much as possible. Unlike other sets, this variant lacks a source of recovery, meaning that it is more prone to being worn down by Stealth Rock and other sources of residual damage over time.</li> <li>Be wary of coverage moves such as Rock Tomb from Marshadow, Stone Edge from Ultra Necrozma, and Ice Beam from Deoxys-A.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Bulky Choice Scarf Yveltal fits on balanced and offensive teams looking for a Pokemon that can act as a revenge killer while also providing some defensive utility as a switch-in to common Psychic-, Ghost-, and Ground-types. It has a good matchup versus offensive teams but can struggle quite a lot versus bulkier ones. Therefore, it needs teammates that can help with its matchup versus the latter.</li> <li>Mega Gengar is an excellent partner, as it can trap and remove Fairy-types and support Arceus formes that Yveltal would otherwise rely on Toxic to break through. It greatly appreciates how Yveltal covers all of its weaknesses, gets it in safely with the assistance of U-turn, and afflicts status on foes to boost the power of its Hex.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM offers a strong check to Fairy-types like Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy, and it appreciates Yveltal bringing it in on them via U-turn. Offensive variants get a free turn to set up, while defensive variants provide a blanket check to support Arceus formes and can set Stealth Rock to support Yveltal's team.</li> <li>Calm Mind Primal Kyogre can dismantle bulky teams and soft check certain special attackers that overwhelm Yveltal, such as mixed Primal Groudon and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground. In return, Yveltal makes up for Kyogre's poor matchup against offense and switches into many of its revenge killers like Primal Groudon, Ultra Necrozma, and Marshadow. Kyogre also enjoys Yveltal removing the items of Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Chansey.</li> <li>Ferrothorn can set Spikes to rack up damage on checks to Yveltal like support Arceus formes, Magearna, and Xerneas; it comfortably switches into most of these checks as well. In return, Yveltal takes care of many setup sweepers that tend to overwhelm Ferrothorn, such as Necrozma-DM, Ultra Necrozma, and Swords Dance Arceus formes.</li> <li>Magearna checks Fairy- and Dark- types such as Xerneas, opposing Yveltal, and Arceus-Dark. It can use Heal Bell to cure status inflicted on Yveltal by the likes of support Necrozma-DM and Zygarde-C, allowing it to switch into said attackers more liberally.</li> <li>Swords Dance or mixed Primal Groudon can set Stealth Rock and pressure bulky teams' defensive cores while providing a backup check to Fairy-types.</li> <li>Fighting-types like Marshadow and Mega Lucario take advantage of U-turn support and can threaten Pokemon like Arceus-Dark, Tyranitar, and Blissey that wall this set.</li> <li>If Yveltal is not running Defog itself, a teammate must provide entry hazard removal support to mitigate its Stealth Rock weakness, as this Yveltal variant is unable to heal off the damage with Oblivion Wing or Roost. Pokemon like Giratina-O, Arceus-Ground, and Excadrill can help with this.</li> </ul> "

Foul Play also does considerable damage to Primal Kyogre, offensive Ho-Oh, and Mega Salamence, as well as foes that are weak to the attack.</li> <li>Roost keeps Yveltal healthy, which is very important to counteract Stealth Rock damage and keep Yveltal away from the KO range of many boosted attacks from the likes of Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence, and other physical attackers.</li> <li>Toxic can punish support Arceus formes and Xerneas, which otherwise switch into Yveltal's other moves easily.</li> <li>Sucker Punch can be a necessary evil to quickly finish off foes that are weakened by Yveltal or its teammates. In situations where Yveltal is slower than foes such as Ultra Necrozma and Double Dance Necrozma-DM and is in the range of a boosted attack, Sucker Punch can make all the difference.</li> <li>Defog is a potential option, as Yveltal can contend with some entry hazard setters such as Primal Groudon, Skarmory and Ferrothorn and remove any Spikes or Stealth Rock set against its team.</li> <li>Taunt is a viable option in the third or fourth moveslot, as it can combine well with any of Toxic, Sucker Punch, and Defog for various results. Taunt and Toxic can greatly annoy defensive walls, Taunt and Sucker Punch can limit foes' moves and allow Yveltal to better handle offensive Pokemon, while Taunt and Defog can prevent defensive Pokemon from using utility moves against Yveltal while it clears any set entry hazards.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>248 HP EVs and 180 Defense EVs give Yveltal maximum physical bulk with the Speed benchmark used, letting it take on many of the physical attackers in the tier. An Impish nature is preferred on sets with Sucker Punch to avoid harming its damage output, but a Bold nature works well on sets without it to reduce damage from opposing Foul Play and confusion.</li> <li>80 Speed EVs ensure that Yveltal is faster than Adamant Necrozma-DM so that it can use Foul Play before taking an attack.</li> <li>Charti Berry is a necessary evil so that Yveltal isn't simply OHKOed by a boosted Stone Edge from the likes of Primal Groudon, Ultra Necrozma, and Swords Dance Arceus-Ground, especially if Stealth Rock damage is not avoidable.</li> <li>Dread Plate is a potential alternative that boosts the power of Foul Play to the point that it can OHKO boosted Extreme Killer Arceus and Mega Lucario, at the cost of fearing boosted Rock-type moves from the aforementioned physical attackers. Dread Plate also gives Sucker Punch a very helpful power boost, giving Yveltal good odds to OHKO Ultra Necrozma after Stealth Rock damage.</li> <li>Leftovers can also be considered to help with passive recovery, but this leaves Yveltal vulnerable to physical attackers with Rock-type coverage.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Physically defensive Yveltal is just as it sounds: a physical wall that aims to check numerous threatening physical attackers such as Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence, Ultra Necrozma, Marshadow, and Swords Dance Arceus-Ground.</li> <li>It should be noted that this Yveltal variant is far from a truly reliable answer to all physical attackers and acts more like a quick fix to a team's weaknesses than like a true physical wall. Yveltal's lack of resistances to many of the boosted attacks it will be taking means that any fight with one of these threats will be a very close call, and certain conditions such as Stealth Rock being up, an unexpected attack, or a lack of Charti Berry can result in Yveltal getting destroyed by the attackers it attempts to check.</li> <li>Yveltal should ideally be kept healthy and should switch into these attackers immediately to attempt to deal with them. If Yveltal comes in too late or is too weakened, it can only aim for a surprise Sucker Punch before going down. The problem with this is that without scouting the sets of Pokemon like Ultra Necrozma, Primal Groudon, and Arceus-Ground, Yveltal may well be switching into an unfavorable matchup if they are specially offensive variants. Assess carefully.</li> <li>Sucker Punch can be a surprise to opponents that see a bulky and slower Yveltal, meaning that frail and faster attackers weak to Sucker Punch may try to KO it. If Yveltal's full moveset isn't revealed, this Yveltal set can keep opponents on their toes.</li> <li>Spreading Toxic and using Taunt on slower Pokemon is still a viable way to get use out of this set. Yveltal's base Speed is higher than the majority of defensive Pokemon, and its bulk means that taking weak attacks is easy.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Physically defensive Yveltal generally isn't meant to be built around, as it isn't reliable enough in practice and has some key weaknesses depending on the item and move choices. This Yveltal variant adds security against physical attackers to teams that find themselves vulnerable near the end of the teambuilding process. Teams that are using more creative builds can find themselves using physically defensive Yveltal to patch up obvious holes.</li> <li>Stealth Rock Primal Groudon sets offer solid checks to Fairy-types and Primal Kyogre, and the entry hazard punishes the switches this Yveltal variant will force from physical attackers.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM is a capable teammate that fits as a specially defensive wall aimed to tackle support Arceus formes and set Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Ferrothorn can check most Fairy-types and set Spikes to punish the switches that Yveltal and its team forces.</li> <li>Arceus-Water and Arceus-Ground can both fit as a check to special Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM. Charti Berry variants of this Yveltal set can handle Swords Dance Ultra Necrozma and Primal Groudon in return.</li> <li>Toxapex is a helpful partner to set Toxic Spikes, annoy Fairy-types, and be difficult to take down for defensive Pokemon that try to wall Yveltal.</li> <li>Choice Scarf Xerneas helps to keep Yveltal from getting overwhelmed by physical attackers such as Marshadow while providing Defog and Aromatherapy support.</li> </ul> "

        "name": "Choice Specs",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Dark Pulse from Choice Specs Yveltal is deadly to teams that lack bulky Dark-resistant Pokemon, as it picks up clean 2HKOs on Mega Diancie and maximum HP Arceus formes, a 3HKO against offensive Xerneas variants, and a 3HKO on Ho-Oh without Life Orb recoil damage.</li> <li>Oblivion Wing 2HKOes offensive Xerneas and Primal Groudon, and the extra power and lack of recoil from Choice Specs boosts Yveltal's own recovery, meaning this set tends to stick around longer.</li> <li>U-turn can let you avoid guessing games between Yveltal's STAB moves and scout for the opponent's switch-ins. U-turn can also have the advantage of disguising Yveltal's set, as both Choice item sets it commonly uses are very likely to have U-turn, adding a surprise factor when Yveltal reveals its damage output against various targets.</li> <li>Heat Wave is Yveltal's preferred coverage move on this set, targeting one of the best checks to Yveltal in Magearna for a clean 2HKO and doing high damage to Klefki. It also OHKOes Ferrothorn and Mega Scizor, two Pokemon that can take Yveltal's other moves at least once.</li> <li>Focus Blast is Yveltal's best option against Tyranitar, OHKOing any set that lacks Chople Berry after Stealth Rock damage. Focus Blast also deals very high damage to Arceus-Dark while retaining higher damage against Magearna than Yveltal's STAB moves, at the cost of lowered accuracy.</li> <li>Hurricane is an alternative very strong attack that can fit into the third or fourth moveslot, dealing more damage than Dark Pulse against neutral targets and 2HKOing Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Fairy, but it comes with shaky accuracy.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>With maximum Special Attack and Speed EVs backed up by Choice Specs and a Timid nature, Yveltal is able to outspeed the crowded Speed tier below it and output more damage than Life Orb sets, at the cost of locked attacks.</li> <li>A Modest nature can be considered for maximum wallbreaking power, increasing the odds of Oblivion Wing 2HKOing support Arceus formes after Stealth Rock damage and increasing the odds for Focus Blast to OHKO Fighting-weak Arceus formes, while giving Dark Pulse even more power.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Choice Specs Yveltal aims to be a wallbreaker, exchanging move flexibility for the freedom to run a Timid nature, stronger attacks, better longevity, and the ability to generate momentum with U-turn when compared to Life Orb sets.</li> <li>This Yveltal variant punishes opponents with fewer strong checks to it, but against teams that employ strong Yveltal answers such as Arceus-Fairy, Magearna, and Tyranitar, it may be forced to use U-turn more often to avoid giving away momentum.</li> <li>Make use of the power given by Choice Specs to break through teams that employ weaker checks to Yveltal such as Ho-Oh and support Arceus formes neutral to Dark Pulse. The lack of Life Orb recoil means that Recover stalling this Yveltal variant isn't an option for bulky teams.</li> <li>A well timed Heat Wave against teams using Magearna can open a playground for Yveltal to spam Dark Pulse and force the opponent to aggressively take Yveltal down with faster attackers or else risk losing crucial walls.</li> <li>Choice Specs-boosted Oblivion Wing can make Yveltal annoying to take down due to the amount of healing it can generate for itself.</li> <li>Common Pokemon do resist Yveltal's STAB attacks, so be careful what Yveltal is locked into or things can backfire.</li> <li>If you are in doubt about the attack to choose, U-turn can be a safe play, provided Yveltal has teammates to take advantage of any momentum generated and a fallback if the opponent doesn't switch out.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Choice Specs Yveltal focuses purely on wallbreaking and momentum generation. Balance and bulky offense team structures are able to utilize some defensive teammates to help cover for this set's main weaknesses, namely Fairy-types and faster attackers.</li> <li>Mega Gengar stands out as one of the best partners to Choice Specs Yveltal. It can trap and eliminate Arceus-Fairy and Xerneas, and can do so with greater ease with the help of Yveltal's U-turn. Yveltal's ability to switch into many attacks that trouble Mega Gengar lets them pair well defensively, and the two can combine to form a formidable wallbreaking duo. An important trait that Mega Gengar brings is the ability to revenge kill Ultra Necrozma, which can be very threatening to balance teams.</li> <li>Mega Scizor can work alongside Yveltal to check Fairy-types and form a U-turn core where each member can help get the other get into battle against its ideal targets. Magearna can perform a similar role with Volt Switch.</li> <li>Defensive Zygarde-C can use Glare to slow down support Arceus formes so that this Yveltal variant can break through them, and it is also a good check to Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Primal Groudon always fits well with Yveltal, checking Fairy-types and Primal Kyogre while also bringing utility with Stealth Rock setting, additional wallbreaking, or sweeping potential based on the chosen set.</li> <li>Choice Scarf Xerneas can act as a check to many offensive Pokemon to help make up for Yveltal's lack of Sucker Punch while also providing cleric support.</li> <li>Arceus-Water can be a key support Arceus forme to assist Yveltal against the likes of Ho-Oh, Mega Salamence, and special Primal Groudon variants.</li> </ul> "

        "name": "Choice Band",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Knock Off is this set's most spammable move and deals large amounts of damage to Pokemon with removable items. It cripples checks to Yveltal like Magearna and offensive Xerneas while taking away nearly half of their health, and it can OHKO special walls like Blissey and offensive Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Foul Play is also boosted by Choice Band, and it does more damage to Pokemon with irremovable items such as Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Mega Salamence, and Z-Move Necrozma-DM. It also allows Yveltal to punish the use of boosting moves from setup sweepers like Extreme Killer Arceus and Primal Groudon.</li> <li>U-turn generates momentum for Yveltal's team and deals a hefty amount of damage to Dark-types such as Arceus-Dark and Tyranitar, usually 2HKOing the latter.</li> <li>Sucker Punch adds to Yveltal's revenge killing capabilities, letting it pick off fast threats such as Ultra Necrozma and Mega Mewtwo Y before they can hit it with one of their coverage moves. Note that being locked into Sucker Punch can place Yveltal in an extremely exploitable situation, however.</li> <li>Toxic cripples support Arceus formes, which otherwise wall this set with ease.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>A Jolly nature is preferred so Yveltal outspeeds Lunala and positive-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon, such as Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>An Adamant nature is viable to guarantee that Yveltal OHKOes offensive Ho-Oh and support Necrozma-DM and 2HKOes Klefki and Skarmory with Knock Off. It also gives Yveltal a roughly 50% chance to OHKO Marshadow and Necrozma-DM lacking defensive investment with Sucker Punch.</li> <li>A bulkier EV spread of 192 Atk / 64 Def / 252 Spe can be used with a Jolly nature to survive Double-Edge from Jolly Mega Salamence after Stealth Rock damage as well as Stone Edge from Ultra Necrozma from full health.</li> <li>An EV spread of 132 Atk / 124 Def / 252 Spe with an Adamant nature meets the above benchmarks and also allows Yveltal to take a +2 Extreme Speed from Extreme Killer Arceus variants that lack a boosting item after Stealth Rock damage. Despite the reduced Attack investment, Knock Off still retains OHKOs on offensive Ho-Oh and support Necrozma-DM, and the damage output of Foul Play is not affected. Note that this spread should not be used with a Jolly nature because the loss in damage output is too significant.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Choice Band Yveltal aims to wallbreak and cripple the opposing team as much as possible so its teammates have an easier time cleaning up.</li> <li>Versus bulky teams, try to aggressively bring Yveltal in on passive Pokemon like Blissey, Ferrothorn, and support Necrozma-DM via double switches or pivoting moves. Use Knock Off or Toxic to cripple your opponent's check to Yveltal so they will have a harder time switching into it later in the game.</li> <li>Foul Play and Sucker Punch are Yveltal's main tools for dealing with offense. However, avoid using Sucker Punch unless Yveltal's team is prepared to deal with setup sweepers that can take advantage of it being locked into the move, such as Geomancy Xerneas. Be wary of using Sucker Punch against potential Substitute users such as Mega Gengar, Zygarde-C, and Swords Dance Arceus-Ground as well.</li> <li>Use U-turn as a midground play or when the opponent has a Pokemon that shuts down all of this set's other options, such as Magearna or an Arceus forme with Refresh.</li> <li>Manage Yveltal's health wisely, as this variant lacks recovery and is prone to getting worn down by Stealth Rock and other sources of residual damage. Do not recklessly switch it into Pokemon like Marshadow that it may take a lot of damage from or cannot revenge kill consistently.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Choice Band Yveltal fits on offensive teams that are looking for a wallbreaker to help with their matchup against bulky teams. It appreciates Pokemon that can provide its team with anti-offense measures as well as teammates that can take advantage of the walls that it struggles with.</li> <li>Mega Gengar is a phenomenal partner for this set. It traps and removes the opponent's Fairy-types and support Arceus formes, making Yveltal much harder to wall, and can revenge kill Ultra Necrozma with consistency. In return, Yveltal gets it in safely with U-turn, pivots into Psychic-, Ghost-, and Ground-type attacks for it, and weakens Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar and Alolan Muk.</li> <li>Xerneas is a great partner, as this set lures several checks to it such as Ho-Oh, Magearna, and Blissey and KOes or cripples them. Geomancy variants have an easier time sweeping, while Choice Scarf variants can help to revenge kill threats like Marshadow and Ultra Necrozma more consistently.</li> <li>Glare Zygarde-C can paralyze support Arceus formes, increasing the odds of Yveltal breaking through them with Knock Off. Yveltal also poses a much greater threat to offensive teams once its revenge killers like Xerneas have been paralyzed.</li> <li>Magearna and Mega Scizor check Fairy-types and form pivoting cores with Yveltal. Magearna in particular tends to lure in many of the special walls that are the targets of Choice Band Yveltal, such as Blissey, Ferrothorn, and Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Primal Groudon sets Stealth Rock for Yveltal's team, and it can pressure support Arceus formes with a mixed or Swords Dance set. It can also take advantage of Fairy-types, especially once Xerneas's Power Herb has been removed.</li> <li>Fast, frail Pokemon like Marshadow, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Deoxys-A appreciate Yveltal getting them in safely via U-turn and removing Choice Scarf from Xerneas and opposing Yveltal.</li> <li>Entry hazard setters like Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and support Necrozma-DM can help this set break through support Arceus formes. These Pokemon can also pivot into support Arceus formes and Fairy-types for Yveltal thanks to their typing, good bulk, and access to recovery.</li> <li>This variant of Yveltal lacks a source of recovery, so hazard removal support is strongly recommended. Defoggers like Arceus-Ground, Giratina-O, and Ho-Oh can fulfill this role.</li> </ul> "

  "Zygarde": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Zygarde is one of the more versatile threats in the tier due to a number of unique traits it has over other Pokemon.</li> <li>While it is not a very notable threat in its base forme, Zygarde gains immense bulk after transforming via Power Construct. This aids Zygarde by either easing its setup or making it a nigh-impenetrable physical wall.</li> <li>Offensive sets employing Dragon Dance in particular are very difficult for many teams to properly handle. Zygarde's signature move, Thousand Arrows, hits almost the entire relevant tier for at least neutral damage and leaves Zygarde with more freedom to choose other moves. Depending on what utility move Zygarde opts for, foes that attempt to check Zygarde may have to contend with phazing, status, or even trapping.</li> <li>Defensive variants of Zygarde also have invaluable traits. Thanks to its typing and bulk, Zygarde is capable of handling some of the most common and dangerous threats in the tier, such as Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Ho-Oh, with ease. On top of being a durable defensive behemoth, Zygarde has access to excellent utility moves like Dragon Tail and Glare, both of which excel at punishing a variety of foes that may attempt to take advantage of Zygarde's passivity.</li> <li>It is important to note, however, that Zygarde's every mentioned potential is fulfilled only under the assumption that it undergoes Power Construct safely. Prior to transformation, Zygarde is rather exploitable due to its lacking bulk and vulnerability to Fairy- and Ice-types.</li> <li>While offensive variants of Zygarde-C are difficult to stop, several conditions must be met for it to be successful, including prior damage dealt on its checks, dedicated entry hazard support, and even an elimination of a threat in some cases. For these reasons, unlike defensive variants, offensive variants of Zygarde are heavily reliant on their teammates to be effective, and the team must be built around them.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>A Dragon Dance set can use Extreme Speed so Zygarde can pick off faster offensive checks like weakened Choice Scarf Xerneas and Deoxys-A.</li> <li>Earth Plate provides a consistent boost to Thousand Arrows's damage output, notably letting +1 Zygarde OHKO Marshadow after recoil damage from Life Orb.</li> <li>Iron Tail in tandem with Steelium Z allows Zygarde to OHKO both Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy after a Dragon Dance, but it doesn't have much use otherwise.</li> <li>Coil may be used alongside Dragon Dance, which makes Zygarde harder to take down as it continues to boost its damage output, bulk, and Speed. Simply using 28 Defense EVs allows Zygarde to make a Substitute that cannot be broken by any one hit from defensive variants of Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Ho-Oh, after it has transformed.</li> <li>Mago Berry allows Zygarde to quickly heal itself in a pinch, letting it set up more reliably under offensive pressure. However, lacking Leftovers or a Z-Crystal isn't very ideal.</li> <li>Haze can be used over Coil on the defensive set to deter setup and check opposing Zygarde-C with Dragon Dance + Substitute and Bulk Up variants of Marshadow, but this leaves Zygarde vulnerable to Gothitelle.</li> <li>A combination of Block and Normalium Z is an alternative way of allowing Zygarde to trap and set up on a foe, but it has no notable benefits over simply using Thousand Waves apart from letting Zygarde trap airborne foes with ease and reliably set up on Life Orb Ho-Oh with a Defense boost from Z-Block.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Fairy-types like Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy tend to be the best checks to Zygarde thanks to their immunity to Dragon Tail and ability to hit it super effectively with their STAB moves. Xerneas in particular is one of the more dangerous foes for Zygarde, as Zygarde cannot prevent Xerneas from setting up Geomancy without employing the uncommon Haze, and Xerneas variants with Aromatherapy do not mind switching into Glare.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Attacks</strong>: Zygarde suffers from the popularity of Ice-type attacks in the tier, as it has an extreme weakness to them. This means Zygarde struggles to combat support Arceus formes that commonly employ Ice Beam and Hidden Power Ice users like Primal Groudon and Marshadow.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Zygarde gains huge bulk after transforming, but due to rather mediocre Special Defense and a lack of notable resistances, it is easily overwhelmed by strong special attackers like Yveltal and Lunala. Draco Meteor from Rayquaza, Giratina-O, and Naganadel and Spacial Rend from Palkia mostly end up being lethal blows for Zygarde in its base forme, and they are still capable of heavily damaging Zygarde in its Complete forme, even if they won't outright OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Faster Foes: Zygarde fails to outspeed Deoxys-A and Choice Scarf users like Xerneas and Yveltal after Dragon Dance boosts and thus is vulnerable to getting revenge killed. Should Zygarde have opted for a bulkier EV spread, it is also prone to getting revenge killed by foes like Mega Gengar and Mewtwo.</p> <p><strong>Offensive Pressure Prior to Power Construct: Failure to properly transform Zygarde will greatly limit its ability to set up and take hits. Due to Zygarde's tendency to punctually take mildly strong attacks to safely go through transformation, it is heavily pressured by threats that can hit it with boosted attacks. Examples include Swords Dance variants of Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Mega Lucario, though they do not wish to confront Zygarde in its Complete forme. Zygarde also is overwhelmed by the presence of multiple special attackers, as it is often forced out against it them. If pressured to the point where it cannot safely transform at appropriate time, Zygarde's efficiency as a blanket check to physical attackers significantly diminishes.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Though most Taunt users do not appreciate switching into Glare or Thousand Arrows, they can hinder Zygarde's effectiveness by preventing its setup and recovery. Preventing Dragon Dance leaves Zygarde much easier to offensively handle due to its lack of immediate power, while preventing Rest significantly hinders Zygarde's ability to manage its HP as a defensive wall.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Dragon Dance compensates Zygarde's lacking damage output and lets it outspeed many Pokemon after a boost, turning it into an offensive threat.</li> <li>Thousand Arrows is a spammable STAB move that hits almost the entire tier for at least neutral damage while naturally threatening extremely common threats like Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Ho-Oh. Groundium Z makes the move into an immensely powerful Tectonic Rage that is capable of OHKOing Zygarde's offensive checks like Xerneas with or without prior damage.</li> <li>Zygarde can opt to use Substitute thanks to its massive bulk and Thousand Arrows freeing up a moveslot that would otherwise go to a coverage move. Substitute greatly aids Zygarde by letting it effectively manage HP to safely activate Power Construct, letting it avoid status moves and Dragon Tail from Giratina and opposing defensive Zygarde, easing predictions, and punishing its switch-in with Dragon Tail or Glare.</li> <li>Dragon Tail may not seem to be the most viable option on an offensive Dragon Dance set, but it prevents Zygarde from getting phazed by Lugia and Skarmory, as a boosted Zygarde can phaze them first before it is phazed by Whirlwind. Dragon Tail also helps Zygarde punish Arceus formes and its other offensive checks by forcing them to switch into a random teammate while doing a considerable amount of damage and drawing them closer to KO range. It is important to note that if Zygarde is running Dragonium Z with Dragon Tail, it will have favorable matchup against occasional Ditto and Dragon-types like Mega Salamence and Giratina-O, as Devastating Drake does not have negative priority like Dragon Tail, so Zygarde can strike them first.</li> <li>Glare punishes offensive foes that attempt to switch in and check Zygarde, and paralysis can occasionally give Zygarde a free turn to set up or attack.</li> <li>Protect guards Zygarde for a turn, protecting it from attacks while letting it gain an extra turn of recovery from Leftovers and possibly stall more residual damage on a foe. Repeated use of Substitute and Protect can effectively stall out a foe, as Zygarde only ends up using a small portion of its health to do so.</li> <li>Outrage can be used over Dragon Tail so Zygarde can use a stronger Devastating Drake, which, when boosted, can quickly dispose of Mega Salamence, Giratina-O, and opposing Zygarde.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>232 Speed EVs allow Zygarde to outspeed Mega Gengar and Marshadow in its Complete forme after a Dragon Dance, preventing the latter from stealing Zygarde's boosts before Zygarde gets to attack. If outspeeding more threats is desired, 248 Speed EVs can be used to allow Zygarde to outspeed Rash Deoxys-A after a Dragon Dance. 30 HP IVs should be used if Zygarde is not running any HP EVs and is not holding Leftovers so it can activate Power Construct after using Substitute twice.</li> <li>12 HP EVs maximize Zygarde's Leftovers recovery in its Complete forme. If Zygarde is holding a Z-Crystal, they make Zygarde's HP number divisible by four so that Power Construct activates after two uses of Substitute.</li> <li>48 Special Defense EVs allow Zygarde to survive an Ice Beam from support Arceus formes from full HP in its base forme. The rest of the EVs are put into Attack, combined with an Adamant nature, to maximize Zygarde's damage output.</li> <li>A bulkier EV spread of 12 HP / 160 Atk / 56 Def / 48 SpD / 232 Spe and an Impish nature allow Zygarde to survive +2 Sunsteel Strike from Necrozma-DM, +2 Photon Geyser from Ultra Necrozma, and uninvested Ice Beam from support Arceus formes, as well as ensuring that Zygarde-C's Substitute will always block defensive Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike. This EV investment comes at the cost of a noticeable drop in damage output, however.</li> <li>A different EV spread of 44 HP / 252 Atk / 12 Def / 200 Spe can be used if Zygarde isn't running Leftovers, as this maximizes Zygarde's damage output, allows it to activate Power Construct after using Substitute twice, and ensures that Zygarde outspeeds Marshadow at +1 in its Complete forme. Note that Zygarde's inability to outspeed Mega Gengar at +1 in Complete forme can be detrimental.</li> <li>Leftovers provides Zygarde with passive recovery, allowing it to set up Substitute multiple times and aiding its attempt to stall a foe with paralysis from Glare.</li> <li>Groundium Z allows Zygarde to use Tectonic Rage, which, at +1, is capable of outright taking out Xerneas, defensive Primal Groudon, and support Arceus formes after some prior damage.</li> <li>Dragonium Z is an alternative Z-Crystal that can be used so Zygarde can hit Dragon-types with Devastating Drake for super effective damage.</li> <li>Power Construct transforms Zygarde into its Complete forme when it has lost a half or more of its HP, giving it a massive boost in HP and letting it ease setup and set more Substitutes.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Dragon Dance Zygarde requires a number of conditions to be fulfilled for it to effectively sweep or cause serious damage to the opponent's team. As it is reliant on prior damage on foes like support Arceus formes even when opting to use a Z-Crystal, outright attempting to sweep with Zygarde is never a sensible strategy unless another teammate requires Zygarde to damage a foe that it draws in.</li> <li>Support Arceus formes are one of the most problematic foes for Zygarde to confront, as they are commonly prepared to check Zygarde and have sufficient bulk to survive a Z-Move when healthy. They are required to be damaged for Zygarde to bypass them. Statusing them with Toxic is a good idea, as this allows Zygarde to rack up the residual damage with Substitute.</li> <li>Setting up entry hazards is also helpful, as this leaves Zygarde with an option to wear down its checks with Dragon Tail to the point where they can no longer effectively handle boosted attacks.</li> <li>Even after Zygarde's traditional checks like support Arceus formes and Xerneas have been eliminated, recklessly setting up Dragon Dance is discouraged, especially if Zygarde is using a bulkier EV spread. As some foes like Mega Gengar, Ultra Necrozma, and Deoxys-A can outspeed boosted Zygarde depending on its EV spread, one must draft a plan to deal with them beforehand if Zygarde is not capable of outspeeding them at +1. All relevant Choice Scarf users are also capable of revenge killing boosted Zygarde, so possible Choice Scarf users like Xerneas and Yveltal have to be scouted with caution.</li> <li>Zygarde's primary setup targets are passive foes that rely on status, such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex, and Chansey. It is best to set Substitute against them first to avoid status moves and grant Zygarde temporary protection should the opponent immediately switch into Zygarde's checks; this allows Zygarde to either wear them down with Dragon Tail or paralyze them without getting harmed. Frequently setting Substitute also allows Zygarde to safely activate Power Construct.</li> <li>Both Glare and Protect provide Zygarde with valuable utility options even when it is not able to successfully set up. Glare allows Zygarde to check Rock Polish Primal Groudon while essentially punishing every foe that tries to take it on by paralyzing them. Paralyzed foes can easily be taken advantage of by Zygarde's teammates, and paralysis can even provide Zygarde with a free turn to set up. Protect, while it is very handy for further improving Zygarde's ability to stall a statused foe, can also be used to scout a foe's move while providing Zygarde with an extra turn of recovery.</li> <li>Although this variant of Zygarde isn't very durable and lacks recovery apart from Leftovers, it can still be used as an offensive check to Primal Groudon and Extreme Killer Arceus.</li> <li>Zygarde using a Z-Crystal becomes predictable once it reveals that it lacks Leftovers, and an opponent may attempt to predict a Z-Move. Be prepared to make predictions, especially if an opponent's only check to a boosted Zygarde has to avoid a Z-Move to prevent the sweep.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Zygarde appreciates entry hazard support. All variations of entry hazards are beneficial for Zygarde in different ways. It is recommended for hazard setters to carry some form of a status move, as they naturally draw in Defog users, which Zygarde can easily deal with later if they are statused.</li> <li>Stealth Rock support allows Zygarde to better deal with Lugia if Dragon Tail is not used, and it also helps punish defensive Yveltal and Salamence, should the latter attempt switching in to hinder Zygarde's setup with Intimidate. Offensive teams can have a dedicated Stealth Rock setter, such as Excadrill and Deoxys-S. On more balanced teams, Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM can provide Stealth Rock support while functioning as solid checks to Fairy-types.</li> <li>Spikes support is particularly helpful for Zygarde using a Z-Crystal, as this wears down grounded foes much faster. Both Cloyster and Deoxys-S can set Spikes for Zygarde on offensive teams to pressure the opposing team early-game. Cloyster can also set Toxic Spikes, and Zygarde can take advantage of this well, as many foes that are immune to said entry hazard can be set up on by Zygarde or cannot contend with Zygarde. Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Klefki can set Spikes, check certain support Arceus formes, and spread status.</li> <li>A myriad of offensive Pokemon can benefit from the damage that Zygarde-C spreads onto the opposing team or can assist Zygarde-C themselves in a similar way.</li> <li>Xerneas benefits from Zygarde-C threatening Primal Groudon and Steel-types, can deal with defensive Yveltal, and easily clean a weakened team after a Geomancy. Choice Scarf variants can cure Zygarde of status and provide revenge killing utilities against faster foes.</li> <li>Mega Gengar is one of the best offensive partners to Zygarde, as it can take advantage of weakened teams, trap and eliminate Fairy-types, and even force a trade with Destiny Bond against a foe that has to be eliminated for Zygarde to be successful. Hex variants in particular appreciate Zygarde spreading paralysis with Glare, and Mega Gengar can soften a passive wall with Will-O-Wisp, providing a better setup condition for Zygarde against the likes of defensive Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Other setup sweepers like Rock Polish Primal Groudon and powerhouses like Yveltal and Primal Kyogre can wreak havoc on opponent's defensive backbones early-game for Zygarde.</li> <li>Gothitelle can remove support Arceus formes and other passive foes for Zygarde. Its ability to neutralize a foe and provide Zygarde with a safe environment to set up is generally appreciated.</li> </ul> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Rest is mandatory, as it is the only way Zygarde can recover health. In addition, the move provides Zygarde with more opportunities to activate Power Construct.</li> <li>Coil boosts Zygarde's bulk to further levels, letting it prevail against Swords Dance variants of Primal Groudon, Arceus, and Arceus-Ground. Coil also prevents Zygarde from being set up on by the latter two using Substitute.</li> <li>Sleep Talk prevents Zygarde from being completely passive while it is asleep.</li> <li>Thousand Arrows prevents Zygarde from being completely passive against Xerneas and Magearna. Thousand Arrows is also helpful for punishing Mega Gengar, checking Mega Lucario, and wearing down Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Glare harshly punishes foes, should they switch into Zygarde to force it out. It also proves extremely useful due to its ability to paralyze Primal Groudon, letting Zygarde be one of the few Pokemon that can shut down Rock Polish variants.</li> <li>Dragon Tail allows Zygarde to reliably check its foes by phazing them, and it can also be used to rack up good amounts of damage with entry hazards on the field. More notably, it prevents Zygarde from being trapped by Gothitelle.</li> <li>Toxic is another possible utility option that lets Zygarde more reliably check Primal Groudon by putting it on timer while punishing its checks like support Arceus formes harder than Glare would.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum investment in HP and Defense and an Impish nature allow Zygarde to fulfill its role as a defensive wall. The EV spread is also the most sensible option to allow Zygarde to take on boosted Primal Groudon and Mega Lucario prior to its transformation, as Zygarde cannot survive +2 Precipice Blades or +2 Close Combat from said foes while running less bulk investment.</li> <li>Leftovers provides Zygarde with passive recovery, leaving it less reliant on Rest and letting it narrowly avoid two consecutive Close Combats from Mega Lucario.</li> <li>Power Construct, once activated, turns Zygarde into a formidable physical wall that becomes very difficult to surmount with physical attackers without brute force.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Zygarde should be switched into weak or resisted attacks from Pokemon such as defensive variants of Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Ho-Oh. Zygarde can also switch into a predicted status move from foes that cannot pose an immediate threat, as the residual damage will eventually activate Power Construct, and Zygarde can simply use Rest to rid itself of its status ailment anyway.</li> <li>Even when taking weak attacks, one must carefully observe the amount of damage that Zygarde takes and draft plans about making defensive reactions. Necrozma-DM has a considerable chance to carry a Z-Crystal, which is capable of taking out Zygarde prior to transformation at an unexpected situation.</li> <li>Coverage moves are another factor that Zygarde must be concerned of, as foes it would otherwise check, such as Primal Groudon and Rayquaza, may carry moves like Hidden Power Ice or Draco Meteor. This necessitates scouting before one decides to stay in against them, unless there are no other teammates that can feasibly deal with them.</li> <li>When running a moveset with Coil, carefully observe threats that Zygarde will be tasked to deal with. For example, when taking on Primal Groudon, take note of how much damage it does with physical attacks. If the damage output is far above defensive variants', it is better for Zygarde to start setting up Coil, as there is a considerable chance that it may be taking on a Swords Dance variant. Another case when Coil should be set up with haste is when dealing with Swords Dance Arceus formes, as they commonly carry Substitute or use Z-Moves to defeat Zygarde prior to transformation.</li> <li>As Zygarde lacking Coil or Dragon Tail is set up on by Substitute users like opposing Zygarde, Arceus-Ground, and Extreme Killer Arceus, ensure that they are scouted beforehand to prevent them from gaining free turns of setup.</li> <li>Zygarde's health should be managed even after transformation, especially if he opponent has wallbreakers employing a setup move, a Z-Move, or both. Zygarde won't always be in the healthiest condition after transformation, and failure to properly manage its health may leave it unable to check them.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Thanks to Zygarde's ability to check the majority of physical attackers in the tier with its sheer bulk, it can easily form a defensive core with teammates that can patch up its vulnerability to special attackers.</li> <li>Zygarde desires a teammate that can deal with Fairy-types and support Arceus formes, which commonly carry Ice Beam. Ferrothorn and Magearna are solid partners in this regard. Ferrothorn makes Zygarde's Dragon Tail more useful with Spikes, allows Zygarde to safely manage its health with Leech Seed, and appreciates Zygarde's ability to take on most Primal Groudon variants and Fighting-types. Magearna is also a reliable switch-in to support Arceus formes and, unlike Ferrothorn, serves as a strong check to Xerneas.</li> <li>Zygarde can assist and benefit from a number of very common Pokemon as well. Primal Groudon enjoys the spread of paralysis, as this allows it to threaten faster foes it would otherwise cautiously contend against. Zygarde functioning as a status absorber and occasionally removing Ground immunities from Pokemon is also appreciated. Primal Groudon sets up Stealth Rock so Zygarde can take advantage of it with Dragon Tail, and it can check Xerneas and Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>Mega Gengar, especially Hex variants, benefit from the spread of paralysis, as this boosts Hex and may occasionally provide Mega Gengar with room to breathe. In return, Mega Gengar can remove Fairy-types and any relevant clerics apart from Magearna, which would otherwise limit Zygarde's usefulness. Zygarde can handle Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh, which Mega Gengar normally does not enjoy facing.</li> <li>Ho-Oh is a great check to Xerneas and the majority of support Arceus formes that can threaten Zygarde with Ice Beam, and it can render physical attackers useless with Sacred Fire burns. As a number of physical attackers like Primal Groudon and Mega Salamence can overwhelm Ho-Oh, Zygarde's ability to blanket check the majority of them is appreciated. Ho-Oh also checks Marshadow lacking Rock Tomb, while Zygarde can check Marshadow lacking Hidden Power Ice.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM similarly benefits from utility options that Zygarde provides. Defensive variants can set Stealth Rock and punish support Arceus formes with Toxic.</li> <li>Various support Arceus formes aid Zygarde. Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Water can function as a secondary check to Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM, which Zygarde will have a much shakier matchup against when it is asleep. As most support Arceus formes despise Toxic, Zygarde's ability to switch into said move is always appreciated. Zygarde can also check boosted Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM, as most Arceus formes struggle properly handling boosted attacks from them.</li> <li>Both Magearna and Blissey are excellent checks to Fairy-types, and they can alleviate Zygarde lacking Sleep Talk thanks to their access to Heal Bell.</li> </ul> "

        "name": "Thousand Waves",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Dragon Dance and Thousand Arrows are mandatory for any Zygarde variant attempting to sweep.</li> <li>Thousand Waves prevents a foe from switching once it has been hit by the move. Depending on what foe Zygarde traps, it can either fully set up or safely switch to a teammate that can deal with the foe.</li> <li>Rest fully restores Zygarde's health and removes status, letting it consistently take hits from foes like defensive Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh that can't immediately threaten it and fully set up.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>220 Attack EVs with an Adamant nature allow Zygarde to OHKO any relevant Arceus forme, including Arceus-Ground, with +6 Thousand Arrows after Stealth Rock damage.</li> <li>80 HP EVs let Zygarde survive an Ice Beam from a support Arceus forme, if it proves to be a necessity. The rest of the EVs are invested in Defense, letting Zygarde avoid the 4HKO from defensive Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades most of the time with Leftovers recovery so it can reliably set up Dragon Dance while consistently taking hits.</li> <li>Power Construct allows Zygarde to transform into its Complete forme when its HP is under 50% at the end of the turn.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>This set takes advantage of Zygarde's checks' tendencies to switch into it by trapping them on switch using Thousand Waves and switching to a teammate that can deal with them. Therefore, Thousand Waves is what Zygarde should usually use. However, Zygarde can situationally use Dragon Dance to punish foes like support Arceus formes that switch into it.</li> <li>On the other hand, Zygarde can fully set up on foes that are not powerful enough to surmount its Complete forme such as defensive Primal Groudon, Ferrothorn, defensive Necrozma-DM, and Excadrill. Occasionally, these foes may stay in against Zygarde to either set entry hazards or status it before switching out. Zygarde can take advantage of this to trap them with Thousand Waves and fully set up on them.</li> <li>Once a foe has been trapped, Zygarde can simply repeat setting up Dragon Dance and using Rest when its health is low. While a fully boosted Zygarde may seem impossible to stop, certain foes like Lugia, Skarmory, and opposing Zygarde can still survive +6 Thousand Arrows and phaze Zygarde. Setting entry hazards up before attempting to sweep with Zygarde is a good plan in this regard.</li> <li>Defensive teams typically rely on support Arceus formes or phazing to check setup sweepers. Due to this, Zygarde can be preserved until late-game. Once it doesn't have any teammates left, Zygarde can freely set up, as many common Pokemon on defensive teams are not capable of sufficiently pressuring it. Ensure that problematic foes like support Arceus formes have been eliminated beforehand, however.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>This set appreciates similar team support to other Dragon Dance sets, but certain Pokemon pair with this variant of Zygarde especially well. Mega Gengar and Gothitelle are the most notable ones, as after Zygarde traps a passive foe with Thousand Waves on the switch, they can promptly switch in and proceed to trap and remove them. Mega Gengar can either eliminate or force a trade with a problematic foe, while Gothitelle can trap and remove almost every relevant support Arceus forme.</li> <li>Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Arceus-Fairy are all valid users of Stealth Rock. When Zygarde is paired with Gothitelle, any support Arceus forme that attempts to use Defog to remove entry hazards can be trapped early-game, providing Zygarde with better opportunities to set up.</li> <li>Spikes support, while not effective as Stealth Rock, can still aid Zygarde, as Stealth Rock and a layer of Spikes give +6 Zygarde a good chance to OHKO opposing defensive Zygarde in its base forme. Ferrothorn is a good Spikes setter for this reason, as its tendency to draw in Primal Groudon is also appreciated.</li> <li>Various wallbreakers like Yveltal, Primal Kyogre, and Marshadow can be paired with set, as they aid Zygarde's sweep in a situation where there are no foes that Zygarde can trap and use as setup fodder.</li> </ul> "

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Magic Bounce is a really useful ability, as it's able to prevent entry hazards from being set on the field and also prevents Mega Diancie's foes from trying to spread status.</li> <li>Boasting a base 160 in both offensive stats, Mega Diancie is able to utilize a mixed set incredibly well, being able to quite effectively dent through dedicated special and physical walls, such as Blissey and Giratina.</li> <li>Rock / Fairy is a useful offensive typing, as it allows Mega Diancie to check many defensive threats such as Ho-Oh, Lugia, Mega Sableye, Blissey, and Tyranitar as well as some offensive threats such as Yveltal, Mega Salamence, and Rayquaza as long as the latter two don't run Earthquake.</li> <li>At the same time, Mega Diancie loses to some of the most common offensive threats in the tier such as Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, Primal Kyogre, Mega Lucario, and Arceus Ground.</li> <li>Although it has a useful ability in Magic Bounce, Mega Diancie still loses to most of the common entry hazard setters in the tier such as Primal Groudon, Excadrill, Ferrothorn, and Skill Swap Deoxys-S sets, so it has to rely on other Pokemon in the tier to effectively keep entry hazards off the field. As a result, Mega Diancie can only really utilize its ability against more passive playstyles such as stall.</li> <li>Although base 110 in both defenses is quite respectable, its low HP combined with the fact that it has to run a nature that reduces bulk results in Mega Diancie being rather frail, even when those stats are boosted.</li> <li>Although a base 110 Speed is relatively impressive on paper, it should be noted that many of Mega Diancie's checks actually outspeed it, as support Arceus formes opt to run enough Speed investment to outpace Mega Lucario and other threats such as Xerneas commonly use a Choice Scarf.</li> <li>Due to the fact that Mega Diancie takes up a Mega slot and the fact that Necrozma-DM and Arceus Ground are two of the most common Pokemon in the tier, it is often hard to justify Mega Diancie's placement on a team.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Hidden Power Fire can be a nice surprise attack, potentially OHKOing Mega Scizor after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKOing Ferrothorn, which are both otherwise relatively unfazed by Mega Diancie's attacks. However, this can only be used when predicting either of these Pokemon switching in, as both of them are able to OHKO Mega Diancie.</li> <li>Calm Mind can be a useful move, as it boosts Mega Diancie's Special Attack and Special Defense by one stage, making it a lot harder to switch into and a lot harder for defensive teams to wear down, since Magic Bounce grants Mega Diancie an immunity to Taunt and status moves. However, Mega Diancie only really gets to take advantage of Calm Mind in matchups against stall, which, considering that Mega Diancie's best matchup is already against stall, makes it hard to justify over any of its other common moves.</li> <li>Protect can be used to allow Diancie to Mega Evolve without having to take any damage doing so. It can also be useful for scouting for super effective coverage moves. However, Diancie struggles to find the moveslot to run it, as it already struggles between the options of Heal Bell, Endeavor, and Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Magnet Rise can be useful for dealing with Primal Groudon, as Mega Diancie can then 2HKO it with Earth Power. However, most Pokemon with Ground-type attacks are still able to beat Mega Diancie in a one-on-one situation, as Zygarde is able to hit it with Thousand Arrows regardless and Arceus-Ground outspeeds it.</li> <li>Rock Polish can boost Mega Diancie's Speed, potentially giving it more offensive presence, and making it harder to be revenge killed by faster Pokemon in the tier such as Marshadow; however, Mega Diancie still faces the issues of failing to KO many of the Pokemon that threaten it, as Mega Lucario and Mega Scizor have access to priority Bullet Punch, and Necrozma-DM and Arceus-Ground can KO Mega Diancie in return. Rock Polish also prevents it from running more effective moves such as Stealth Rock and Heal Bell.</li> <li>Power Gem and a Timid nature can be run in place of Diamond Storm on a Calm Mind Set to make Mega Diancie a full special sweeper, but it should be noted that it struggles immensely against special walls, as it has to get to +6 in order to be able to 2HKO Chansey with Moonblast.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Diancie has a 4x weakness to Steel-type attacks and therefore finds even the most passive of Steel-type Pokemon to be very threatening. Although Mega Diancie runs Earth Power or occasionally Hidden Power Fire as an attempt to combat Steel-type Pokemon, there are many Steel-types in the tier that are relatively unfazed by those moves, as they have a significant amount of natural bulk or a secondary typing that makes them take neutral damage from them. For example, Celesteela is a hard-counter to Mega Diancie, as it fails to 2HKO Celesteela, even if it opts to run Hidden Power Fire, and Celesteela can OHKO it in return with Heavy Slam to get a free Defense boost. Ferrothorn tends to run maximum Special Defense investment and therefore is barely even 2HKOed by Hidden Power Fire sets. Mega Scizor is also unfazed by Mega Diancie's attacks, with the exception of the rare Hidden Power Fire, and can OHKO Mega Diancie with priority Bullet Punch.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Both offensive and support variants of Arceus-Ground easily deal with Mega Diancie, as they are able to outspeed it and OHKO it with powerful STAB attacks. Primal Groudon is able to OHKO Mega Diancie with Precipice Blades, but it should be noted that it is 2HKOed by Earth Power. Zygarde-C is able to OHKO Mega Diancie with Thousand Arrows after Stealth Rock damage, but it needs to be in its Complete forme in order to be able to tank a Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre: Primal Kyogre has more than enough bulk to take any of Mega Diancie's hits and OHKO it with Origin Pulse.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Water and Arceus-Fairy</strong>: Arceus-Water and Arceus-Fairy can Recover off damage taken from any of Mega Diancie's attacks and wear it down with Judgment or Ice Beam in Arceus-Water's case.</p> <p><strong>Chansey</strong>: Chansey has enough bulk thanks to its Eviolite to shrug off any attack from Mega Diancie with Soft-Boiled. It should be noted, though, that if it is not running Seismic Toss, it can't do anything back to Mega Diancie.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers and Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster attackers such as Marshadow, Ultra Necrozma, Mega Lucario, Arceus-Ground, and Choice Scarf Xerneas can all outspeed Mega Diancie and KO it with their hard-hitting attacks.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Moonblast is a Fairy-type STAB attack that allows Mega Diancie to hit a significant amount of the tier for neutral damage. It's also useful for hitting Marshadow, Mega Salamence, Zygarde-C, Rayquaza, Mega Sableye, and Tyranitar.</li> <li>Diamond Storm is a useful 100-Base Power STAB move that hits Flying-type Pokemon such as Ho-Oh for super effective damage. It also takes advantage of Mega Diancie's high Attack stat and allows it to easily take care of Pokemon with high Special Defense such as Blissey, Primal Kyogre, and Gothitelle. Another useful perk of Diamond Storm is the fact that it has a 50% chance to boost Mega Diancie's Defense by two stages, allowing it to survive crucial attacks such as a Precipice Blades from an uninvested Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Earth Power is useful for dealing with common Fairy-resistant Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Mega Gengar, Magearna, and Toxapex. It should be noted, though, that there are a large number of Steel-type Pokemon that are unfazed by Earth Power, either due to a secondary typing that lets them take neutral damage from Earth Power or an ability combined with a lot of natural bulk that allows them to take minimal damage from Earth Power.</li> <li>Toxic punishes just about every non-Steel- and Poison-type Pokemon that switches in, wearing them down and making them easier for Diancie and other teammates to KO.</li> <li>Running Stealth Rock on Mega Diancie means that teammates such as Necrozma-DM and Primal Groudon don't have to run it and are then capable of running more offensive sets.</li> <li>Heal Bell allows Mega Diancie to act as an offensive cleric and can be very useful against offensive teams, where Mega Diancie can struggle to put in work and therefore help its teammates by curing them of status and slightly wearing down foes.</li> <li>Endeavor allows Mega Diancie to take advantage of its low HP stat and make offensive threats easier to wear down.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum EVs in Speed let Mega Diancie take advantage of its base 110 Speed tier.</li> <li>24 EVs in Attack guarantee a 2HKO on Blissey, meaning that it's unable to PP stall Mega Diancie with Soft-Boiled.</li> <li>The remainder of the EVs are placed in Special Attack for maximum damage output.</li> <li>A Naive nature is chosen so Mega Diancie is able to take advantage of its Speed stat and potential Defense boosts from Diamond Storm as well as effectively act as a mixed attacker.</li> <li>Diancite is required for Diancie to become Mega Diancie.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Try to Mega Evolve Diancie as soon as possible, as that way you're able to utilize its ability more effectively. Note that Clear Body can occasionally be useful when Sticky Web is on the field or to prevent Intimidate Attack drops from Salamence before it Mega Evolves, but in reality, this is still hard to justify not Mega Evolving, since Mega Diancie has a solid matchup against Sticky Web setters and is able to KO Mega Salamence with Moonblast anyway.</li> <li>While you should avoid letting Mega Diancie take any damage at all, it is best to bring Mega Diancie in against status or utility moves or against attacks that it resists such as Dark- and Flying-type moves.</li> <li>Although Diancie can quite easily gain a +2 Defense boost with Diamond Storm, it is still better to avoid letting it take supereffective physical attacks, as it is rarely able to survive these, even at +2.</li> <li>Mega Diancie is a very matchup-dependent Pokemon, as it can be a potential wincon against stall teams after defensive threats such as support Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Water have been removed from the field; against offensive teams, however, just use Mega Diancie to try to reflect entry hazards and other status moves, wear down foes with attacks, and potentially heal the status conditions of teammates with Heal Bell.</li> <li>Although Diamond Storm provides great benefits, be wary that it only has 8 PP, so avoid using it too liberally. It is especially important to conserve the PP of Diamond Storm when facing stall teams, as Mega Diancie needs Diamond Storm to KO threats such as Blissey and Ho-Oh.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Gothitelle makes a brilliant partner for Mega Diancie, as it can trap the support Arceus formes that threaten Mega Diancie as well as other defensive Pokemon that pose a great threat to Mega Diancie such as Celesteela and Ferrothorn. It is also worth noting that the core of Gothitelle + Mega Diancie beats every relevant Defogger in the tier one-on-one, which makes it easier for Mega Diancie to set up Stealth Rock and keep it on the field for the majority of the game.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM is a brilliant partner for Mega Diancie, as it is able to deal with Xerneas, Arceus-Water, and Arceus-Fairy lacking Will-O-Wisp. In return, Necrozma-DM appreciates Mega Diancie's ability to deal with Ho-Oh and Yveltal, and Mega Diancie's Stealth Rock support lets Necrozma-DM run more offensive sets like Double Dance. Support Necrozma-DM also makes a useful partner for Mega Diancie, as it is a strong Steel-type that shuts down some support Arceus formes such as Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Fairy.</li> <li>Ho-Oh makes a nice partner, as it can threaten the Steel-types that threaten Mega Diancie, and it also appreciates Mega Diancie's ability to prevent entry hazards from being set.</li> <li>Arceus-Ground is a useful partner, as it provides the team with a secondary means of keeping hazards off the field with Defog, as well as threatening many of the Ground- and Steel-type Pokemon that beat Diancie, such as Primal Groudon, Excadrill, Mega Lucario, and Zygarde-C.</li> <li>Giratina-O can take advantage of the status that Mega Diancie can potentially reflect with Magic Bounce and appreciates Diancie's resistance to Dark-type attacks. Furthermore, it can help support Mega Diancie by Defogging away hazards.</li> <li>Primal Groudon is also a nice partner for Mega Diancie, as it is able to check Necrozma-DM more effectively than Arceus-Ground and is also an effective check to Xerneas.</li> <li>Both offensive and defensive variants of Zygarde-C make good partners for Mega Diancie, as they provide the team with a check to Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, Earthquake Mega Salamence, offensive Arceus-Ground sets, Mega Lucario, and Ho-Oh. Offensive variants of Zygarde-C particularly appreciate Diancie's ability to deal with Yveltal.</li> <li>Marshadow makes a nice offensive partner for Mega Diancie, as it provides teams with a means of threatening Necrozma-DM, Ultra Necrozma, and common Ghost-types such as Mega Gengar, as well as providing teams with priority, making it easier to clean off weakened foes thanks to Shadow Sneak. Marshadow also appreciates Mega Diancie dealing with common threats to it such as Yveltal and checking Mega Salamence and Ho-Oh, which are two Pokemon that Marshadow can struggle with depending on whether it runs Hidden Power Ice or Rock Tomb.</li> <li>Arceus-Water makes a good defensive partner for Mega Diancie, as it is able to check a number of Pokemon that Mega Diancie struggles to deal with, such as Arceus-Ground, Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, Mega Salamence, and Primal Kyogre sets lacking Thunder. Arceus-Water sets running Will-O-Wisp also have a decent matchup against Necrozma-DM and Mega Lucario, as it resists their Steel-type attacks and can burn them.</li> <li>Yveltal is a good offensive partner for Mega Diancie, since it threatens Necrozma-DM, Marshadow, and Mega Gengar. It also provides the team with a Ground immunity, which is crucial to have in a metagame dominated by Primal Groudon.</li> </ul> "

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Ribombee's high Speed stat coupled with a Fairy typing makes it a viable choice on very specific teams as a Sticky Web setter, as it's much less passive than its main competition in Smeargle. It can offensively force out Pokemon that are otherwise dangerous to Sticky Web teams, such as Zygarde-C, Yveltal, and Mega Salamence, especially since the latter two avoid Sticky Web's Speed drop and can effectively use Defog to remove it for teammates.</li> <li>Additionally, unlike Smeargle, Magic Bounce users such as Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie are unable to beat Ribombee one-on-one, as a decent Special Attack stat with maximum investment allows it to 2HKO both targets, meaning they fail to anti-lead Ribombee successfully and thus cannot prevent the Sticky Web.</li> <li>However, there are many other Pokemon, such as Mega Gengar and Cloyster, that are able to shutdown Ribombee's Sticky Web attempts through the use of Taunt or Rapid Spin, while offensive threats such as Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM can use it as setup fodder very easily, even being able to increase their Speed through boosting moves to limit the effects of Stun Spore.</li> <li>Ribombee's inability to prevent entry hazards from the opposing team means it allows its teammates to be continually chipped and get their possible Focus Sash broken. This is one of the reasons why Smeargle is opted for much more often, as it can at least prevent opposing hazards with Taunt or even run Rapid Spin.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Toxic is a decent option over Quiver Dance, as it lets Ribombee put Ho-Oh on a timer while still beating support Arceus formes, although offensive variants of Ho-Oh will still get crippled by Stun Spore.</li> <li>Aromatherapy is another viable option, as it lets Ribombee cure its teammates of status ailments, although without Quiver Dance its matchup versus support Arceus formes is much worse.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rapid Spin Users</strong>: Cloyster can OHKO Ribombee through its Focus Sash and utilize Rapid Spin, and it can set up Spikes or Toxic Spikes to cripple Ribombee's team. Excadrill resists Moonblast, sets Stealth Rock, and repeatedly uses Rapid Spin to remove Sticky Web as it goes up, eventually KOing Ribombee. However, Cloyster and Excadrill are annoyed by Stun Spore, and a full paralysis on the wrong turn can let Sticky Web stay up.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar: Mega Gengar takes little damage from Moonblast and OHKOes Ribombee even at +1 Special Defense, easily being able to trap and dispose of it.

However, offensive variants of Necrozma-DM and Mega Scizor dislike taking Stun Spore.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Ho-Oh is a nuisance for Ribombee, as it's able to sponge boosted attacks and Defog away the Sticky Web.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Once set on the opposing side of the field, Sticky Web will lower the Speed of opposing grounded Pokemon like Mega Gengar, Ultra Necrozma, and support Arceus formes. This lets teammates like Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre outspeed them and helps prevent them from getting revenge killed themselves.</li> <li>Moonblast is a strong Fairy-type STAB attack that prevents Ribombee from being passive, letting it threaten Defoggers hit super effectively by it such as Yveltal and Giratina-O, as well as preventing free setup from the likes of Mega Salamence and Zygarde-C.</li> <li>Stun Spore lets Ribombee cripple Steel- and Fire-types as well as faster Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, and Choice Scarf Xerneas. Stun Spore works exceptionally well if the opponent leads with a support Arceus forme or Choice Scarf user, as it allows teammates to more easily pressure them with strong attacks and attempt to prevent their Defog attempts after Ribombee is knocked out.</li> <li>Quiver Dance, when used in tandem with Stun Spore, gives Ribombee a way of pressuring support Arceus formes, as they commonly run Defog. It also lets Ribombee outrun Choice Scarf Xerneas and Yveltal after a boost, 2HKOing the former and having a high chance to OHKO the latter.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum Special Attack investment allows Ribombee to have a high chance to 2HKO Mega Diancie from full, forcing it out and letting it set up Sticky Web, while maximum Speed investment allows it to outpace support Arceus formes and Naganadel.</li> <li>Shield Dust prevents the secondary effects of moves such as Rock Tomb, Sacred Fire, and Fake Out and, in tandem with Focus Sash, helps Ribombee guarantee that Sticky Web goes up at least once.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Although it is technically a dedicated entry hazard lead, it's not always advisable to lead off with Ribombee, as opposing leads such as Mega Gengar, Deoxys-S, Excadrill, and Cloyster can annoy it through the use of Taunt or Rapid Spin. Thus, avoid leading with Ribombee if these threats are on the opposing team.</li> <li>If the aforementioned threats are not present, it's a good idea to lead with Ribombee more often than not, as getting up Sticky Web early on in the match lets you heavily pressure your opponent. After setting up Sticky Web, try to identify the opponent's possible forms of hazard removal and then bring out the respective wallbreaker with a good matchup versus them, such as bringing in Primal Kyogre to prevent Arceus-Ground from Defogging successfully.</li> <li>Stun Spore should be utilized if Ribombee cannot offensively force out the threat in front it, as this allows the target to be taken advantage of by teammates more easily. Additionally, attempt to use Stun Spore first on targets that have the potential to outspeed Ribombee, such as a possible Choice Scarf Xerneas, Yveltal, Ho-Oh, or Necrozma-DM that could attempt to undergo Ultra Burst. This allows you to get the most utility out of Ribombee, as simply going for Sticky Web against them means they will outspeed and KO Ribombee the next turn, although Stun Spore's finicky accuracy can be a problem in these situations.</li> <li>Predict forced switches against the likes of Zygarde-C and Mega Salamence to attempt to utilize Quiver Dance, as it can be a neat tool for pressuring support Arceus formes, especially in conjunction with Stun Spore's paralysis chance, weakening them for teammates in the back. Quiver Dance can also be used on the turn you predict your opponent to sacrifice a Pokemon, as this allows you to outspeed opposing Choice Scarf users and possibly force damage on a slower target.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Mixed Primal Groudon with Eruption enjoys Sticky Web support, as it can then outspeed and heavily weaken a large amount of Defoggers such as Arceus-Ground, Ho-Oh, and Giratina-O that will attempt to remove your entry hazards. This lets Ribombee set up its Sticky Web again later in the match, when the Defoggers have been either KOed or weakened after being smacked around by Primal Groudon. Mixed Primal Groudon may also forgo Swords Dance and instead run Stealth Rock to further cripple the opposing team.</li> <li>Life Orb Yveltal's generally limited defensive counterplay and ability to use Taunt on Defog users makes it ideal on Sticky Web teams, forcing Sticky Web to stay up and preventing opposing hazards from the opponent.</li> <li>Calm Mind + Water Spout Primal Kyogre is in the same boat as Eruption Primal Groudon, taking advantage of the Speed-lowering effect of Sticky Web to drop powerful attacks on Defoggers. Life Orb Palkia with Focus Punch also accomplishes a similar role, 2HKOing support Arceus formes with the right STAB move and threatening out Ho-Oh and Giratina-O. Both Pokemon also adequately ease up the matchup versus stall and semi-stall teams.</li> <li>Ultra Necrozma is a staple on Sticky Web builds, as although it is already very fast, Sticky Web lets it outpace even more offensive threats such as Mega Gengar, Mega Mewtwo Y, Deoxys-A, and Choice Scarf Xerneas, preventing it from being revenge killed. It also enjoys Ribombee's ability to offensively force out Yveltal. Special Ultra Necrozma can also fit Stealth Rock on its moveset, as it can punish hazard removal attempts from Mega Salamence, Giratina-O, and Ho-Oh with super effective coverage.</li> <li>Other common Pokemon that benefit from Sticky Web include Rayquaza, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Swords Dance Arceus-Ground, all of which can break down the opposing team and pressure support Arceus formes with high powered attacks, especially with Ribombee's additional Stun Spore support. Rayquaza and Extreme Killer Arceus both utilize Extreme Speed to help in an offense versus offense matchup. Arceus-Ground can occasionally fit Extreme Speed in its moveset, but more importantly, it also provides another option for a Stealth Rock user.</li> <li>Mega Diancie, although possibly redundant in combination with Ribombee, can set up Stealth Rock to further pressure the opponent while bouncing back opposing hazards with Magic Bounce. It also handles Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Mega Salamence decently well, forcing them out with the threat of Diamond Storm and preventing their possible Defog attempts. Its access to Explosion also helps versus Defog and Rapid Spin users it can't beat, as Explosion blocks the use of both moves successfully.</li> <li>Mega Gengar, Marshadow, and Lunala provide spinblocking support for Ribombee, ensuring its hazards stay up versus Excadrill, Cloyster, and Rapid Spin Smeargle leads. Mega Gengar especially enjoys Ribombee using Stun Spore on Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, and Arceus-Ground, boosting the power of Hex and letting it trap and KO or heavily weaken these targets. Ultra Necrozma can also use Necrozma-DW as its base form before Ultra Burst, providing another option for a spinblocker on the team.</li> </ul> "

  "Toxapex": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Toxapex's typing and solid defensive stats allow it to function as a defensive pivot for balanced and stall-inclined teams and as a check to common threats such as Ho-Oh, Marshadow, and Mega Lucario.</li> <li>Toxapex has a great utility movepool with moves like Haze, Knock Off, and Scald, and it's also one of the few viable Pokemon in the tier with access to Toxic Spikes.</li> <li>Regenerator along with Recover allows Toxapex to pivot into many attacks and stay alive throughout the game fairly easily.</li> <li>However, Toxapex's lackluster offensive stats make it quite passive, which leads it to being trapped by Mega Gengar, a very common Pokemon in the tier.</li> <li>This, combined with the fact that Toxapex has a Ground-type weakness, leaves it vulnerable against common Ground-types such as Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Zygarde.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>A Wacan Berry set with an EV spread investing in Special Defense can act as an emergency check to Geomancy Xerneas but doesn't do much aside from that.</li> <li>Knock Off is a decent option, as it can remove key items from Pokemon like Xerneas, Blissey, and Ho-Oh, but it is generally inferior to Scald and Toxic due to their ability to inflict status conditions.</li> <li>Ice Beam can help Toxapex a bit with checking Rayquaza, Mega Salamence, and Zygarde, but it still rather weak and outclassed by Scald and Toxic.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Shadow Tag</strong>: Both Mega Gengar and Gothitelle can trap Toxapex easily, and only an unhealthy Mega Gengar fears repeated Scalds. Mega Gengar can overcome Toxapex with any set, while Gothitelle can prevent Toxapex from using Recover with Taunt and either PP stall it with Rest or eliminate it with Psyshock. However, Shed Shell Toxapex can freely switch out of these Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Zygarde are all huge threats for Toxapex, though the former two dislike Toxic Spikes and Toxic and the latter fears the rare Ice Beam. Primal Groudon threatens Toxapex with Precipice Blades and nullifies Scald with its Desolate Land. Arceus-Ground can threaten Toxapex with its Judgment and use Defog to keep Toxic Spikes off the field. Zygarde can remove poison with Rest and fire off super effective Thousand Arrows, or worse, set up Dragon Dance. The more uncommon Ground-types Excadrill and Dugtrio threaten Toxapex with their STAB Earthquake. Excadrill can remove Toxic Spikes with Rapid Spin, while Dugtrio can trap and OHKO non-Shed Shell Toxapex.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye: Mega Sableye can bounce back Toxic Spikes with Magic Bounce. It does not necessarily threaten Toxapex, but it can remove Toxapex's item with Knock Off or cripple it defensively with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Mega Salamence</strong>: Dragon Dance + Facade Mega Salamence can switch in on Toxapex's Scald or Toxic to power up Facade. After Mega Salamence gets statused, boosted Facade will tremendously damage Toxapex. Despite this, Mega Salamence has to be wary of variants carrying Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types</strong>: Psychic-types such as Ultra Necrozma, Deoxys-A, Lunala, and Mewtwo can easily OHKO Toxapex with their STAB attacks. Though they all dislike Toxic, and Scald can remove Lunala's Shadow Shield and cripple Mega Mewtwo X, they take little to no damage from Toxapex's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: While uncommon, Electric-types such as Zekrom, Arceus-Electric, and Tapu Koko are all Pokemon that can do massive damage to Toxapex with their STAB Electric-type attacks. However, Zekrom has to be wary of Scald, as it can cripple it.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers: Strong special attackers such as Yveltal and Primal Kyogre carrying Thunder or Earthquake can overwhelm Toxapex, despite its relatively high Special Defense stat. Xerneas can threaten Toxapex with Thunder, though Geomancy variants have to be wary of Haze before setting up.</p> ",

It's highly appreciated by defensive teams due to its ability to weaken offensive teams.</li> <li>Scald is mostly used for burns and to prevent Mega Gengar from constantly switching in to absorb Toxic Spikes.</li> <li>Haze is mainly used for removing boosts from physical sweepers such as Mega Lucario.</li> <li>Recover is necessary to keep Toxapex alive to check Ho-Oh and Marshadow.</li> <li>Toxic is an option over Scald to better deal with Ho-Oh and cripple switch-ins like Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground, but giving up Scald means giving up any offensive presence whatsoever.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum HP and Defense EVs with a Bold nature maximize Toxapex's physical bulk, allowing it to take on most physical attackers in the tier.</li> <li>Rocky Helmet is the best item choice due to the indirect damage it causes to physical attackers like Marshadow, Ho-Oh, and Mega Lucario, which Toxapex is too weak to deal with.</li> <li>Shed Shell is another option that allows Toxapex to escape from trappers like Mega Gengar, Gothitelle, and the uncommon Dugtrio.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Toxapex should be used as a defensive pivot that can switch into physical attackers such as defensive Ho-Oh, Marshadow, and Mega Lucario lacking Earthquake. It can also switch in to absorb Toxic Spikes if needed.</li> <li>Keep in mind that strong physical attacks from the likes of offensive Ho-Oh, Bulk Up Marshadow, and Dragon Dance Mega Salamence can still overwhelm Toxapex.</li> <li>Against offensive teams, only one layer of Toxic Spikes is usually sufficient enough to beat them, but a second layer may be used against defensive teams that want to stay in longer with their Pokemon.</li> <li>Toxapex can set up Toxic Spikes against mainly physical attackers that don't carry super effective coverage such as Marshadow.</li> <li>It can also take advantage of more passive Pokemon such as Arceus-Water, Arceus-Fairy, and specially defensive Necrozma-DM, in order to force them to get rid of Toxic Spikes with Defog or allow Toxapex to use Recover on them to regain health.</li> <li>If carrying Toxic, it's best to use it to cripple checks and counters that may switch in on Toxapex, such as Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground. It's also appropriate to cripple other Pokemon right away if Toxic Spikes can't be set up.</li> <li>If not carrying Toxic, make appropriate double switches when Toxapex's checks and counters arrive, as Toxapex otherwise ends up being fodder to them.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Ho-Oh checks Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground sets not carrying Rock-type coverage and greatly appreciates Toxic Spikes support from Toxapex, as it helps Ho-Oh take down Primal Kyogre and Arceus-Water. It can also offer Defog support.</li> <li>Support Arceus-Ground can take down Primal Groudon and Zygarde and remove entry hazards with Defog.</li> <li>Ferrothorn greatly appreciates Toxapex's ability to check Marshadow and Ho-Oh and forms a hazard stacking core with Toxapex. However, this can stack weaknesses to Mega Gengar and offensive Ho-Oh.</li> <li>In general, Toxapex wants Stealth Rock support from Pokemon like Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Tyranitar to make checking Pokemon like offensive Ho-Oh and Mega Salamence easier. Tyranitar can also remove trappers like Mega Gengar and Gothitelle for Toxapex and check Mega Salamence and Ho-Oh not carrying Earthquake with its STAB Rock-type attacks.</li> <li>Blissey and Chansey appreciate Toxapex's ability to check most Fighting-types and help in checking strong special attackers such as Xerneas and Primal Kyogre in return.</li> <li>Mega Sableye can bounce back hazards to help keep Toxapex as healthy as possible and check Mega Gengar.</li> <li>Both Giratina formes greatly benefit Toxapex. Giratina is a sturdier check to strong physical attackers that can overwhelm Toxapex such as offensive Ho-Oh and Dragon Dance Mega Salamence and can use Dragon Tail to force Pokemon to switch into Toxic Spikes. Giratina-O is a less sturdy check to the aforementioned Pokemon, but it can check most Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground sets and easily take advantage of Toxic Spikes with Hex. Lastly, both Giratina formes provide Defog support.</li> <li>Zygarde is another Pokemon that can check offensive Ho-Oh and Mega Salamence, but it can also take advantage of Toxic Spikes with a Dragon Dance set.</li> </ul> "

  "Solgaleo": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Solgaleo has an unfortunate place in the Ubers metagame, as it boasts a mediocre offensive typing, a rather average movepool, and an ability that's only really useful against Sticky Web teams and the occasional Intimidate.</li> <li>While it has reasonable enough stats and moves to be able to use multiple sets, the presence of Necrozma-DM means that most of those sets are utterly outclassed by it, thus making it hard to justify using Solgaleo in the tier.</li> <li>Solgaleo does, however, boast a greater Speed stat than Necrozma-DM that is decent enough to utilize a Choice Scarf, allowing it to become a reasonable offensive check to Xerneas. This paired with its ability Full Metal Body also allows Solgaleo to retain its Speed against Sticky Webs teams.</li> <li>With a Choice Scarf, Solgaleo is also a decent answer to cores that try to utilize Psychic Terrain such as Tapu Lele with Deoxys-A or Ultra Necrozma, as it resists both of Tapu Lele's STAB moves, is able to outpace both Deoxys-A and Ultra Necrozma, and OHKOes Deoxys-A and 2HKOes Ultra Necrozma with Sunsteel Strike.</li> </ul> ",

Primal Groudon is able to OHKO Solgaleo with any of its STAB moves and has enough natural bulk to survive Earthquakes from Solgaleo. Arceus-Ground is able to dish out heavy damage with STAB moves. Support sets are also able to recover off any damage that Solgaleo dishes out. Zygarde-C is completely unfazed by Solgaleo's attacks, as none of them even break its Substitute, allowing it to easily set up in front of Solgaleo and OHKO it with Thousand Arrows.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Mega Gengar is one of the biggest threats to Solgaleo, as it is able to trap Solgaleo and remove it from the field. However, it is OHKOed by Earthquake and 2HKOed by any of Solgaleo's attacks, so it isn't able to switch in to any of Solgaleo's attacks. Marshadow is able to OHKO Solgaleo with Spectral Thief and 2HKO it with Close Combat or Shadow Sneak. Arceus-Ghost is able to survive any of Solgaleo's attacks and OHKO it with STAB moves, and Giratina-O is able to OHKO it with Shadow Force, cripple it with Will-O-Wisp, or OHKO it with Hex if Solgaleo is statused.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Yveltal survives any hit and OHKOes with Dark Pulse, and Arceus-Dark survives any hit, can recover off any damage, can cripple it with Will-O-Wisp, and dishes out heavy damage to Solgaleo with Judgment.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh: Ho-Oh is completely unfazed by most of Solgaleo's attacks. It does have to be careful to avoid Solgaleo if it is locked into Stone Edge, however.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre</strong>: All l Primal Kyogre sets beat Solgaleo one-on-one, as physical ones 2HKO it with Liquidation and Earthquake, Calm Mind sets have a chance to OHKO Solgaleo after Stealth Rock with Origin Pulse, and defensive sets are able to 2HKO Solgaleo with Scald, potentially burn Solgaleo, and recover off any of the damage that Solgaleo dishes out with Rest.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Although Solgaleo is immune to Toxic, it is heavily crippled by burns, as they remove any offensive presence.

Most notably, Flare Blitz OHKOes Ferrothorn and Mega Lucario and 2HKOes Necrozma-DM and Magearna.</li> <li>Earthquake is Solgaleo's most effective way of dishing out damage to Primal Groudon and Mega Gengar, which is otherwise able to trap Solgaleo and remove it from the field.

It also pairs well with Earthquake.</li> <li>Alternatively, Wild Charge allows Solgaleo to dish out heavy damage to Primal Kyogre while still hitting Ho-Oh for supereffective damage.</li> <li>Toxic hits a lot of neutral targets and is Solgaleo's most reliable means of punishing support Arceus formes, which can otherwise be problematic.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Choice Scarf Solgaleo is best run with a standard offensive EV spread with maximum Attack and Speed.</li> <li>A Jolly nature is used to take advantage of Solgaleo's decent Speed tier, allowing it to outpace Modest Choice Scarf Yveltal and Xerneas.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Solgaleo tends to be used best as a revenge killer and an offensive check to Xerneas. Make sure to keep it healthy until Xerneas has been removed from the field, as it can take up to 90% from a +2 Focus Blast. Therefore, it is best used late-game, as it's only really useful for revenge killing Xerneas and Psychic Terrain cores.</li> <li>If you're facing less offensive teams that aren't using Xerneas, Solgaleo can be used as a decent answer to Arceus-Fairy, Magearna, and Mega Diancie. It can also be used to scout for Toxic.</li> <li>While it's primarily a revenge killer, it's important to consider what moves you lock Solgaleo into, as Solgaleo can end up becoming setup fodder for Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre or utterly walled by foes such as Ho-Oh if it's locked into the wrong move.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Primal Groudon makes a useful partner for Solgaleo, as Solgaleo's presence allows Primal Groudon to run more offensive sets. It also deals with common Pokemon that threaten Solgaleo such as Mega Gengar, and its immunity to burns and Thunder Wave combined with Solgaleo's immunity to poison means that they can both help prevent each other from being crippled by status. Solgaleo also appreciates the offensive pressure that Primal Groudon generates, especially against threatening foes such as support Arceus formes, opposing Primal Groudon, Mega Gengar, and Yveltal.</li> <li>Yveltal is a nice partner for Solgaleo, as it is able to threaten Mega Gengar and Marshadow. It provides the team with a Ground immunity, which Solgaleo greatly appreciates, and in return, it appreciates Solgaleo's ability to threaten Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy, which otherwise wall Yveltal.</li> <li>Both Swords Dance and support Arceus-Ground sets make for brilliant partners for Solgaleo, as they're both able to threaten Primal Groudon and Mega Gengar. Swords Dance sets are also especially useful for threatening Ho-Oh, and support sets are useful to deal with Zygarde-C, which otherwise walls Solgaleo and can use it as setup fodder, cripple it with Glare, or dish out heavy damage with Thousand Arrows. Support sets can also remove entry hazards for Solgaleo, preventing it from potentially being worn down and losing its ability to check Xerneas.</li> <li>Marshadow deals with many of the Pokemon that threaten Solgaleo, such as Mega Gengar and Arceus-Dark. It also provides the team with some priority, allowing it to easily revenge kill.</li> <li>Xerneas is a great partner for Solgaleo, as it threatens the common Dark-type Pokemon that Solgaleo dislikes such as Yveltal and Arceus-Dark. It also appreciates Solgaleo's ability to deal with Magearna.</li> <li>Ho-Oh makes for a useful partner for Solgaleo, as it resists the Fire- and Ground-type attacks that threaten Solgaleo.</li> <li>Mega Salamence and Rayquaza are also useful partners for Solgaleo, since they provide teams with key Fire-type resistances and Ground immunities. Both of them also appreciate Solgaleo's ability to check Xerneas, making it easier for Mega Salamence and Rayquaza to sweep.</li> <li>Primal Kyogre is a nice partner for Solgaleo, as it's able to threaten the Fire- and Ground-type Pokemon that threaten Solgaleo, such as Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Arceus-Ground.</li> </ul> "

  "Lunala": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Lunala is one of the threatening wallbreakers in the tier, capable of breaking down various archetypes with its strong STAB Ghost-type attacks along with a large number of useful coverage moves, Lunalium Z, and Calm Mind in its arsenal, making it a versatile Pokemon both offensively and defensively.</li> <li>Despite having a disappointing defensive typing, Lunala is still capable of functioning well against offense due to how difficult it is to safely switch into without a specific Pokemon like Chople Berry Extreme Killer Arceus. Most importantly, most Pokemon attempting to take down Lunala will have a disadvantageous matchup due to Shadow Shield halving incoming damage when Lunala's health is full. This means that, with Shadow Shield intact, Lunala will always have a chance to pose a threat to any team lacking a Pursuit trapper, being able to revenge kill threatening setup sweepers like Primal Groudon and Zygarde-C while also functioning as a defensive wall on slower teams where a blanket check to many threats that can avoid Shadow Tag trapping is appreciated.</li> <li>Lunala's good performance against offensive teams is further reinforced by its ability to check Ultra Necrozma and viably equip Choice Scarf to prey on such archetypes that typically have unreliable answers to Ghost-types. A few checks from offensive teams can also be bypassed by coverage moves or repeated attacks with entry hazards up.</li> <li>Lunala's effectiveness against offensive teams is largely dependent on the availability of Shadow Shield or its Z-Move, especially the former, as it provides opportunities for Lunala to switch in and attack. While it has enough Speed to threaten foes like Primal Groudon, it is also vulnerable to offensive threats that can OHKO Lunala through Shadow Shield like Yveltal and Marshadow.</li> <li>As much as Shadow Shield contributes to Lunala's viability, a broken Shadow Shield can restrict Lunala's ability to set up or check a threat in an emergency to a large extent. This leads to Lunala being forced to avoid entry hazards and status by any means necessary, at least before it sets up as an offensive variant or trades status or revenge kills a foe as a defensive variant.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Fightinium Z gives Lunala a way to OHKO Yveltal and Arceus-Dark after a Calm Mind boost, but these checks can be overpowered by a boosted Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom and Focus Blast after some prior damage.</li> <li>A Z-Hypnosis set can potentially provide Lunala with a better setup opportunity by putting a check to sleep and, more importantly, makes Lunala harder to revenge kill by letting it outspeed Arceus formes and Mega Gengar. However, Hypnosis is generally unreliable, and Lunala will rely on favorable sleep turns, as it needs multiple Calm Mind boosts to gain enough power to OHKO foes.</li> <li>A Choice Specs set may be an attractive option that can pressure Arceus formes and Ho-Oh harder, but there is little reason to use a Choice Specs set over a Calm Mind set to wallbreak. Choice Specs sets also have to predict accurately to break through defensive teams.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Every Dark-type, with the exception of Mega Sableye, can pivot into Moongeist Beam with ease and threaten to at worst weaken Lunala with their STAB attacks. Arceus-Dark survives +1 Focus Blast from full health and 2HKOes Lunala with Judgment. While Yveltal is a shakier switch-in to Lunala due to its weakness to Ice Beam and vulnerability to Stealth Rock, it can OHKO an unboosted Lunala through Shadow Shield using Dark Pulse. Alolan Muk doesn't have much trouble taking Lunala's attacks and is only concerned about a boosted Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom when it is sufficiently weakened. Tyranitar can remove Choice Scarf Lunala locked into the wrong move and defensive variants with Pursuit after sandstorm damage, which breaks Shadow Shield.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Though Ghost-types struggle to switch into Lunala, foes like Mega Gengar and Marshadow can outspeed and OHKO it. Note that the matchup can be reversed if Lunala holds a Choice Scarf, and Shadow Shield must have been broken for Mega Gengar to revenge kill Lunala with Hex and Marshadow to OHKO Lunala with Shadow Sneak.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards and Status: Lunala is heavily reliant on Shadow Shield to maximize the chance it sets up successfully and retain its ability to retaliate against many setup sweepers. This means residual damage from entry hazards, burn, and poison takes away a large part of Lunala's usefulness.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Thanks to its titanic special bulk and Regenerator, Ho-Oh can effectively pivot into Lunala and revenge kill offensive variants once Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom has been used. Choice Scarf Lunala in particular struggles to break through Ho-Oh without Stealth Rock support, and defensive variants should avoid trading Toxic with Ho-Oh due to Regenerator allowing Ho-Oh to outlast Lunala.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey</strong>: Both Chansey and Blissey are immune to Moongeist Beam and have high enough bulk to not mind even boosted Focus Blasts. However, note that Psyshock gives Lunala a significantly better chance to defeat them, and they are also heavily crippled by a well-timed Trick from Choice Scarf variants.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit</strong>: Alolan Muk and the less-reliable Marshadow and Tyranitar can remove Lunala from play using Pursuit. Note, however, that Alolan Muk is the only Pursuit trapper that can directly switch into Lunala without fear, as Tyranitar relies on Lunala locking itself into a wrong move while holding Choice Scarf or being a defensive variant, and Marshadow has to make a risky prediction.</p> ",

With Calm Mind and Lunalium Z, Lunala can threaten to OHKO most neutral targets with Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom. Note that Moongeist Beam and Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom can bypass abilities like Multiscale.</li> <li>Psyshock is a secondary STAB move that has significantly higher damage output against specially bulky foes like Primal Kyogre and enables Lunala to break past Chansey and Blissey.</li> <li>Focus Blast provides Lunala with perfect offensive coverage along with Moongeist Beam, enabling it to hit Dark-types super effectively as well as deal with Steel-types better without relying on boosted Moongeist Beam or Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom.</li> <li>Moonblast compresses coverage against Dark- and Dragon-types when Lunala is running Psyshock, but it has less damage output against Arceus-Dark than Focus Blast. Moonblast also doesn't take out Zygarde as fast as Ice Beam does.</li> <li>Ice Beam allows Lunala to weaken Yveltal on the switch and, more importantly, offensively check Dragon-types like Zygarde, Mega Salamence, and Rayquaza without using its Z-Move. Ice Beam generally has better coverage against offensive teams, but many Pokemon that are taken out by Ice Beam are already vulnerable to Moongeist Beam.</li> <li>Roost can be considered for Lunala to fully take advantage of support Arceus formes lacking status and pose a greater threat to slower teams, but it is hard to justify over other attacks.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>12 Special Defense EVs allow Lunala to survive mixed Rock Polish Primal Groudon's Fire Blast after Stealth Rock damage. The rest of the EVs are invested in Special Attack and Speed to make Lunala hit as hard as possible and outspeed as many foes as possible.</li> <li>Though a Modest nature gives Lunala extra power and significantly improves the chance to OHKO Arceus-Dark with +1 Focus Blast after Stealth Rock damage, a Timid nature mostly outweighs this due to it enabling Lunala to outspeed base 90 Speed Pokemon like Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Lunalium Z enables the use of Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom with Moongeist Beam. The sheer power of the Z-Move is one of the most important aspects of this set, as when boosted it becomes so powerful that very few neutral targets can escape the OHKO and even resisted targets like Yveltal can be overpowered with Stealth Rock up.</li> <li>Though it is a much less effective option, if a Z-Move user already exists on the team, Spooky Plate can be considered to improve Moongeist Beam's damage output, guaranteeing a 2HKO on offensive Primal Groudon and, after Stealth Rock, an OHKO on Giratina-O. Spooky Plate-boosted Moongeist Beam also becomes powerful enough to force recovery moves from support Arceus formes.</li> <li>Shadow Shield halves the incoming damage when Lunala's HP is full, making it significantly harder to take down. Note that unlike Multiscale, moves like Sunsteel Strike and Moongeist Beam and users of abilities like Mold Breaker, Teravolt, and Turboblaze cannot ignore Shadow Shield.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>It is generally recommended for Lunala to wallbreak early-game to weaken defensive cores. Weakening foes like support Arceus formes early is going to be beneficial for teammates that will attempt to clean up late-game, but making aggressive plays early on also reduces the odds that Lunala will have to enter the field when entry hazards are up and lose its Shadow Shield.</li> <li>Though Lunala might lack the firepower to immediately threaten bulkier foes, it is capable of 2HKOing most Pokemon found on offensive teams with the appropriate moves. Lunala can also threaten many neutral targets with an unboosted Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom. Avoid solely focusing on setting up Calm Mind and ensure that Lunala nets as much damage as possible before going down.</li> <li>This can pressure opponents into excessively focusing on breaking Lunala's Shadow Shield. As Lunala is quite hard to take on for most offensive Pokemon in a one-on-one situation due to its offensive coverage and ability to score a potential OHKO with Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom, Lunala is difficult to take down even after Stealth Rock damage, so the opponent will likely prioritize setting up Stealth Rock. This means Lunala can switch into possible Stealth Rock users like Primal Groudon and Lunala's teammates can potentially take advantage of the turn the opponent uses to set entry hazards. Leading against suicide leads can also be a good idea, as Lunala will often force opponents to choose between breaking Lunala's Shadow Shield or setting entry hazards that they may need for other Pokemon.</li> <li>Avoid setting up recklessly without fully scouting a foe's moveset. Though it is extremely rare for Lunala's common setup targets to have Dark- and Ghost-type coverage moves, there are other factors to be wary about. Support Arceus formes may have Thunder Wave, which makes Lunala vulnerable to slower foes that it can otherwise overpower without worrying about retaliation. Though Lunala can threaten most Primal Groudon variants, note that Primal Groudon with Rock Tomb can remove Lunala's Speed advantage and break Shadow Shield at the same time and throw a heavy blow before going down, weakening Lunala to the point where it can be picked off by weaker attacks like Arceus formes' Judgment or other slower foes that can outspeed Lunala after Rock Tomb.</li> <li>Lunala with Shadow Shield intact can survive a hit from setup sweepers like Rock Polish Primal Groudon and Mega Salamence and retaliate. With Lunalium Z available, it can OHKO most of the setup sweepers that it aims to hold back.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Fairy-type teammates are recommended, as Lunala needs protection against Dark-types in situations where it is forced out against them. Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy are primary options to consider due to their ability to switch into Dark-types like Yveltal and Arceus-Dark as well as Marshadow, which is one of the most threatening offensive checks to Lunala. Choice Scarf variants of Xerneas can take on faster foes that Lunala cannot effectively combat, while Arceus-Fairy can viably run Stealth Rock to pressure offensive Ho-Oh and allow Lunala's +1 Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom to meet various benchmarks.</li> <li>Magearna is another Fairy-type that checks Yveltal and can bring Lunala safely into the field using Volt Switch.</li> <li>Lunala desires entry hazards to OHKO foes like Ho-Oh after Calm Mind boosts. Offensive teams can use various leads, including Cloyster, which can provide Rapid Spin support, and Smeargle, which can set up Sticky Web and remove Arceus formes' Speed advantage against Lunala. Various Stealth Rock users like Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground that can threaten a good portion of the tier can be employed to keep offensive pressure, giving Lunala more room to prey on teams that defensively react to its teammates.</li> <li>There are also instances where keeping Lunala's Shadow Shield intact should be prioritized over setting entry hazards for its breakthrough. Defog users like Mega Salamence and Arceus-Ground can make managing entry hazards more flexible.</li> <li>Priority move users like Rayquaza and Extreme Killer Arceus can improve Lunala's matchup against faster offensive foes and provide its team with extra security against faster foes when Lunala focuses on wallbreaking instead of preserving its Shadow Shield. Yveltal's ability to threaten Mega Gengar and Ultra Necrozma with Sucker Punch, in addition to its resistance to Dark and Ghost, makes it a noteworthy offensive partner as well.</li> <li>Offensive partners like Necrozma-DM and Mega Salamence can benefit from Lunala's ability to massively pressure Steel-types and other problematic foes like Primal Groudon. Mega Salamence's Defog support and ability to pivot into Ho-Oh can be handy for Lunala.</li> </ul> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Moongeist Beam is capable of doing enough damage to revenge kill slower threats and pressuring many neutral targets.</li> <li>Focus Blast provides Lunala with a coverage move to hit Dark- and Normal-types.</li> <li>With Choice Scarf, Lunala can effectively revenge kill many threats like Zygarde, Mega Salamence, and a weakened Swords Dance Arceus-Ground with Ice Beam.</li> <li>Psyshock prevents Lunala from being completely walled by Blissey and 2HKOes Toxapex and offensive Primal Kyogre after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Trick can be used to permanently cripple a persistent switch-in like defensive Ho-Oh and Chansey and is helpful in matchups against defensive teams where Lunala's Speed advantage over other Pokemon isn't needed.</li> <li>Thunder can be considered due to its higher damage output against Yveltal, Ho-Oh, Primal Kyogre, Arceus-Water, and Celesteela, though it is not the best move to be locked into and is unreliable due to its inaccuracy.</li> <li>Defog can remove entry hazards in a pinch, and Lunala's ability to force switches can make this handy utility on offensive teams, but it is hard to fit.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment is the most ideal EV spread for Lunala holding Choice Scarf so damage output is maximized and Lunala outspeeds as many foes as possible.</li> <li>A Modest nature is typically preferred due to it improving the odds for Lunala to 2HKO support Arceus formes with Stealth Rock support, although a Timid nature is also possible to let Lunala fully take advantage of Choice Scarf. This also enables Lunala to outspeed Modest Choice Scarf Xerneas and Yveltal.</li> <li>Choice Scarf increases Lunala's Speed, significantly improving Lunala's performance against offense when combined with its impressive coverage options.</li> <li>Shadow Shield further amplifies Lunala's effectiveness as a revenge killer by allowing Lunala to survive many strong hits with the ability intact.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Lunala performs significantly better as a revenge killer with Choice Scarf, as it will not be overly reliant on the availability of Shadow Shield and will outspeed primary targets like Ultra Necrozma, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Zygarde at +1. As long as Shadow Shield is intact, Marshadow can be revenge killed as well.</li> <li>Opposing setup sweepers might be caught off guard with a false sense of security that Lunala lacking Shadow Shield will not survive their attack. This can lead an opponent to meaninglessly let one of their Pokemon go down if they don't expect Lunala to be holding a Choice Scarf. This can be seen against threats like boosted Ultra Necrozma and Rayquaza, which can OHKO Lunala lacking Shadow Shield but are vulnerable to Choice Scarf Lunala, which attacks first.</li> <li>Though preserving Shadow Shield can be useful, Choice Scarf Lunala isn't overly reliant on it. It will focus on revenge killing a foe, so it will switch into a threat that it outspeeds even if entry hazards are present on the field. The speed advantage Lunala gains from Choice Scarf further diminishes the necessity to preserve Shadow Shield, so be aggressive with this set. Switch Lunala into powerful foes like Ultra Necrozma that struggle to OHKO Lunala and slower foes like Extreme Killer Arceus should they be in range of Lunala's attacks.</li> <li>Note that Lunala will have some difficulties facing defensive teams with Choice Scarf due to its inability to switch moves. This means Pokemon like Ho-Oh, Arceus-Dark, and Blissey can switch into Lunala to scout what move it will lock itself into and proceed to switch out to a different Pokemon, forcing Lunala's team to make aggressive double switches to retain momentum. Though Trick can cripple a defensive Pokemon, the move has only a single chance to cripple a switch-in, cannot cripple support Arceus formes, and will remove Lunala's speed advantage against them.</li> <li>Pursuit users also become problematic for Choice Scarf Lunala due to it not being able to switch moves. While Alolan Muk poses a problem to all sets, Tyranitar can be harder to deal with due to it forcing Lunala to lock itself into Focus Blast to avoid getting trapped and removed by Pursuit after sandstorm damage breaks Shadow Shield on the switch. Should there be any foe that can harshly punish Lunala locked into Moongeist Beam, consider making double switches and aiming to wear down potential switch-ins until they are removed or weakened enough to be unreliable.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Choice Scarf Lunala is an effective anti-offense Pokemon that can pressure offensive teams by exploiting their general lack of reliable switch-ins to Ghost-types. Thus, it fits in well with balanced cores that can provide entry hazard support to punish switch-ins and check a good number of Pokemon that can exploit Lunala locked into a wrong move.</li> <li>More offensive Stealth Rock users like Stealth Rock + Swords Dance Primal Groudon can be considered to pressure bulkier foes early-game. Pressuring teams early-game increases the chances that Lunala can potentially clean up weakened foes after its checks have been removed or sufficiently weakened.</li> <li>Various slower foes like Ferrothorn and Toxapex can pivot into support Arceus formes and set Spikes and Toxic Spikes to punish grounded foes harder than Stealth Rock would. Toxapex can also check Marshadow. In return, Lunala can take out faster foes like Mega Gengar and Mega Mewtwo Y that have the ability to remove these Pokemon. Wallbreakers like Primal Kyogre that struggle against faster foes due to their middling Speed can also benefit from this set as well while pressuring bulkier teams in return.</li> <li>Pivots to Dark-types like Xerneas and Magearna are needed. Xerneas has more room to customize its moveset, as Lunala performs the role of a revenge killer holding Choice Scarf, meaning it can run Geomancy to clean up weakened teams, which Lunala may struggle to do because of its lower damage output. Magearna is a reliable answer to many Dark-types that may get out of hand if they are not immediately dealt with after Lunala locks itself into Moongeist Beam against them.</li> </ul> "

While Lunala's matchup against bulky entry hazard setters isn't favorable, its conventional teammates like Ho-Oh and Giratina can limit their usefulness, while Lunala can deal with dedicated leads like Deoxys-S better.</li> <li>Toxic prevents Ho-Oh and support Arceus formes from effortlessly walling this set for free while allowing Lunala to potentially stall foes that cannot 2HKO it by continually reactivating its Shadow Shield with Roost.</li> <li>Will-O-Wisp can be used instead to cripple Pursuit trappers and make Lunala a more reliable check to physically-oriented Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>Ice Beam allows Lunala to offensively check Zygarde, but it has little reason to be used over other moves.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>200 Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Lunala to outspeed base 90 Speed Pokemon, enabling it to move faster than foes it can blanket check like Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre.</li> <li>The rest of the EVs allow Lunala to survive Necrozma-DM's +2 Searing Sunraze Smash and Modest Primal Kyogre's +1 Water Spout with Shadow Shield intact.</li> <li>Leftovers provides Lunala with passive recovery.</li> <li>Shadow Shield allows Lunala to function as a wall despite its lack of useful resistances, as it has good natural bulk and can survive many boosted hits with Shadow Shield halving incoming damage when Lunala's HP is full.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>The bulkier version of Lunala is usually employed in defensive teams that desire a blanket check to dangerous Pokemon like Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and physical Primal Kyogre. While it can take them on better with investment in bulk, it will be reliant on prior damage or Toxic stalling to keep them in control due to the lack of offensive investment and Lunalium Z.</li> <li>Despite the reduced offensive presence, switching into this set can actually be harder as Toxic serves as one of the ways to punish bulky foes like support Arceus formes. Offensive entry hazard setters like Swords Dance + Stealth Rock Primal Groudon will also struggle to combat Lunala unless its Shadow Shield is already broken, as many of them are slower than Lunala and have to remain healthy to survive Lunala's attacks.</li> <li>Defensive teams that this Lunala set finds itself on will typically rely on residual damage to wear foes down, using entry hazards or status. Many Steel-types can easily switch into Toxic from Lunala and its teammates, and Xerneas has access to Aromatherapy. This may make it quite difficult to wear down foes by solely relying on status.</li> <li>For this reason, Lunala's team may need countermeasures against passive foes, such as Ho-Oh, and assistance from entry hazards. Note that entry hazards won't be the most reliable solution to outlast the opposing team, as setting them will cause Lunala's teammates to often run into situations where they will have to decide between trading entry hazards to wear down opposing teams faster or entirely avoiding entry hazards until a threat that requires a healthy Lunala to be kept in control goes down.</li> <li>There is also a risk that Lunala will be hit by Toxic after it directly switches into opposing Pokemon or removes entry hazards with Defog. Trading Toxic with entry hazard setters like Primal Groudon can be an acceptable strategy if Lunala's team has strong cleric support, but it is better to avoid status in general. Spending multiple turns to cure Lunala of status and ensuring Lunala stays at full health without being statused to check threats will end up taking away momentum.</li> <li>Against offensive teams, leading with Lunala is generally a sensible idea, as dedicated leads like Cloyster and Excadrill will have to choose between setting entry hazards, which Lunala can easily remove with Defog, or breaking Lunala's Shadow Shield before they get 2HKOed by Moongeist Beam. Though leading with Mega Sableye can invalidate other leads like Smeargle, Deoxys-S and Excadrill can bypass Magic Bounce with Skill Swap and Mold Breaker, respectively, and Cloyster can overpower Mega Sableye with correct predictions. Thus, Lunala is a better option of entry hazard control against them.</li> <li>Pursuit trappers are problematic to this set as well, as this variant of Lunala struggles to punish Dark-types apart from poisoning them with Toxic. Alolan Muk can limit Lunala's effectiveness, Tyranitar can easily dispose of Lunala lacking Will-O-Wisp, and Marshadow carrying Pursuit can potentially eliminate Lunala. Make sure to exercise caution against these threats.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Defensive Lunala's effectiveness depends on the availability of Shadow Shield under offensive pressure, so entry hazard removal is very important. Ho-Oh, Mega Sableye, and Lunala together can deal with most entry hazard setters in the tier. Mega Sableye can discourage the use of Toxic and shut down passive foes like Ferrothorn, Ho-Oh can handle certain Primal Groudon variants with Stealth Rock, and Lunala can effectively use Defog even under offensive pressure.</li> <li>Lunala will mostly be reliant on Magearna when Dark-types switch in and proceed to threaten it. Magearna's access to Heal Bell is also helpful for Lunala, as a number of foes that Lunala takes on are likely going to have Toxic.</li> <li>Blissey is another viable cleric that can fit with Lunala. It can pivot into many support Arceus formes that attempt to status Lunala and check many special attackers that Lunala cannot actively take on while preserving its Shadow Shield.</li> <li>Arceus-Dark is an acceptable check to Yveltal and Ghost-types, and it can viably run Stealth Rock to apply pressure to the opposing team. Variants with Ice Beam can check foes like Ultra Necrozma and Zygarde, which Lunala will have a shakier matchup against should it lack Shadow Shield. Arceus-Fairy is a considerable alternative that can fulfill the same role apart from handling Ghost-types, instead checking Marshadow and posing a greater threat to Yveltal, but note that it can be a hindrance for Lunala's team, which typically employs Pokemon that are not vulnerable to Shadow Tag trapping.</li> <li>Bulkier walls like Zygarde and Lugia can be considered to handle Swords Dance Arceus formes and offensive Primal Groudon variants. Note that Zygarde counters Ho-Oh and makes faster foes more manageable with Glare.</li> <li>Lunala will be reliant on the target being frail or weakened enough to fall to Moongeist Beam when attempting to revenge kill a foe. Pokemon like Necrozma-DM and Primal Kyogre that can offensively check setup sweepers like Xerneas and Primal Groudon can be considered to have extra layers of security against them while reducing the team's overall passivity.</li> </ul> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Running Shed Shell over Leftovers allows Buzzwole to switch out of both Gothitelle and Mega Gengar, which can beat even Earthquake variants of Buzzwole with the combination of Will-O-Wisp and Hex. However, Buzzwole greatly appreciates the residual healing of Leftovers to soften blows from Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Ground, as well as minimizing chip damage from entry hazards, status, and weaker physical attacks.</li> <li>Ice Punch allows Buzzwole to better check offensive variants of Zygarde-C, easily breaking Zygarde-C's Substitute after it activates Power Construct, which Hammer Arm fails to do. Ice Punch can also limit the ability of Flying-types to switch into Buzzwole, having a 50% chance to OHKO uninvested Salamence after Stealth Rock prior to Mega Evolution.</li> <li>Using Drain Punch over Hammer Arm offers a 100% accurate STAB move, and the healing helps Buzzwole wall many threats it checks. However, the lower damage output against Mega Lucario, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Ferrothorn and the difficulty breaking Substitute make it unappealing.</li> <li>Lunge allows Buzzwole to deal with Gothitelle and prevent non-Substitute Bulk Up Marshadow to obtain enough boosts for Buzzwole to KO it.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Flying-types such as Yveltal, Mega Salamence, Ho-Oh, Rayquaza, and Arceus-Flying can all exploit Buzzwole's 4x Flying weakness with their powerful STAB attacks.

Additionally, they either resist Hammer Arm or are immune to Toxic, and Xerneas can also carry Aromatherapy to heal off Toxic poison.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Ghost-types are immune to Hammer Arm and are only damaged by Toxic with the exception of Mega Sableye, which is unaffected by anything Buzzwole can do to it and can proceed to inflict status. Giratina can use Rest to cure Toxic poison. Specially offensive Ghost-types such as Lunala, Necrozma-DW, and Hex Giratina-O can easily break through Buzzwole's low Special Defense. Physically offensive Ghost-types such as Marshadow and Arceus-Ghost must rely on boosting moves but take no damage from anything Buzzwole carries if they opt to run Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Psychic-types: Ultra Necrozma, Deoxys-A, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Tapu Lele all resist Hammer Arm and can KO Buzzwole with their super effective Psychic-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Poison-types easily wall Buzzwole, as they resist Hammer Arm and are unaffected by Toxic. Toxapex can set Toxic Spikes and burn Buzzwole with Scald, while Naganadel can threaten to set up Nasty Plot or outright KO Buzzwole.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre: Primal Kyogre can easily break through Buzzwole's low Special Defense with powerful special attacks.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Primal Groudon nearly always carries super-effective Fire-type STAB moves that can OHKO Buzzwole and can easily take Hammer Arm, though it dislikes Toxic. Variants with only Ground- and Rock-type attacks can be walled but must be scouted first.</p> <p><strong>Shadow Tag</strong>: Depending on Buzzwole's last move, either Mega Gengar or Gothitelle can trap Buzzwole, as they care little for Toxic and Hammer Arm. However, Mega Gengar is KOed by Earthquake if Buzzwole is not burned, and Gothitelle can be outsped and afflicted with Taunt. Buzzwole can also run Shed Shell to escape both trappers at the cost of losing Leftovers recovery.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Toxic poison hinders Buzzwole's ability to consistently wall and stall out threats, while burns lower Hammer Arm's damage, leaving it unable to break Substitute or check threats like Extreme Killer Arceus and Mega Lucario.</p> ",

Its disappointing STAB combination means that the very common Xerneas and Ghost-types limit Pheromosa's effectiveness by discouraging it from using its stronger attacks.</li> <li>Even accounting for its ability to avoid unfavorable matchups with U-turn and circumvent some of its checks with certain coverage moves, Pheromosa is a rather underwhelming Pokemon when it is considered as a fast, frail attacker to trouble offensive teams. Deoxys-A has far better offensive capabilities, being able to threaten and even outright OHKO more foes with its more powerful STAB options and overcoming its inability to pivot with its much narrower defensive counterplay.</li> <li>Other offensive Pokemon like Marshadow and Choice Scarf users like Xerneas and Yveltal prove to be far better anti-offense staples than Pheromosa; Marshadow is much more difficult to switch into, picks off weakened foes with Shadow Sneak, and checks certain setup users with Spectral Thief, while the aforementioned Choice Scarf users are better at generating predictable reactions from an opponent and also possess utility options that will retain their usefulness when their offensive presence is limited.</li> <li>Pheromosa's strength fails to outshine its crippling drawbacks due to the competition it faces with the mentioned offensive Pokemon. The likelihood it will secure its place in teams is further limited by its abysmal bulk, which will make it impossible to make a safe switch into any foes without taking heavy damage or getting KOed. This frailty also causes Pheromosa to fall victim to most priority moves and prevents it from utilizing marginally useful utility moves like Rapid Spin and Taunt and rarely distributed moves like Quiver Dance.</li> <li>Pheromosa already has a considerable amount of risk when against offensive teams where it holds a miniscule, outclassed niche, and it additionally struggles against defensive teams due to foes like Ho-Oh, Toxapex, and Mega Sableye.</li> <li>Despite its offensive stats and movepool that give it a decent matchup against offensive teams, offensively threaten many Dark-types, and threaten teams with loose checks to Fighting-types, Pheromosa generally struggles to justify its place on most teams due to its reliance on prediction and general opportunity cost from its use.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Rapid Spin may give Pheromosa an option to remove entry hazards on forced switches, but Ghost-types' general tendencies to switch into Pheromosa makes this a rather disappointing option. Pheromosa's frailty also means that it will often risk getting KOed when attempting to use Rapid Spin, as the move puts it in a very vulnerable state.</li> <li>High Jump Kick has a high damage output on all non-immune targets and has enough power to possibly 2HKO defensive Primal Groudon and offensive Ho-Oh. High Jump Kick can also be used with Fightinium Z to give Pheromosa access to All-Out Pummeling, which can be used to outright OHKO foes like Primal Kyogre. However, opting for High Jump Kick over Low Kick will make Pheromosa more unreliable and punished harder for mispredictions.</li> <li>Double Kick can be used to anti-lead and pick surprise KOs on Smeargle and Excadrill, but it cannot KO Cloyster and essentially has no other use.</li> <li>Taunt may seem like a useful option to enable Pheromosa to prevent utility moves against slower foes, but it is hard to fit and Pheromosa's frailty makes this even harder to utilize.</li> <li>A set of Quiver Dance / Focus Blast / Ice Beam / Bug Buzz with Fightinium Z can surprise some of Pheromosa's checks, but this set lacks initial power and still struggles against Fairy-types.</li> <li>Focus Sash can turn Pheromosa into a revenge killer, but the loss of power from lack of Life Orb is not worth it.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Ho-Oh resists multiple attacks from Pheromosa and can threaten to KO back with one of its STAB moves. Defensive variants can switch into Pheromosa even when Stealth Rock is up and avoid the 2HKO with Leftovers recovery. Without Stealth Rock, Ho-Oh can consistently prevent Pheromosa from netting much damage thanks to Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types</strong>: Though there are a small number of them that can avoid the 2HKO from Pheromosa, Ghost-types prevent it from freely using its strongest attack and force it to commit to coverage moves, which they can take advantage of by either switching into other Pokemon to take a weaker attack or forcing it to pivot out with a resisted U-turn. This means unreliable yet troublesome Ghost-types like Giratina-O can switch in to hinder Pheromosa if desperately needed. Marshadow, Lunala, and Arceus-Ghost avoid getting 2HKOed by any Pheromosa lacking Throat Chop and force it out.</p> <p><strong>Toxapex: Toxapex is one of the most persistent switch-ins to Pheromosa due to its resistance to most of its attacks, only fearing Drill Run. Regenerator makes it impossible for Pheromosa to wear down Toxapex with U-turn, and variants with Rocky Helmet will put it in a position where it will have to hesitate about pivoting.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy can pivot into Pheromosa thanks to their resistance to its STAB moves. However, they do not like switching into U-turn and are 2HKOed by Poison Jab.</p> <p><strong>Skarmory and Celesteela: Pheromosa can only 2HKO Skarmory by hitting it with Ice Beam on the switch when Stealth Rock is up, and Celesteela narrowly avoids the 2HKO from Low Kick with Protect and Leftovers recovery.</p> <p><strong>Priority Moves</strong>: Pheromosa's frailty leaves it very vulnerable to priority moves from most foes. Marshadow picks off Pheromosa with Life Orb-boosted Shadow Sneak after a single round of recoil damage from Life Orb, and Extreme Killer Arceus outright OHKOes it with Extreme Speed. Life Orb Yveltal, Rayquaza, and Mega Lucario can easily KO Pheromosa with their priority moves after it has been worn down with a few rounds of Life Orb recoil damage.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Choice Scarf users like Xerneas and Yveltal can outspeed and easily OHKO Pheromosa if given a safe switch.</p> ",

        "name": "Offensive Pivot",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Despite its poor coverage, U-turn is Pheromosa's most important move, allowing it to pivot out against its numerous checks and do considerable damage to its switch-ins. It's also Pheromosa's best way to hit Psychic-types like Ultra Necrozma and Mega Mewtwo Y while serving as a safer move to use against Dark-types when various foes are going to predict Low Kick and switch out.</li> <li>Low Kick is the safest and the most consistent Fighting-type STAB move for Pheromosa, as it threatens various Dark- and Steel-types while doing enough damage to 2HKO support Arceus formes and offensive Primal Groudon. Low Kick also has enough power to enable Pheromosa to revenge kill foes like Primal Kyogre and Mild Yveltal after little prior damage.</li> <li>Ice Beam hits many Pokemon that can pivot into U-turn and Low Kick hard, OHKOing Zygarde, Mega Salamence, and Rayquaza and 2HKOing Giratina-O. After a U-turn, Arceus-Flying is 2HKOed as well.</li> <li>The fourth moveslot is the best used to improve Pheromosa's matchup against its typical checks. Throat Chop OHKOes Mega Gengar, takes out Lunala after its Shadow Shield has been broken, and 2HKOes Marshadow and Arceus-Ghost.</li> <li>Poison Jab enables Pheromosa to 2HKO Xerneas and, most of the time, Arceus-Fairy. If lacking defensive investment, a Xerneas hit by Poison Jab after Stealth Rock damage will be left at low enough health to be taken out by U-turn the next time it switches into Pheromosa.</li> <li>Drill Run OHKOes Mega Gengar, 2HKOes Toxapex after Stealth Rock damage, and serves as the hardest way to hit Magearna, guaranteeing 2HKO on it unlike Low Kick.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum Attack investment with Life Orb gives Pheromosa enough power to 2HKO support Arceus formes with Low Kick and OHKO Mega Gengar and Ultra Necrozma with the appropriate moves.</li> <li>Speed EVs are maximized for Pheromosa to take advantage of its stellar Speed tier, enabling it to outspeed almost the entire tier, including some fast foes like Mega Gengar, Ultra Necrozma, and Deoxys-A lacking Extreme Speed. A Naive nature enables Pheromosa to outspeed Mega Mewtwo Y and +1 Zygarde. Beast Boost boosting Speed after every KO almost never proves to be useful, however.</li> <li>A Naughty nature can be used to give Pheromosa enough power to 2HKO the majority of support Arceus formes and have a better chance to 2HKO Primal Groudon without relying on entry hazards.</li> <li>Life Orb improves Pheromosa's damage output to achieve the aforementioned KOs with physical attacks and OHKO any regular Zygarde variant and 2HKO Giratina-O with Ice Beam.</li> <li>If you're using a Naughty nature, Beast Boost boosts Pheromosa's Attack upon KOing a foe, which can see a situational use when cleaning up late-game after its checks have been dealt with.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Pheromosa will have very limited opportunities to safely enter the field. As it cannot switch into any attacks or status moves, it is ideal to bring in Pheromosa as a lead, after a teammate has been KOed, or with an aggressive double switch.</li> <li>With the amount of difficulty involved with giving Pheromosa a chance to attack, it is crucially important to appropriately predict with it. Most of its switch-ins are reliant on their typing to take on Pheromosa, so be quick to identify foes that will potentially pivot into it. As there are multitude of Pokemon that can safely pivot into Pheromosa, U-turn is a weak yet safe option to identify what foe tends to switch into its attacks. U-turn is also a safe option when Pheromosa did not predict correctly against a slower incoming foe and has to retreat afterwards.</li> <li>While Pheromosa can revenge kill threats like Ultra Necrozma, unboosted Mega Salamence, and Mega Mewtwo Y with ease, there are specific matchups where Pheromosa cannot recklessly take on threats it can strike first. The most notable example of this is Zygarde-C with possible way of boosting and Substitute. Pheromosa can avoid getting OHKOed from +1 Thousand Arrows from full health, but if Zygarde-C has Dragon Tail, it will simply OHKO Pheromosa after blocking Ice Beam with Substitute. This means Pheromosa should refrain from recklessly attempting to revenge kill Zygarde-C behind a Substitute without much information about its moveset.</li> <li>Pheromosa's teammates typically benefit from its ability to pressure slower, bulky foes and wear down other foes with U-turn. Entry hazards can punish switch-ins like Xerneas harder should they attempt to pivot into Pheromosa. Stealth Rock is especially useful to prevent Ho-Oh from consistently switching into Pheromosa without any concern and help generate opportunities to 2HKO defensive Primal Groudon and Lugia.</li> <li>Teams lacking durable Ghost-types will struggle to properly handle Pheromosa and will typically send in foes that can take Low Kick. This will give Pheromosa more opportunities to deal more damage on foes instead of being forced to pivot often with U-turn. Teams that rely on Pokemon like Mega Salamence and Giratina-O, which are vulnerable to Ice Beam, struggle to properly keep Pheromosa in check. In these matchups, fully take advantage of Pheromosa's offensive capabilities and prioritize netting as much damage as possible.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Pheromosa's efficiency as an attacker largely depends on availability of entry hazards. Very common yet needed Stealth Rock users like Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM can provide Stealth Rock support while checking Fairy-types. Primal Groudon benefits from Pheromosa's ability to threaten its Dragon-type checks like Zygarde-C, Mega Salamence, and Giratina-O. Offensive sets can take advantage of Pheromosa's U-turn to switch in unharmed, which is helpful when it desires to preserve its health to keep Xerneas in line or set up without taking too much damage. Necrozma-DM running Stealth Rock may struggle against other Steel-types, which Pheromosa can offensively threaten with Low Kick. Offensive teams can use a more dedicated entry hazard lead like Cloyster or Deoxys-S, which enables Pheromosa to pressure opposing teams from early-game through racking up considerable damage by forcing switches.</li> <li>With the exception of Ho-Oh, most switch-ins to Pheromosa like Xerneas, Arceus-Fairy, and Toxapex are vulnerable to Mega Gengar. Most balanced and defensive teams will have a switch-in, if not more, that can persistently switch into Pheromosa, and Mega Gengar can force a trade with a problematic foe to ease Pheromosa's attempts to dish out damage. Pheromosa has the ability to 2HKO Pokemon like Primal Groudon and Arceus-Dark and threaten to heavily impair specially bulky foes like Primal Kyogre, all of which Mega Gengar alone cannot take down.</li> <li>Xerneas is another offensive partner that should be strongly considered. The ability to check Yveltal and Marshadow is greatly appreciated, and Geomancy variants can take advantage of defensive cores worn down by Pheromosa's attacks. Other minor benefits like cleric and Defog support are notable as well, as any status ailments are detrimental to Pheromosa, and removing entry hazards will prevent it from getting worn down too quickly with Life Orb recoil.</li> <li>While Pheromosa can pressure many faster threats, certain sweepers like Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Xerneas can simply set up on Pheromosa in a one-on-one situation. This means Pheromosa alone isn't reliable enough to keep offensive threats from getting out of hand. Priority move users like Yveltal, Marshadow, and Extreme Killer Arceus can provide more security against the aforementioned threats, as the damage Pheromosa will do to them will be sufficient to put them in range of many priority moves when combined with entry hazards or other prior damage. Yveltal and Marshadow also prove to be useful offensive partners with their ability to threaten Ghost-types.</li> <li>Various defensive partners are needed for instances where Pheromosa fails to predict correctly. Various support Arceus formes, Giratina-O, and Mega Salamence will handle Primal Groudon, while Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Magearna can take advantage of Fairy-types that switch into Pheromosa by setting entry hazards or generating momentum, respectively.</li> </ul> "

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Celesteela boasts solid bulk and a brilliant defensive typing, meaning that it can act as a decent answer to many common threats in the tier, such as Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Fairy, Mega Salamence, and Dragon Dance Rayquaza.</li> <li>It is able to recover HP very easily with Leftovers, Leech Seed, and Protect, which makes it very hard to wear down and very annoying to beat in a one-on-one situation.</li> <li>Unlike most common bulky Steel-type Pokemon used in the tier such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, Magearna, and support Necrozma-DM, Celesteela also provides its team with an immunity to Ground-type attacks, which is a trait that it only shares with Skarmory. However, unlike Skarmory, Celesteela tends to wear down foes with a combination of Leech Seed and Toxic as well as threaten frailer Pokemon with Heavy Slam.</li> <li>Celesteela is relatively passive, and it is therefore quite easily trapped by Shadow Tag users such as Gothitelle and Mega Gengar. That being said, Mega Gengar does have to be careful when dealing with Celesteela, as it is 2HKOed by Heavy Slam.</li> <li>Celesteela is shut down relatively easily by Pokemon that utilize Substitute and setup moves, such as Primal Kyogre, Zygarde-C, and Arceus-Ground, as Pokemon behind a Substitute are immune to Leech Seed and Toxic. Furthermore, many of the aforementioned Substitute users can avoid having their Substitute broken by Heavy Slam by resisting Steel-type attacks, having enough natural bulk, or investing enough EVs in Defense. This causes Celesteela to become setup fodder for these Pokemon.</li> <li>Unfortunately, due to the passive nature of Celesteela, it struggles to effectively utilize its ability Beast Boost, as it is quite easily revenge killed by an opposing dedicated check.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Fire Blast or Flamethrower can be useful for dealing with opposing Steel-types and preventing Celesteela from being setup fodder for Mega Lucario and Ferrothorn. However, Celesteela can't really afford to sacrifice anything in its moveset in order to run Fire-type coverage.</li> <li>Substitute can be useful in place of Toxic, as Celesteela can PP stall super effective moves such as Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire. However, Toxic is much more useful for wearing down foes, and having Toxic means Celesteela will be able to more efficiently recover HP, as it isn't losing any health from using Substitute.</li> <li>Flame Charge can be used to boost Celesteela's Speed by one stage and can be useful when combined with Substitute, as Celesteela is able to quickly set up a Substitute without having to take damage beforehand.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-type Attacks</strong>: Fire-type Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon are both unfazed by Celesteela's attacks and are able to deal heavy amounts of damage with Fire-type attacks. Celesteela also doesn't appreciate having to deal with Fire-type coverage moves from Pokemon like, Naganadel, Rayquaza, and Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye: Mega Sableye can bounce back Leech Seed and Toxic and easily recover off any damage from Heavy Slam.</p> <p><strong>Shadow Tag Trappers</strong>: Pokemon with Shadow Tag such as Gothitelle and Mega Gengar are able to trap Celesteela. Gothitelle is able to recover the damage dealt by Celesteela and PP stall it thanks to Rest, and Mega Gengar can cause a trade.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Celesteela tends to invest its EVs in Defense in order to deal with physical attackers. It takes heavy damage from neutral special attacks from Pokemon such as Yveltal, Primal Kyogre, and Palkia.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-type Pokemon are immune to Toxic and take minimal damage from Heavy Slam. Ferrothorn is an especially notable example, since it is immune to Leech Seed, can set its own Leech Seed back, and can set up hazards in front of Celesteela. Mega Lucario is able to set up and then OHKO Celesteela with +2 Close Combat. Necrozma-DM is only really fazed by Leech Seed, and therefore it is able to freely set up against Celesteela. Dialga is able to 2HKO Celesteela if it runs Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde-C: All variants of Zygarde-C are rather unfazed by any of Celesteela's attacks. RestTalk variants are able to recover off any damage that Celesteela dishes out and 3HKO it with Thousand Arrows. Substitute + Dragon Dance variants get a free Substitute against Celesteela and are able to set up easily, since Heavy Slam has a very little chance to break Zygarde-C's Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Users</strong>: Substitute users are often problematic for Celesteela, as in many cases, Heavy Slam doesn't do enough damage to break the foe's Substitute, which then allows Pokemon like Primal Kyogre and Zygarde-C to set up for free.</p> <p><strong>Electric-type Attacks</strong>: Although Electric-type Pokemon are rare and not considered to be very viable, Zekrom and Arceus-Electric are able to deal heavy amounts of damage to Celesteela with their STAB attacks. Celesteela also dislikes taking Electric-type attacks from other Pokemon, such as Thunder from Xerneas, Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, and Primal Kyogre.</p> ",

Try to use this move liberally if you think that your opponent is going to switch their Pokemon, as Celesteela can help wear down Pokemon that would otherwise counter it with Leech Seed + Protect.</li> <li>Heavy Slam stops Celesteela from being completely passive and should be used to wear down foes alongside Leech Seed, Toxic, and Protect, pick off foes that have been worn down, and deal decent damage to frailer foes such as Deoxys-A, Mega Gengar, Xerneas, and Mega Diancie. It is also useful for breaking Substitute from frailer foes, such as Mega Salamence and Mega Gengar. Heavy Slam is also Celesteela's only way of dealing damage to Mega Sableye and Mega Diancie.</li> <li>Spamming Toxic to slowly wear down foes is incredibly useful, as this helps make things easier for other teammates to KO them and puts pressure on clerics such as Choice Scarf Xerneas, which is the most common cleric on offensive builds and dealt with by Celesteela quite easily.</li> <li>Use Protect in order to scout for coverage moves from Primal Groudon, Calm Mind Arceus formes, and Choice-locked Pokemon such as Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Xerneas.</li> <li>Celesteela has to be careful to not take Fire- or Electric-type attacks from common threats such as Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, Xerneas, mixed Rayquaza, mixed Primal Kyogre, and Naganadel.</li> <li>Celesteela also tends to not run any EVs in Special Defense if it wishes to effectively act as a physical wall, so it should avoid taking any damage from common special attackers such as Yveltal, Primal Kyogre, Lunala, and Naganadel.</li> <li>Although Celesteela is a complete deadweight against Gothitelle, it is possible for it to deal with Mega Gengar, as it 2HKOes Mega Gengar with Heavy Slam and is able to potentially deal with more aggressive variants if it correctly predicts when Mega Gengar uses Taunt and Destiny Bond.</li> <li>Avoid staying in against setup sweepers with Substitute, as Pokemon are immune to Leech Seed and Toxic when behind a Substitute. Primal Kyogre and Zygarde-C are especially noteworthy examples, as even when Celesteela invests EVs into Attack, Heavy Slam still fails to break their Substitute.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Celesteela is a defensive wall that is much better at taking hits, rather than dishing them out. Therefore, it tends to fit well on teams of a similar nature.</li> <li>Pursuit users such as Marshadow and Tyranitar are nice partners for Celesteela, as they are able to trap and remove the two main Shadow Tag users in the tier, Gothitelle and Mega Gengar. It should be noted that Marshadow doesn't appreciate taking Ghost-type attacks from Mega Gengar and Tyranitar dislikes facing Mega Gengar variants with Focus Blast.</li> <li>Many different variants of Primal Groudon make useful partners for Celesteela. The defensive set is able to set Stealth Rock for Celesteela, which punishes just about every viable Pokemon in the tier when they switch in, ultimately making it easier for Celesteela to wear down foes. Primal Groudon can also quite easily deal with Power Herb Xerneas and Swords Dance Necrozma-DM as well as other Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Mega Lucario, and Dialga. Defensive Primal Groudon also provides the team with a potential switch-in to Primal Kyogre, which is only really annoyed by Leech Seed and Toxic. Mixed Rock Polish Primal Groudon is able to take care of Zygarde before it transforms into Zygarde-C with Hidden Power Ice, and variants with Rock-type coverage are able to KO Ho-Oh, which otherwise 2HKOes Celesteela with Sacred Fire.</li> <li>Primal Kyogre is useful, as its ability makes it immune to Fire-type attacks and it threatens Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh with powerful Water-type attacks.</li> <li>Arceus-Water is able to remove Stealth Rock for Celesteela with Defog, as well as acting as a reasonable check to Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Arceus-Ground is also able to remove Stealth Rock for Celesteela with Defog and deal with Primal Groudon, as well as Mega Lucario, Zygarde-C, and Necrozma-DM to an extent.</li> <li>Zygarde-C is a brilliant partner both offensively and defensively, as it is able to deal with Pokemon that threaten Celesteela such as Mega Lucario, Primal Groudon, and Ho-Oh. Zygarde-C also appreciates the fact that Celesteela can threaten many of the Pokemon it dislikes dealing with, such as Arceus-Fairy, Arceus-Ground, and Choice Scarf Xerneas.</li> <li>Yveltal also pairs well with Celesteela, as it pressures trappers such as Gothitelle and Mega Gengar.

    "overview": "<ul> <li>Necrozma-DM stands as one of the best Pokemon in the tier. Its typing, ability, movepool, and general offensive presence all contribute to nearly unmatched levels of utility and versatility.</li> <li>While Necrozma-DM's offensive typing isn't great, it has an expansive pool of coverage moves and setup options and access to an immensely powerful Z-Move, Searing Sunraze Smash, all of which narrow its defensive counterplay.</li> <li>The combination of Necrozma-DM's typing and ability makes it the strongest check to Xerneas and enables it to blanket check the majority of setup sweepers. This allows Necrozma-DM to provide valuable defensive utility to its team regardless of its set.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM's potential can be expanded even further through Ultra Burst with Ultranecrozium Z. A sudden change in typing and a boost in Speed allow Necrozma-DM to have an upper hand against threats it otherwise cannot beat and overcome its slow Speed after transforming.</li> <li>Although Rock Polish, Trick Room, and Ultra Burst alleviate the problem to a degree, Necrozma-DM's below-average Speed is a notable downside, as this forces it to often move last. When combined with its vulnerability against priority moves from the likes of Yveltal and Marshadow, Necrozma-DM's effectiveness as an offensive threat is somewhat limited.</li> <li>Due to its disappointing STAB combination, Necrozma-DM tends to be reliant on prior damage, boosts, Z-Moves, or sometimes all of these to surmount defensive Pokemon, although an immunity to Toxic improves its matchup against many defensive Pokemon to an extent.</li> <li>Gaining a boost in Speed and Neuroforce through Ultra Burst can remedy these shortcomings, but due to the fact that Necrozma-DM forfeits its Steel typing, a considerable portion of its bulk, and Prism Armor during the process, it becomes more vulnerable to revenge killing.</li> <li>While Necrozma-DM's typing lets it blanket check a large number of threats, it also leaves it vulnerable to very common threats in the tier, such as Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, Mega Gengar, Yveltal, and Marshadow, due to its common weaknesses to Dark, Fire, Ghost, and Ground.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Necrozma-DM can employ a Swords Dance + 3 attacks set to maximize its coverage, but this leaves it vulnerable to offensive teams packed with faster threats, particularly offensive Primal Groudon variants and Mega Gengar.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Though it isn't a reliable defensive check, Yveltal is a troublesome threat for both Necrozma-DM and Ultra Necrozma. On top of naturally outspeeding Necrozma-DM and being able to hit it super effectively, Yveltal can revenge kill both formes with Sucker Punch if prior damage was taken while setting up. While offensive variants of Yveltal cannot switch into Searing Sunraze Smash and any set falls to Ultra Necrozma's boosted Stone Edge, Choice Scarf Yveltal can easily revenge kill Ultra Necrozma if given a safe switch. Arceus-Dark can survive unboosted Searing Sunraze Smash from Necrozma-DM and easily checks any Ultra Necrozma that lacks Outrage. Mega Sableye completely shuts down defensive Necrozma-DM, survives +2 Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike from full HP, and easily handles any Ultra Necrozma lacking Outrage.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh: Ho-Oh proves to be a solid check to Necrozma-DM, as it outspeeds Necrozma-DM, can switch into any move apart from Stone Edge, and can threaten back with Sacred Fire. Ultra Necrozma outspeeds Ho-Oh and can defeat it with Stone Edge, Power Gem, boosted Photon Geyser, or Light That Burns the Sky, but physical variants must be wary of burn from Sacred Fire.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde-C</strong>: While Zygarde-C is not capable of handling boosted Z-Moves from both Necrozma formes, it can otherwise defensively keep both formes in check and respond with Glare, which heavily limits their usefulness. Offensive Zygarde-C can potentially set up on Necrozma-DM, but it must be wary of directly taking Searing Sunraze Smash while it isn't behind Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Mega Gengar has various ways to hinder both formes of Necrozma. Depending on the variant, Mega Gengar can neuter Necrozma-DM's damage output with Will-O-Wisp or at worst cause inflict a serious damage with Shadow Ball, leaving it unable to check foes like Xerneas. Mega Gengar also easily traps and eliminates Ultra Necrozma once given a safe switch.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon: Primal Groudon struggles with any Necrozma-DM and Ultra Necrozma variant with Earthquake, but defensive variants are capable of checking +2 Necrozma-DM and KOing back. Ultra Necrozma is capable of defeating Primal Groudon in one-on-one situation, but it still takes major damage while combating or setting up on it.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Primal Kyogre is capable of offensively checking Necrozma-DM once its Z-Move has been used. Arceus-Water and Mega Slowbro can survive boosted Searing Sunraze Smash and status Necrozma-DM in return. Although Ultranecrozium Z variants can set up on Water-types, they still must be wary of burns from Scald, which is occasionally seen from Primal Kyogre and Mega Slowbro.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Ferrothorn and Dialga can take advantage of defensive Necrozma-DM to set up entry hazards or wear it down with appropriate moves, but they are overpowered by setup variants of Necrozma-DM.

Common Choice Scarf users such as Xerneas can revenge kill Ultra Necrozma after Ultra Burst if they were given a safe switch.

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Trick Room combined with Swords Dance turns Necrozma-DM into an effective late-game sweeper. Trick Room is Necrozma-DM's preferred way to gain a Speed advantage, as this allows it to invest in bulk and take a surprising amount of damage while it sets up.</li> <li>Sunsteel Strike easily OHKOes offensive Xerneas and is able to brute force its way through many checks that resist the attack with the added power given by Solganium Z, taken further with boosts from Swords Dance.</li> <li>Earthquake offers the best coverage from a single move alongside Sunsteel Strike and targets many Steel-resistant Pokemon such as Primal Groudon, opposing Necrozma-DM, and Primal Kyogre.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Maximum HP and Attack investment maximizes Necrozma-DM's bulk and power.</li> <li>A Brave nature and 0 Speed IVs slow Necrozma-DM down as much as possible to improve its Speed in Trick Room.</li> <li>An alternative variant that uses Rock Polish over Trick Room and Speed investment over HP can be considered for offensive teams that suffer too much under Trick Room's effect should Necrozma-DM be forced out, but losing bulk harms the set's overall potential.</li> <li>Solganium Z offers Necrozma-DM a potent nuke that can kickstart a sweep against targets that could take a boosted Sunsteel Strike or Earthquake.</li> <li>Weakness Policy is an alternative option that takes advantage of Necrozma-DM's high bulk and Prism Armor to take various super effective attacks and reduce the need for multiple setup turns to sweep.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Keep Necrozma-DM around until later in the game when checks such as Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Yveltal are sufficiently weakened. Arceus-Water and Ho-Oh can also be significant stops to this set to the point that sweeping is rarely possible while they are around.</li> <li>Offensive teams find themselves weakest to Trick Room Necrozma-DM later in the game, as they lose offensive checks and struggle to take it down immediately, leading to them having the tables turned on them by Trick Room.</li> <li>This set can be used earlier in order to force damage onto an enemy Pokemon for a teammate's benefit if need be.</li> <li>If the opponent has multiple checks to Necrozma-DM, sometimes taking down just one of them is enough for Necrozma-DM to be able to use its high bulk to set up in front of another check and break through it. It is capable of taking a wide range of super effective attacks from the likes of support Arceus formes, Marshadow, and even some Primal Groudon sets while setting up. Be aware of the damage this set can take to find chances to set up.</li> <li>Be aware that while Necrozma-DM can be defensively checked by Arceus formes and some defensive Steel-types, in many cases all they can do is status, phaze, or delay the inevitable. If Necrozma-DM isn't actually neutralized or taken down quickly, it can continue to boost in front of various Pokemon until it breaks through them.</li> <li>Remember that Necrozma-DM likely needs two turns of setup to pose a sweeping threat, although Weakness Policy sets can reduce this if successfully triggered. Many offensive checks to Necrozma-DM such as Yveltal take advantage of this and switch in immediately, and this aggression can be used against them.</li> <li>Trick Room Necrozma-DM can importantly be used to check Geomancy Xerneas but shouldn't be switched in freely to conserve HP and should instead come in after Geomancy has been used. By taking a hit and using Trick Room before KOing a boosted Xerneas, Necrozma-DM can also get a free attack against the next Pokemon to come in.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Trick Room Necrozma-DM best fits offensive teams that are looking for a good option against opposing offensive teams. As such, offensive entry hazard setters along with various wallbreakers and sweepers are ideal partners.</li> <li>Primal Groudon has a couple of Stealth Rock sets that can be useful to Trick Room Necrozma-DM. Physical sets with Swords Dance and Stealth Rock can put effective pressure on Ho-Oh and support Arceus formes, while specially oriented sets can better target Ground-immune Steel-types, Zygarde, and Arceus-Ground. Stealth Rock sets with Toxic can spread status against Arceus formes while the rest of the team put out enough pressure to prevent Heal Bell.</li> <li>Mega Salamence is an effective partner that can check enemy Primal Groudon and get damage onto support Arceus formes and Primal Kyogre for Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Geomancy Xerneas can pressure Primal Groudon and pose a sweeping threat to teams. Arceus-Fairy can also accomplish this in a less offensive way.</li> <li>Mega Gengar can trap and remove Arceus-Water while pressuring various other Necrozma-DM checks.</li> <li>Naganadel is a strong offensive partner that pressures various Arceus formes with its Nasty Plot set.</li> <li>Yveltal does well against many Necrozma-DM checks, and together they offensively check a good amount of Pokemon, making it a great pairing.</li> </ul> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Thanks to its high Speed, Ultra Necrozma can threaten most teams once it manages to boost its Attack with Swords Dance.</li> <li>Photon Geyser hits foes like Ho-Oh and Water-types that Necrozma-DM cannot effectively hit with its conventional sets. It is notably capable of OHKOing Mega Gengar after Stealth Rock even when Necrozma-DM is burned.</li> <li>Earthquake provides Ultra Necrozma with vital coverage against Primal Groudon and Steel-types.</li> <li>Stone Edge breaks through problematic Flying-types like Yveltal and Lugia, as well as letting Ultra Necrozma better deal with Ho-Oh and Mega Salamence.</li> <li>Rock Blast is an alternative Rock-type coverage move that can defeat Lugia and Charti Berry Yveltal more reliably and occasionally OHKO Smeargle through Focus Sash thanks to the move hitting multiple times. The move reduces Ultra Necrozma's reliance on Stealth Rock to defeat certain Flying-types, but its inconsistent damage output can prove to be detrimental.</li> <li>Outrage provides Ultra Necrozma with a stronger STAB move. On top of giving Ultra Necrozma an immediate way to dispose of regular Zygarde, boosted Outrage also OHKOes foes like Ho-Oh, Yveltal, Mega Sableye, and support Arceus formes with or without prior damage. However, getting locked into Outrage is dangerous, as this leaves Ultra Necrozma vulnerable to revenge killing.</li> <li>Sunsteel Strike offers Ultra Necrozma a coverage move against Fairy-types and also enables Necrozma to check Xerneas before Ultra Burst.</li> <li>Brick Break lets Ultra Necrozma defeat Ferrothorn without relying on a second Swords Dance or a Z-Move and has a considerable chance to OHKO Arceus-Dark after a Swords Dance and Stealth Rock damage.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>28 HP and 8 Defense EVs prevent Life Orb Marshadow from OHKOing Ultra Necrozma after it switches into Stealth Rock and allow Necrozma to check Geomancy Xerneas in its Dusk Mane forme.</li> <li>Maximum Speed EVs with a Jolly nature allow Ultra Necrozma to take advantage of its high Speed tier, letting it outspeed all Arceus formes and Marshadow. The rest of the EVs are allotted to Attack to maximize Ultra Necrozma's damage output.</li> <li>Ultranecrozium Z allows Necrozma-DM with Photon Geyser to undergo Ultra Burst and transform into Ultra Necrozma. The Z-Crystal also gives Ultra Necrozma access to Light That Burns the Sky, which puts a significant dent in most neutral targets.</li> <li>Neuroforce boosts Ultra Necrozma's super effective attacks, allowing it to OHKO foes like Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence, and various Arceus formes with appropriate moves after a Swords Dance.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>As there is no feasible way to identify Necrozma-DM's potency to transform and Ultra Burst changes Necrozma-DM's typing, this set can take advantage of foes it previously could not. Take advantage of foes' tendencies to hit Necrozma-DM with Fire- and Ground-type moves, which Ultra Necrozma can survive. A sudden increase in Speed allows Ultra Necrozma to revenge kill a threat it would not outspeed in Dusk Mane forme.</li> <li>Staying in Dusk Mane forme is beneficial in specific occasions. An immunity to Toxic prior to Ultra Burst is handy, especially against defensive teams. The defensive typing prior to Ultra Burst also lets Necrozma-DM check Fairy-types and potentially revenge kill a dangerous foe after surviving a hit with Prism Armor, so refrain from recklessly activating Ultra Burst until foes that Necrozma has to check in Dusk Mane forme are no longer posing a threat.</li> <li>Revenge killers like Mega Gengar, Yveltal, and Marshadow can cut Ultra Necrozma's sweep short, so ensure they can be dealt with beforehand. The former is especially problematic due to it simply trapping and disposing of Ultra Necrozma, while the latter two can easily take it out with or without prior damage.</li> <li>Bear in mind that Ultra Necrozma cannot use Light That Burns the Sky on the turn it transforms. The Z-Move is also resisted by many common foes, and Dark-types are immune to it, so be prepared to predict against teams with Dark- and Steel-types, or ensure that they have been weakened or eliminated beforehand.</li> <li>Ultra Necrozma is much more vulnerable to revenge killing than Necrozma-DM, so scout possible Choice Scarf users like Xerneas and Yveltal.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Stealth Rock support is very helpful to this set, as it punishes Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Lugia should they switch in and attempt to check Ultra Necrozma. Offensive users like Primal Groudon, Dialga, and Arceus-Ground are helpful, as Necrozma-DM isn't too threatening before transforming with Ultra Burst.</li> <li>A secondary check to Fairy-types is necessary, as Necrozma-DM no longer checks them after Ultra Burst. Magearna, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn are solid backups that can aid Ultra Necrozma with pivoting or entry hazard support.</li> <li>Ultra Necrozma is vulnerable to Dark- and Ghost-types before and after Ultra Burst. Yveltal is a solid switch-in for them and threatens Ghost-types, while Marshadow can be a good partner as well thanks to its ability to threaten every relevant Ghost-type. Both Pokemon are excellent anti-offense Pokemon that appreciate Ultra Necrozma's ability to break through defensive cores.</li> <li>Ultra Necrozma can take advantage of its typing before or after Ultra Burst to set up on Arceus-Water, Arceus-Ground, and Arceus-Fairy. This is valued for partners like Rock Polish Primal Groudon, Mega Salamence, and Choice Scarf Xerneas and Yveltal. The former two provide valuable defensive utility for Ultra Necrozma. Xerneas resists Dark-type attacks, is immune to Dragon-type attacks, and provides cleric support, which is always useful. Yveltal can safely bring in Necrozma with U-turn and more effectively threatens Ghost-types.</li> <li>Tapu Lele summons Psychic Terrain, which boosts the power of Psychic-type moves, letting Ultra Necrozma OHKO maximum HP Arceus formes with Light That Burns the Sky and making boosted Photon Geyser ridiculously hard to defensively handle. The terrain also protects Ultra Necrozma from priority attacks from Pokemon like Yveltal and Marshadow, which are the most common offensive checks to Ultra Necrozma.</li> <li>Sticky Web is a viable strategy, as this gives Ultra Necrozma room to breathe against some foes prior to Ultra Burst, and prevents Ultra Necrozma from getting easily disposed of by Mega Gengar and Choice Scarf Xerneas. Smeargle is a reliable Sticky Web setter, and Taunt users like Yveltal and Tapu Lele synergize well with such a build.</li> </ul> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Necrozma-DM's immunity to Toxic, increased durability with defensive investment, and ability to punish many Defog users with Toxic make it a good Stealth Rock user.</li> <li>Toxic punishes Defog users like Arceus-Ground and Giratina-O and offensive checks like Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Swords Dance is an alternative option to pressure Defog users and Mega Sableye. Necrozma-DM can use various passive Pokemon as setup fodder thanks to its bulk, immunity to Toxic, and access to recovery. Swords Dance also allows Necrozma-DM to defeat Gothitelle and Z-Geomancy Xerneas more reliably.</li> <li>Sunsteel Strike lets Necrozma-DM check Fairy-types, and it still has good damage output without investment. Boosted Sunsteel Strike and Searing Sunraze Smash from uninvested Necrozma-DM is still capable of KOing many offensive foes.</li> <li>Morning Sun increases Necrozma-DM's longevity, letting it consistently set Stealth Rock and switch into foes it is tasked to check.</li> <li>Both Toxic and Swords Dance can be run at the cost of forgoing Stealth Rock, if there's already a solid Stealth Rock user on the team. Toxic helps Necrozma-DM facilitate its own sweep by putting its checks on a timer on the switch and bluffing its passivity until it can start setting up Swords Dance to begin its sweep.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>A fully specially defensive EV spread makes Necrozma-DM a strong check to Xerneas and the majority of support Arceus formes. The EV spread also allows Necrozma-DM to avoid 2HKO from support Arceus-Ground's Judgment, letting it stall out Arceus-Ground with Toxic.</li> <li>Leftovers provide Necrozma-DM with passive recovery, increasing its resilience to residual damage and lessening its reliance on Morning Sun. Solganium Z can be used to give Necrozma-DM a significantly greater offensive presence and prevent Gothitelle from trapping and neutralizing it.</li> <li>A physically defensive EV spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with an Impish nature can be used to better handle Mega Salamence and Rayquaza and even avoid 2HKO from Life Orb Marshadow with Leftovers recovery.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Necrozma-DM will have ample opportunities to switch into Fairy-types, support Arceus formes, and predicted Toxic. The best it can usually do is set Stealth Rock to start pressuring the opposing team. It is the best to use Toxic against Defog users to put them on a timer and prevent them from freely removing Stealth Rock, but Toxic is also handy for punishing predictable switch-ins like Primal Groudon and other defensive checks like Arceus-Water.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM is quite bulky with investment and Prism Armor. It is capable of Toxic stalling support Arceus-Ground thanks to it avoiding the 2HKO from Judgment and defensive Primal Groudon due to Morning Sun's increased recovery in sun. However, it is also important to keep track of the damage Necrozma-DM takes from strong attacks and switch it out of strong attackers like Yveltal, which is capable of easily 2HKOing it.</li> <li>When running Swords Dance, revealing Toxic or Stealth Rock early will usually relieve opponents of pressure, as they will most likely assume that Necrozma-DM will lack offensive presence. This is especially useful for luring in defensive walls and using them as setup fodder and luring Mega Sableye and taking it out with boosted attacks. Necrozma-DM with Solganium Z is also capable of outright taking out Geomancy Xerneas and OHKOing offensive Yveltal and Mega Salamence after Stealth Rock damage.</li> <li>Use Sunsteel Strike and Morning Sun with caution, as their low PP can severely limit Necrozma-DM's usefulness in the long run if the moves were mindlessly used.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>As this set lacks a feasible way to deal with Ground- and Fire-types other than punishing them with Toxic, checks to them are recommended. Mega Salamence, Zygarde-C, Arceus-Water, and Arceus-Dragon can check Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh. The latter two are especially helpful with dealing with Mega Salamence as well, since Mega Salamence can set up on Necrozma-DM lacking Swords Dance.</li> <li>More reliable Ground-immune teammates include Giratina-O, Ho-Oh, and Yveltal. The former two are strong checks to defensive Primal Groudon and can spread status to various foes, which helps Necrozma-DM lacking Toxic. As both of them dislike Toxic, Necrozma-DM's ability to pivot into said status move is appreciated. Yveltal pressures Defog users, checks Ghost-types, overwhelms physically defensive foes, and appreciates Necrozma-DM functioning as a strong check to Fairy-types.</li> <li>Necrozma-DM lacking Swords Dance has little use against defensive teams. As Necrozma-DM compresses the role of a Stealth Rock setter, status spreader, and consistent blockade against Toxic users and Fairy-types, Pokemon that are otherwise obligated to compress these roles by themselves can run more offensive sets to cover Necrozma-DM's mentioned downside. The most obvious example is Primal Groudon, which is no longer obligated to run Stealth Rock and has freedom to run offensive sets like Swords Dance to heavily pressure defensive cores. Necrozma-DM carrying Stealth Rock also frees a team slot for more offensive Pokemon; stallbreakers like Swords Dance Arceus-Ground, Primal Kyogre, and Rayquaza can break through defensive teams while appreciating the utility Necrozma-DM provides.</li> <li>Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy are solid answers to all relevant Dark-types. Xerneas's cleric support is useful to Necrozma-DM as well, since burns leave it very passive. Arceus-Fairy has more freedom with movesets, as Necrozma-DM employs Stealth Rock, Toxic, or both. It can lure and cripple problematic Steel-types with Will-O-Wisp or alleviate Necrozma-DM's inability to set or keep Stealth Rock up against defensive teams by pressuring Mega Sableye and Giratina, by running Stealth Rock itself. It is important to note, however, that Necrozma-DM and Fairy-types are all vulnerable to Mega Gengar, and they struggle against Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh.</li> <li>Arceus formes with Will-O-Wisp, clerics, and certain Defog users can prove problematic to this set. Mega Gengar and Gothitelle can trap and remove most of them.</li> </ul> "

It also 2HKOes physically defensive Mega Sableye.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>The given EV spread will allow Ultra Necrozma to take Marshadow's Shadow Sneak after Stealth Rock damage while also maximizing Speed and damage output.</li> <li>The use of 0 Attack IVs and a Timid nature have the noticeable benefit of surviving a Foul Play from the likes of Mega Sableye and Tyranitar at full health. This is more relevant to Dragon Pulse variants, as they can successfully take on the rare Mega Sableye one-on-one.</li> <li>Ultranecrozium Z is required to utilize Ultra Necrozma and Light That Burns the Sky and is therefore key to the set.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>This set tends to use Ultra Burst early to surprise the opponent with an uncommon coverage move or to use Ultra Necrozma's Speed and typing to set Stealth Rock and gain other advantages.</li> <li>There are some occasions where holding off on using Ultra Burst can be beneficial. Necrozma-DM can handle Fairy-type attacks better and lure in Primal Groudon, which may see the usage of Stealth Rock and assume the wrong set, which can be used to your advantage.</li> <li>Having Ultra Necrozma ready to use Light That Burns the Sky against a threat is key to pressuring offensive Pokemon that threaten it and taking out support Arceus formes that may try to use Defog. It takes only a small amount of chip for the likes of Arceus-Ground to fall to a Z-Move, and many offensive Pokemon such as Xerneas and Zygarde are immediately OHKOed.</li> <li>With the previous point in mind, take note that once Ultra Necrozma has used Light That Burns the Sky, its neutral damage can be lacking and lead to Pokemon taking advantage of it. It can be kept around to make use of its high Speed to revenge kill targets, but setting Stealth Rock and keeping it up is the main goal.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>This variant of Ultra Necrozma is best utilized by offensive teams that can keep up pressure and reduce the need for defensive checks. Balance teams can also fit this set in order to free another Pokemon from the Stealth Rock role.</li> <li>Primal Groudon benefits greatly by Ultra Necrozma taking the role of setting Stealth Rock in its place. This leaves Primal Groudon able to run a variety of offensive sets to break through teams, such as mixed Swords Dance and Rock Polish variants.</li> <li>Due to the choice of using Ultra Necrozma and a more offensive Primal Groudon set, this tends to leave teams with weaker answers to Geomancy Xerneas. Priority users such as Marshadow and Extreme Killer Arceus pair well with Ultra Necrozma to offensively check it.</li> <li>Steel-types such as Magearna and Mega Scizor can also work alongside Stealth Rock Ultra Necrozma on teams that desire a more defensive backbone against Pokemon Necrozma-DM typically aims to check.</li> <li>Wallbreakers such as Primal Kyogre, Yveltal, and Mega Gengar all pair well with Ultra Necrozma by adding additional offensive pressure to limit enemy Defog usage.

    "overview": "<ul> <li>At a first glance, Necrozma-DW may seem like a more powerful wallbreaker than Lunala. However, numerous factors undermine Necrozma-DW's effectiveness to the point where there are barely any viable options for it to use.</li> <li>Necrozma-DW lacks Shadow Shield, and combined with its low Speed and lack of resistances, it is vulnerable to almost every offensive foe that outspeeds it. Prism Armor does not alleviate Necrozma-DW's extreme weakness to very common threats like Yveltal, Mega Gengar, and Marshadow at all, and its lack of usable coverage moves leaves Necrozma-DW with only a few foes that it can defeat.</li> <li>Due to Species Clause, Necrozma-DW cannot be used alongside Necrozma-DM at the same time. Deciding to employ Necrozma-DW over Necrozma-DM and forgo excellent utility options that Necrozma-DM would otherwise provide to the team leads to a question about opportunity cost.</li> <li>For these reasons, Necrozma-DW is an unviable Pokemon in the tier. However, thanks to Necrozma-DW's Ghost typing, it can be used over Necrozma-DM on teams that appreciate an offensive spinblocker. As Necrozma-DW can viably utilize a Swords Dance set with Ultranecrozium Z, it can justify use on Sticky Web teams and simultaneously function as a spinblocker and wallbreaker.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>A set with Lunalium Z and Calm Mind or Trick Room may seem usable on Necrozma-DW, but Calm Mind sets are utterly outclassed by Lunala, as the extra power does not provide Necrozma-DW with any significant benchmarks. Sets attempting to utilize Trick Room also suffer from Necrozma-DW's inability to reliably set up against most of the tier.</li> <li>As Necrozma-DW can transform into Ultra Necrozma with Moongeist Beam, a set with Calm Mind may seem usable. This set can also attempt fitting in Brick Break to lure and punish Tyranitar, Chansey, and Blissey. However, Moongeist Beam lacks relevant targets apart from hitting the rare Mega Slowbro and Lugia. Lugia is already dealt with boosted Stone Edge, and uninvested Brick Break fails to 2HKO Arceus-Dark even after Stealth Rock damage.</li> <li>Necrozma-DW is one of the very few Ghost-types that can set Stealth Rock, but it is generally hard to fit, and finding an opportunity to successfully set it is quite difficult.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Yveltal immensely threatens Necrozma-DW before and after Ultra Bursting, as Dark Pulse cleanly OHKOes both formes and Sucker Punch allows Yveltal to bypass Ultra Necrozma's Speed. However, it cannot handle boosted Stone Edge and its effectiveness as an offensive check can be diminished if Psychic Terrain is active. Choice Scarf Yveltal can revenge kill Ultra Necrozma easily if it switched in safely. Both Arceus-Dark and Mega Sableye are solid defensive checks to Ultra Necrozma lacking Outrage.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Ground-immune Steel-types, namely Skarmory and Celesteela, comfortably take on Ultra Necrozma and are only concerned about a boosted Z-Move. Other Steel-types like Necrozma-DM and Dialga are less effective checks due to their vulnerability to Earthquake, but they can take on unboosted Ultra Necrozma.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Priority moves, such as Shadow Sneak from Marshadow and Giratina-O and Sucker Punch from Yveltal, easily dispose of Ultra Necrozma if it has taken some prior damage. Mega Gengar and Choice Scarf Xerneas can OHKO Ultra Necrozma, but they cannot contend against it if Sticky Web is on the field.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Foes: Support Arceus formes are not OHKOed by Ultra Necrozma unless it is boosted and has its Z-Move available, and they can remove entry hazards with Defog, which is detrimental especially if Ultra Necrozma is reliant on Sticky Web or Stealth Rock to bypass its checks. Other bulky foes like Zygarde-C and Lugia can check Ultra Necrozma with their sheer bulk, but the former's efficiency as a check varies on how well the opponent activated Power Construct and whether or not Necrozma-DW has Outrage, and Lugia fails to check Ultra Necrozma if Stealth Rock is up.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Swords Dance boosts Ultra Necrozma's damage output to the point where it can easily KO offensive foes and pressure defensive foes.</li> <li>STAB Photon Geyser has high damage output, and it becomes Light That Burns the Sky with Ultranecrozium Z.</li> <li>Earthquake provides Ultra Necrozma with a valuable coverage move to hit Steel-types and common threats like Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Stone Edge rounds out Ultra Necrozma's coverage by hitting certain Flying-types like Yveltal and Lugia, which would prove to be serious problems to this set. Necrozma-DW's tendency to draw in Yveltal prior to Ultra Bursting makes Stone Edge an effective way to punish it.</li> <li>Rock Blast can be used instead of Stone Edge to better handle Lugia and Charti Berry variants of Yveltal, but its inconsistency can be hazardous.</li> <li>Outrage serves as another move to punish Dark-types and other bulky foes that hope to take on Ultra Necrozma with their typing. At +2, Outrage is capable of OHKOing conventional checks like Yveltal and Mega Sableye and, with Stealth Rock up, Arceus-Dark and Lugia.</li> <li>Brick Break can help Ultra Necrozma lure and punish Dark-types like Arceus-Dark and Tyranitar, but its low damage against Yveltal and inability to hit Mega Sableye leaves Outrage as generally a better method to combat them.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>32 Defense EVs ensure that Ultra Necrozma survives Life Orb Marshadow's Shadow Sneak after Stealth Rock damage. Speed is maximized to outspeed Marshadow and Shaymin-Sky and tie with opposing Ultra Necrozma, while the remainder of the EVs are invested in Attack to maximize Ultra Necrozma's damage output.</li> <li>Ultranecrozium Z gives Necrozma-DW an access to Ultra Burst, letting it overcome its low Speed and drastically improve its offensive stats when its spinblocking utility is no longer needed. Ultranecrozium Z also allows Ultra Necrozma to use Light That Burns the Sky.</li> <li>Neuroforce makes super effective moves more powerful, allowing Ultra Necrozma to score OHKOs with boosted Earthquake and Stone Edge on foes like Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Yveltal.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Necrozma-DW's disappointing defensive typing heavily limits its opportunity to switch into most attacks. Apart from offensively checking Mewtwo and occasionally switching into predicted Normal- or Fighting-type moves, it is recommended for Necrozma-DW to be switched in to block Rapid Spin from Cloyster or Excadrill or revenge kill a foe.</li> <li>It is very rare that Necrozma-DW's defensive typing is better than Ultra Necrozma's defensive typing, so Ultra Burst as soon as Necrozma-DW's spinblocking utility is no longer needed so Ultra Necrozma can start pressuring Rapid Spin users or any foe it is contending against. Ultra Bursting also allows Necrozma-DW to overcome its underwhelming Speed and threaten significantly more foes.</li> <li>Be quick to set up Swords Dance by taking advantage of defensive foes or forced switches. This allows Ultra Necrozma to pressure foes, particularly Defog users, helping Ultra Necrozma keep entry hazards on the field after it has lost its Ghost typing after Ultra Bursting.</li> <li>Light That Burns the Sky cannot be used until the turn after Necrozma-DW has used Ultra Burst. The Z-Move should also be used with caution, as its availability has crucial influence on Ultra Necrozma's matchup against the likes of support Arceus formes.</li> <li>While Ultra Necrozma is capable of rampaging through most teams after a Swords Dance, foes like Mega Gengar, Choice Scarf Xerneas, and most Yveltal variants can easily revenge kill Ultra Necrozma, with Yveltal being able to revenge kill Ultra Necrozma with Sucker Punch as well. Ensure these foes are dealt with beforehand; Sticky Web prevents the former two from effectively combating Ultra Necrozma, and Stealth Rock support and offensive pressure will keep Yveltal in line.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>The best utilities Necrozma-DW can provide to its team are spinblocking and wallbreaking. Therefore, it is best fit on offensive teams, where dedicated hazard setters can set entry hazards to facilitate Necrozma-DW's sweep, while Necrozma-DW can block Rapid Spin and heavily pressure many Defog users. Sticky Web is the best hazard for Necrozma-DW, as it allows Ultra Necrozma to defeat its offensive checks like Mega Gengar and Choice Scarf Xerneas. Smeargle can set Sticky Web while potentially crippling faster threats like Yveltal and Mewtwo with Nuzzle, allowing Necrozma-DW to better deal with them.</li> <li>Cloyster, Excadrill, and Deoxys-S are also appropriate options for entry hazard setters for offensive teams. Although Necrozma-DW would generally prefer Sticky Web, the former two's Rapid Spin is always useful, and Excadrill's ability to set Stealth Rock and use Toxic on Mega Sableye is appreciated for Necrozma-DW lacking Outrage. Deoxys-S can also, depending on its moveset, set Stealth Rock against Mega Sableye and situationally provide Necrozma-DW with more preferable hazards, as it has access to both Stealth Rock and Spikes.</li> <li>Offensive teammates with Stealth Rock are needed if a Sticky Web user is employed. Both Primal Groudon and Dialga can dent problematic Steel-types with their Fire-type attacks and set Stealth Rock, which is helpful for Necrozma-DW when against Yveltal and Lugia.</li> <li>As Necrozma-DW is vulnerable to Dark- and Ghost-types, offensive checks to them are needed. Yveltal can pivot into Dark-type attacks and check Ghost-types. Depending on the variant, Yveltal can prevent Defog with Taunt or safely bring Necrozma-DW into the field with U-turn. Xerneas offensively checks Dark-types, Marshadow, and Giratina-O, and it can take advantage of Ultra Necrozma weakening Steel-types to clean up late-game. Tapu Lele offensively checks Dark-types and summons Psychic Terrain, which protects Necrozma-DW from priority moves and makes Photon Geyser immensely powerful.</li> <li>Other wallbreakers like Primal Kyogre, Rayquaza, and Marshadow can assist Necrozma-DW's sweep by hindering defensive cores.</li> </ul> "

  "Magearna": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Due to Magearna's typing in Steel / Fairy and good natural bulk, it holds a solid niche as one of the strongest counters to Xerneas, as well as a reliable switch-in to nigh-unwallable attackers such as Yveltal and Deoxys-A.</li> <li>Access to the near-exclusive Heart Swap allows Magearna to be one of the very few defensive counterplay options against Refresh Calm Mind Arceus formes.</li> <li>Its access to of Heal Bell also allows it to provide cleric support to its team.</li> <li>The pivoting move Volt Switch sets Magearna apart from most of Xerneas's answers; the likes of defensive Necrozma-DM and Chansey are vulnerable to Shadow Tag users, but Magearna can switch out against them with said move.</li> <li>Lack of access to Toxic means Magearna can do very little to its common switch-ins and counters.</li> <li>Magearna is rather dependent on its resistance to attacks to function as a wall, and this leaves it vulnerable to wallbreakers such as Primal Kyogre and Mega Lucario. While it has only two weaknesses in Ground and Fire, they are very common, and this makes Magearna quite easy to force out.</li> <li>Ground-types in particular block Volt Switch, making Magearna a momentum drain rather than a momentum generator in many occasions.</li> <li>As a counter to Xerneas, Magearna faces competition from Necrozma-DM, which has much more of an offensive presence, access to Toxic to punish its switch-ins, and the ability to set Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Lastly, the omnipresence of Primal Groudon as the single best forme of Pokemon in the tier is detrimental to Magearna's viability. Most of the time, said threat switches into Magearna with impunity thanks to its resistance to Fleur Cannon and immunity to Volt Switch, causing a loss of momentum as Magearna is forced out.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Magearna is a one-dimensional Pokémon due to its inability to employ offensive sets and get them to function well in practice with its low Speed tier despite the many coverage and utility moves available.</li> <li>Magearna can attempt to justify a Choice Specs set with offensive investment. While this set lacks the durability of specially defensive sets, it can justify some coverage moves and punish many foes that are caught off guard. Moves like Grass Knot can catch Ground-types with varying damage, having a chance to OHKO Arceus-Ground after Stealth Rock damage. Fleur Cannon also becomes much harder to manage for offensive Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM. However, more teams value the defensive utility that Magearna can generally provide with more bulk investment.</li> <li>Flash Cannon may be an appealing STAB move due to its ability to hit Fairy-types, but this forgoes the ability to dent Dragon- and Fighting-types and turns Magearna into setup fodder against the significant portion of the metagame. In addition, a Fairy Aura-boosted Fleur Cannon already OHKOes Xerneas after Magearna steals its Geomancy boosts with Heart Swap, and for this reason, Flash Cannon can't be justified over Fleur Cannon.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types</strong>: The presence of Ground-types is simply a bane to Magearna's effectiveness. Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground can switch into Magearna and easily take away momentum with impunity thanks to the former's resistance to Fleur Cannon and the latter's access to Recover. A single misplay from Magearna against Dugtrio leads it to getting trapped and falling prey to Tectonic Rage.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Ho-Oh takes next to no damage from any attack from Magearna thanks to its massive Special Defense stat and Regenerator, which allow it to shrug off even a super effective Volt Switch. While Mega Blaziken struggles to take Fleur Cannon, it easily OHKOes Magearna with Flare Blitz or sets up Swords Dance on the forced switch and proceeds to rampage through Magearna's team if checks are insufficient.</p> <p><strong>Coverage Moves: Support Arceus formes, especially the offensive variants with Calm Mind, tend to run Earth Power or Fire Blast as a coverage move, which does a chunk of damage to Magearna. Fire-type coverage moves from Yveltal, Mega Mewtwo Y, and Naganadel can 2HKO Magearna. Earthquake is commonly employed by physical attackers such as Mega Salamence, Ultra Necrozma, and Rayquaza that would otherwise have a hard time against Steel-types.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Although they do not like losing momentum by switching into Volt Switch, Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn are persistent switch-ins to Magearna due to their resistance to Fleur Cannon, good bulk, and access to recovery options. Offensive variants of Necrozma-DM can either set up or do heavy damage to Magearna with any attack it commonly carries, while defensive ones can freely set up Stealth Rock and don't mind chip damage thanks to their access to recovery. Ferrothorn uses Magearna as a fodder for setting up Spikes, an entry hazard that significantly reduces Magearna's longevity.</p> <p><strong>Physical Attackers: Due to the fact that Magearna is mandated to run a specially defensive spread to fulfill its role and is dependent on its resistances to switch into threats it is supposed to handle, powerful physical attackers such as Marshadow, Mega Lucario, and Swords Dance Arceus formes can easily pressure or weaken it. Most of them do not like directly switching into Fleur Cannon, however.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Heart Swap removes boosts from sweepers such as Geomancy Xerneas and Calm Mind Arceus formes, rendering them powerless.</li> <li>Fleur Cannon is a STAB move that is used to wear down Primal Groudon as well as OHKOing common threats like Mega Salamence and Marshadow while heavily damaging Mega Lucario and Giratina.</li> <li>Volt Switch allows Magearna to generate momentum against non-Ground-types and lets it escape from Shadow Tag users such as Mega Gengar and Gothitelle.</li> <li>Heal Bell is used to provide valuable cleric support and is a key aspect to the utility Magearna provides to a team. As one of the only clerics that can fit offensive teams, Magearna can take advantage of the Pokemon it checks to use Heal Bell and clear status from its teammates.</li> <li>Pain Split helps Magearna stay healthy when combined with Leftovers recovery by taking advantage of bulky foes like Ho-Oh, Chansey, and support Arceus formes.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>A fully specially defensive EV spread maximizes Magearna's bulk to sponge hits from Xerneas, Yveltal, and Deoxys-A. It also provides Magearna with a chance to escape an OHKO from Naganadel's +2 Fire Blast most of the time from full HP and retaliate with Fleur Cannon.</li> <li>Leftovers prevents Magearna from being worn down too quickly by providing it with a passive recovery.</li> <li>When using Heal Bell, forgoing Leftovers and running Normalium Z lets Magearna fully restore its health using Z-Heal Bell, but the lack of Leftovers means that Magearna will be worn down much more easily with residual damage, and therefore this option wouldn't have significant improvement on longevity other than letting Magearna recover in a pinch.</li> <li>Soul-Heart is Magearna's only available ability, which has the situational use of increasing its Special Attack whenever a foe faints.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Magearna should be switched into threats it walls, with the most common ones being Xerneas, Yveltal, Deoxys-A, and support Arceus formes, to absorb damage that its teammates would otherwise have a hard time handling.</li> <li>It is worth noting that Magearna can make a use of its Steel typing to switch into the majority of the support Arceus formes and passive foes like Lugia and Chansey to absorb Toxic.</li> <li>Due to Magearna's predictable and passive moveset, the opposing team will almost always switch into threats like Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Ho-Oh that do not mind any attacking moves from Magearna and will offensively force it out. The former one especially blocks Volt Switch, so one should consider double switching before mindlessly pressing it with Magearna. If there is a risk involved in double switching, it is better to simply use Fleur Cannon or Heal Bell and switch out afterwards.</li> <li>Especially if one's team is reliant on Magearna as a check to Xerneas, Dugtrio should be avoided by any means necessary; although it is OHKOed by Fleur Cannon on switch, it can trap Magearna by switching in on a predicted Volt Switch or simply double switching in and proceeding to OHKO Magearna next turn.</li> <li>Although Magearna is good at taking special attacks, it is always beneficial to scout for unexpected coverage moves such as Fire Blast and Earth Power from Arceus formes and Heat Wave from Yveltal, as these will heavily damage Magearna, which is detrimental due to its lack of reliable recovery. Especially in the case of Calm Mind Arceus formes, they will aim to lure in Magearna and wear it down with their coverage moves to put it in a range of boosted attacks. Xerneas is inclined to wear down Magearna with multiple use of Hidden Power Ground or Hidden Power Fire, which are quite weak without Geomancy boosts but are going to put Magearna into range of a boosted attack later in the match.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Magearna secures its spot in many archetypes thanks to the role compression it offers as a check to dangerous special attackers, switch-in to Toxic, and cleric.</li> <li>Zygarde-C is one of the best partners for Magearna to form a defensive core with; it switches into Fire-types for Magearna and is a very strong check to Primal Groudon and essentially is a blanket check to most physical attackers in the tier that overpower Magearna. Magearna in return switches into Fairy- and Dragon-type attacks as well as Ice Beam from support Arceus formes. If successfully used, Volt Switch also brings in Zygarde-C safely, making Zygarde's Power Construct safer and easier to activate.</li> <li>Support Arceus formes are alternative ways to check Primal Groudon; Arceus-Ground offensively handles Primal Groudon while it can set up Stealth Rock to ensure Ho-Oh is harshly punished every time it switches into Magearna. Arceus-Water is a more reliable switch-in to Primal Groudon defensively and uses Defog to remove Spikes from the field, which is one of the most detrimental factors to Magearna's longevity.</li> <li>Mega Salamence is a solid check to Primal Groudon and appreciates Magearna acting as an effective switch-in to most Arceus formes and Ice Beam while taking on most Fairy-types.</li> <li>Ho-Oh alleviates Magearna's role as a specially defensive wall thanks to Regenerator and threatens the Steel-types that switch into Magearna without much concern, as well as checking Primal Groudon sets without a Rock-type move and support variants of Arceus-Ground. It appreciates Magearna's ability to either switch into Toxic or remove such status ailments with Heal Bell.</li> <li>Primal Groudon threatens Steel-types as well and sets up Stealth Rock for the same purpose as Arceus-Ground. It can lure support Arceus formes that can persistently take hits from Magearna and cripple them with Toxic or overpower them after using Swords Dance. It can take more offensive approach against said foes thanks to Magearna's Heal Bell curing Primal Groudon of a potential Toxic.</li> <li>Mega Sableye provides entry hazard control against passive hazard setters such as Ferrothorn while acting as a solid check to Marshadow and Extreme Killer Arceus. Magearna switches into Fairy-type attacks and Calm Mind Arceus formes that overpower Mega Sableye in return.</li> <li>In order for Magearna to be the most efficient, its team must have methods to punish Ground-types switching into Magearna and blocking Volt Switch. Spikes from Ferrothorn and Klefki and Toxic Spikes from Toxapex make opponents think twice before attempting to bring such foes in to take advantage of Magearna, as the entry hazards will wear them down fast.</li> </ul> "

  "Marshadow": {
    "overview": "<ul> <li>Marshadow is an offensive powerhouse that is capable of revenge killing with ease, cleaning up weakened teams, and breaking through walls.</li> <li>Marshadow has decent Attack and a great Speed tier in base 125. These above-average offensive stats combined with Marshadow's unresisted combination of strong Ghost- and Fighting-type STAB attacks make it an all-around strong offensive Pokemon.</li> <li>Its unique typing gives a number of immunities and resistances, most notably an immunity to Extreme Speed, making it great versus offensive teams, as it cannot be revenge killed easily.</li> <li>Marshadow's great Speed tier and Technician-boosted Shadow Sneak make Marshadow great at revenge killing and cleaning up weakened teams, making it a potent anti-offense Pokemon.</li> <li>Spectral Thief's ability to steal stat boosts from foes can cause trouble for opposing setup Pokemon, especially physical ones. Additionally, it dissuades foes from trying to set up on teams with Marshadow, causing even more trouble to offense teams.</li> <li>Marshadow's access to Bulk Up and a strong Z-Move in Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike allows it to wallbreak effectively.</li> <li>Technician-boosted coverage moves like Rock Tomb and Hidden Power Ice round off Marshadow's excellent offensive movepool.</li> <li>However, Marshadow's overall damage output is not great when it is not using its Z-Move, and it relies heavily on opposing Pokemon being weakened beforehand in order to KO them.</li> <li>Unimpressive defenses make it weak to any Pokemon that it can't KO outright. For example, a healthy Primal Groudon can take any hit from Marshadow and OHKO Marshadow in return with Precipice Blades.</li> <li>Faster Pokemon and Choice Scarf users such as Xerneas and Yveltal can pose a threat to it.</li> </ul> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <ul> <li>Choice Band can provide immediate extra power without taking Life Orb damage. However, this set is easily exploitable, as Marshadow's attacks all have common checks. Becoming Choice-locked into a move that the opponent has an answer for can lead to losing massive amounts of momentum.</li> <li>Bulk Up and Poison Jab combined with Poisonium Z can be used to break through Fairy-type checks.</li> <li>Choice Scarf can surprise opponents by stealing boosts from Speed-boosted Pokemon like Mega Salamence, Rock Polish Primal Groudon, and Geomancy Xerneas, as people generally do not give the latter two Pokemon enough Speed EVs to outspeed a Pokemon as fast as Choice Scarf Marshadow. However, this has the problem of locking Marshadow into exploitable moves and also severely lacks power.</li> <li>A bulky set with Bulk Up, Substitute, and Drain Punch may potentially be able to break through bulkier teams while staying healthy. However, this set lacks any sort of offensive power without significant boosts from Bulk Up, which are generally very difficult to obtain.</li> <li>Low Kick is an alternative to Close Combat for a Fighting-type STAB attack, with the advantage of not dropping Marshadow's defenses, making it less prone to being revenge killed. Most of the Pokemon commonly used in the Ubers tier are heavy enough that they are eligible for Low Kick's maximum 120 Base Power. However, some Pokemon such as Blissey, Chansey, Mega Diancie, and Genesect are light enough to take significantly less damage, allowing them to survive what would be an OHKO from Close Combat.</li> <li>Force Palm is another alternative to Close Combat that can potentially paralyze threats, making it difficult for them to perform their roles. Furthermore, it is boosted by Technician and does not drop Marshadow's defenses. However, even after the Technician boost, it has significantly lower power than Close Combat and misses many valuable KOs that Close Combat provides, such as an OHKO on Extreme Killer Arceus and a 2HKO on 252 HP Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Swagger is an option to disrupt opposing teams, as the threat of Spectral Thief stealing the +2 Attack boost can easily force out afflicted foes. This is especially true for weaker special attackers, which cannot make use of the Attack boost. The possibility of self-inflicting damage through confusion combined with the increased Attack stat further incentivizes opposing Pokemon to switch out. These forced switches can rack up entry hazard damage and potentially provide opportunities for Marshadow to set up a Substitute or Bulk Up.</li> <li>Other Hidden Power attacks can be used for coverage on problematic Pokemon, such as Hidden Power Flying for Buzzwole, which can comfortably survive Marshadow's other attacks and recover its health with Roost.</li> </ul> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types</strong>: Defensive Fairy-types like Arceus-Fairy and Xerneas can only be OHKOed by a boosted Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike. Otherwise, they easily survive any attack and OHKO in return.</p> <p><strong>Support Arceus Formes: Defensive Arceus formes like Arceus-Water and Arceus-Ground can survive two Close Combats from Marshadow and in turn take it down with a combination of Toxic and Recover or a Judgment on a Marshadow weakened by Close Combat drops. However, because Marshadow outspeeds them, they must be in healthy condition in order to safely come in on Marshadow.</p> <p><strong>Yveltal: When given a free switch, Yveltal can easily threaten Marshadow while surviving any of Marshadow's unboosted attacks. Yveltal can, in turn, OHKO with Oblivion Wing or threaten to revenge kill a weakened Marshadow with Sucker Punch. Choice Scarf Yveltal easily outspeeds Marshadow and OHKOes it with Oblivion Wing. Defensive Yveltal sets can survive two Close Combats without Stealth Rock, even with the Life Orb boost. It can then heal off the damage with Roost and hit back with a Dark Aura-boosted Foul Play, which OHKOes Marshadow after just one Defense drop from Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde-C</strong>: Without Hidden Power Ice, Marshadow struggles greatly to break through Zygarde-C, as it fails to 4HKO a healthy Zygarde-C without boosts. Bulk Up sets require many boosts to be able to OHKO or even 2HKO it.</p> <p><strong>Mega Salamence</strong>: The combination of Intimidate in its base forme, good defenses in its Mega-evolved forme, access to Dragon Dance, and the ability to OHKO Marshadow with any Aerilate-boosted attack means Mega Salamence is very threatening to Marshadow. Mega Salamence can even take a hit from Marshadow if Marshadow does not have Hidden Power Ice or Rock Tomb, set up Dragon Dance, and OHKO Marshadow, while Marshadow never has the opportunity to steal the boosts.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users</strong>: Choice Scarf users that don't mind Shadow Sneak, like Xerneas and Yveltal, outspeed Marshadow and easily OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: If Stealth Rock is not set on Ho-Oh's side of the field, Ho-Oh easily survives any unboosted attack from Marshadow except Rock Tomb. Defensive sets can potentially even survive a boosted Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike. In return, Ho-Oh can outright OHKO Marshadow with Brave Bird, replenish its health with Roost, Recover, or Regenerator, or cripple Marshadow with a Sacred Fire burn.</p> <p><strong>Priority</strong>: Although Marshadow is immune to Extreme Speed, there are many other common forms of priority that threaten it. Bullet Punch from Mega Lucario and Mega Scizor and Sucker Punch from Yveltal can KO a Marshadow that is weakened or has had its defenses lowered by Close Combat.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon: Primal Groudon's strong defensive stats allow even offensive sets to easily survive any unboosted attack from Marshadow. In return, it can OHKO with many of its attacks, set up Stealth Rock, or even set up stat boosts of its own. However, it cannot switch in on Marshadow's Life Orb-boosted Close Combat if Stealth Rock is up. Furthermore, due to its lack of reliable recovery, Primal Groudon can be worn down over time.</p> <p><strong>Toxapex</strong>: Toxapex easily survives any unboosted hit from Marshadow while using Recover and Regenerator to remain healthy. If Marshadow has Bulk Up, Toxapex can nullify any boosts with Haze. However, if Marshadow finds an opportunity to use Bulk Up, it can OHKO Toxapex with a boosted Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike.</p> <p><strong>Landorus-T</strong>: Intimidate lessens Marshadow's offensive presence, and Landorus-T can be problematic if Marshadow does not carry Hidden Power Ice. Landorus-T can then freely set up Stealth Rock or use U-turn to gain momentum.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye</strong>: Mega Sableye can survive any hit bar a boosted Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike, and recover the damage. In return, it can cripple Marshadow with Will-O-Wisp or wear it down with a combination of Toxic and Foul Play.</p> <p><strong>Ultra Necrozma</strong>: Ultra Necrozma avoids an OHKO from Shadow Sneak, even with its reduced defenses in comparison to its Dusk Mane and Dawn Wings formes. In return, it outspeeds and OHKOes Marshadow with ease.</p> ",

Otherwise, Marshadow struggles to avoid being revenge killed by Pokemon that can survive its attacks.</li> <li>This is especially true when opposing Pokemon like Arceus-Fairy and Toxapex are still healthy — they can come in to easily take hits while wearing down Marshadow through Life Orb damage and robbing your team of any momentum.</li> <li>Marshadow's immunities can provide opportunities for it to come in on a predicted Normal- or Fighting-type attack. However, this should be done cautiously, as Marshadow's lack of bulk means it can fall easily to mispredictions.

Some teammates that can set and control hazards include Excadrill, Cloyster, and Deoxys-S. Excadrill and Cloyster can clear hazards via Rapid Spin, while Deoxys-S can prevent these hazards from being set up in the first place via an extremely fast Taunt. Bulkier teams may find Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM, Primal Groudon, and Ferrothorn more suitable, as they have the longevity to come in repeatedly to set up hazards over the course of the game.</li> <li>Pokemon with access to U-turn, such as Yveltal, can help safely bring in Marshadow.</li> <li>Partners that can beat bulky Fairy-types like Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy, such as Necrozma-DM and Primal Groudon, can help clear a path for Marshadow to finish the game.</li> <li>Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre can break other defensive Pokemon that Marshadow might not have the coverage for such as Toxapex, Zygarde-C, and Ho-Oh. Primal Groudon can easily break through Toxapex and Ho-Oh, while Primal Kyogre can break through all three, provided it carries Thunder for Toxapex.</li> <li>Mega Gengar and Gothitelle can trap and remove checks such as Arceus-Fairy and Toxapex. However, these two Pokemon share common weaknesses with Marshadow.</li> <li>Special wallbreakers especially complement Marshadow, as defensive Pokemon can rarely survive the onslaught of both strong physical and special attacks.</li> <li>On less offensive teams, Magearna is a strong partner, as it can easily come in on Yveltal and Xerneas. In addition, Magearna has access to a relatively slow Volt Switch, allowing for more opportunities to safely bring in Marshadow and maintain momentum.</li> <li>Using Sticky Web is an option that allows Marshadow to beat Choice Scarf users, although it fails to affect Choice Scarf Yveltal, one of Marshadow's greatest threats.</li> </ul> "

        "name": "Bulk Up",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <ul> <li>Bulk Up provides the extra damage Marshadow needs to break through Pokemon that would normally check it.</li> <li>Close Combat and Spectral Thief are Marshadow's preferred STAB attacks.</li> <li>Spectral Thief also goes through Substitute, allowing Marshadow to steal stats from Pokemon that try to set up behind a Substitute.</li> <li>Spectral Thief also lets Marshadow use the Z-Move Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike, which further boosts its wallbreaking capabilities, especially in combination with a Bulk Up boost. After a single Bulk Up, Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike can OHKO many of Marshadow's checks, such as support Arceus formes that don't resist it like as Arceus-Fairy, -Ground, and -Water after Stealth Rock, Toxapex after Stealth Rock damage, offensive or weakened defensive Ho-Oh, and more.</li> <li>Shadow Sneak can revenge kill or finish off severely weakened threats.</li> <li>Substitute takes advantage of the many switches that Marshadow forces and allows Marshadow to more safely set up while being protected from things like status and Dragon Tail phazing, which is especially helpful versus defensive teams. Despite Marshadow's mediocre defenses, its Substitute can survive some weak attacks from defensive Pokemon, such as Ice Beam from Lugia.</li> <li>Rock Tomb is a potential option over Substitute or Shadow Sneak, as it provides Marshadow with an extra way to beat defensive Ho-Oh, which can survive a boosted Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike. Hidden Power Ice can be used for Mega Salamence and Zygarde but is fairly weak and fails to OHKO both.</li> </ul> <h1>Set Details</h1> <ul> <li>Even with Substitute, Attack and Speed are maximized to optimize offensive capability. Investment in bulk does not affect Marshadow's defensive capabilities significantly.</li> <li>A Jolly Nature allows Marshadow to outspeed fast defensive Pokemon such as maximum Speed Timid Arceus formes and Speed tie with other Marshadow.</li> <li>Marshadium Z gives Marshadow access to Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike.</li> </ul> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <ul> <li>Marshadow can be used early-game to break through walls for the rest of your team or late-game to clean up a weakened team.</li> <li>Take advantage of the many switches that Marshadow forces by setting up either Substitute or Bulk Up.</li> <li>However, be cautious about using Bulk Up, as Marshadow is quite frail even with the boost in Defense and can still be crippled by status such as paralysis or burn.</li> <li>Take care in using Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike, as Marshadow's other attacks are relatively weak, especially without Bulk Up boosts. Opponents may try to predict the Z-Move by switching into Normal- or Dark-types, which Marshadow can punish with Close Combat.</li> <li>Be cautious of faster Pokemon or Speed-boosting sweepers; the diminished power from not having a Life Orb means Marshadow struggles to revenge kill with Shadow Sneak. In particular, Shadow Sneak now misses the OHKO on Gengar without Stealth Rock. Close Combat also cannot KO Arceus and Arceus-Dark with HP investment, even after Stealth Rock.</li> <li>Substitute can be used to deter foes from setting up Dragon Dance or punish greedy Pokemon like Mega Salamence and Rayquaza that may try to set up with Dragon Dance. After Dragon Dance, opposing Pokemon become faster than Marshadow, and Marshadow can steal their stat boosts while they break the Substitute.</li> <li>With Substitute, Marshadow can set up extra boosts on Zygarde-C in an attempt to break through it, even without Hidden Power Ice. By correctly predicting Rest, Glare, or Toxic, Marshadow can set up a Substitute for free and begin boosting. At +1 Defense, Dragon Tail fails to break the Substitute, while Thousand Arrows fails to break the Substitute a small percentage of the time. At +2 Defense, Thousand Arrows will also require two hits to break the Substitute. However, Zygarde-C's monstrous bulk means that Marshadow will require at least 5 boosts in order to always OHKO it with Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike. As such, it is generally a good idea to keep Zygarde in its regular forme before attacking it with a boosted hit, doing some damage beforehand without crossing the 50% HP threshold. In this case, you will require much less damage to KO it. For example, +1 Close Combat will almost always keep Zygarde above 50% HP after Stealth Rock damage and Leftovers recovery. Marshadow can then finish off Zygarde with Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike.</li> <li>If you have not yet attacked, you can bluff a Life Orb set to threaten out Pokemon that may be concerned about falling to coverage moves such as Ho-Oh and Mega Salamence. Marshadow can then take advantage of the switch by setting up Substitute or Bulk Up, and then potentially break through the check that the opponent has sent in with a boosted Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike.</li> </ul> <h1>Team Options</h1> <ul> <li>Stealth Rock support is crucial for extra chip damage, which allows Marshadow to KO Pokemon such as support Arceus with a boosted Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike. Even then, support Arceus formes with some Defense investment can survive a small percentage of the time, so Spikes support from Pokemon such as Cloyster, Deoxys-S, and Ferrothorn may also be helpful.</li> <li>Setup sweepers like Geomancy Xerneas and Dragon Dance Salamence pair nicely with this set, as Marshadow can break through many of their checks, such as special walls and Steel-types like Necrozma-DM.</li> <li>Pokemon that can beat Mega Salamence and Choice Scarf Yveltal are greatly appreciated, especially as this set generally does not run coverage. Furthermore, the Intimidate Attack drop from Salamence can be problematic. Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy can generally handle Yveltal and Mega Salamence offensively, as they can OHKO both of these threats with their STAB attacks. More defensive options include support Arceus formes like Arceus-Water and Arceus-Ground, which have no trouble taking hits from these Pokemon and can fire back with either Ice Beam or Toxic to wear them down.</li> <li>Ho-Oh checks are also very helpful for Marshadow, as Marshadow struggles to break through it without the use of a boosted Z-move. Ho-Oh can be dealt with using defensive checks such as Zygarde-C and support Arceus formes, and its 4x weakness to Rock can be exploited by offensive checks such as Primal Groudon.</li> <li>Although it is possible for Marshadow to beat Zygarde-C, it relies heavily on correct predictions and may not work some of the time. Therefore, it may be necessary to send in another Pokemon that can break Zygarde-C, such as Xerneas, Arceus-Fairy, or a Pokemon running Ice Beam.</li> </ul> "
