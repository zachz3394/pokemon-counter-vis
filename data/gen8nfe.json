While weaker, Giga Drain lets Ivysaur retain its bulk while sweeping, making it less likely to be revenge killed by Ice Shard Piloswine. Giga Drain is also able to be used after sun turns are over. Weather Ball gives Ivysaur a coverage move to hit Ferroseed and Klang, as well as other Steel-types for super effective damage, while also hitting Golbat for significant damage. Sludge Bomb lets Iyvsaur do substantial amounts of damage outside of sun. Sleep Powder helps Iyvsaur set up on troublesome switch-ins like Golbat, Galarian Corsola, and Rufflet, while Synthesis heals Iyvsaur, increasing its longevity without resorting to Giga Drain. The EV spread gives Iyvsaur enough speed to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame along with Choice Scarf Lampent under sun.</p> <p>Vulpix is Ivysaur's most important teammate, as it automatically sets up sun whenever it switches in. Additional sun sweepers are helpful, whether it's other Chlorophyll Pokemon such as Tangela or Fire-types like Magmar, Charmeleon, and Raboot. Ivysaur is especially vulnerable to Steel-types outside of sun, so the aforementioned Fire-types are useful for breaking past these threats. Some form of entry hazard removal is also recommended, as Ivysaur can be worn down by entry hazards rather quickly, so Hattrem or Wartortle is a good partner. Particularly, specially defensive Wartortle is a good partner, as it helps check Fire-types such as Lampent and Magmar while being able to pivot with Flip Turn. Shell Smash Wartortle with Weather Ball is a more offensive teammate option as well. Pikachu and Golbat can be troublesome to sun teams, so teammates such as Piloswine and Gabite can be useful in threatening them and providing entry hazards of their own.</p> "

Knock Off users such as Tangela and Gurdurr make for excellent partners, as they can often force the aforementioned Pokemon onto the field and remove their Eviolite with Knock Off. Similarly, Electric-types like Electabuzz and Pikachu pair nicely with Wartortle, as they can damage shared counters like Ferroseed and Roselia, and Wartortle in return pressures the Ground-types like Marshtomp that they might otherwise struggle to deal with. Wartortle is pressured by priority users, notably Pikachu and Thwackey, so Pokemon that can limit their switchin opportunities like Spikes Ferroseed and Toxic Spikes Koffing pair well with Wartortle. Golbat can repeatedly switch into Thwackey and use U-turn to give Wartortle free setup opportunities on Pokemon like Slowpoke, and is especially notable for being able to use Super Fang to put Electabuzz in range of a boosted Surf.

Knock Off users like Tangela, Mareanie, and Gurdurr also work well with Electabuzz, as they remove Eviolites from opposing walls, making it easier for Electabuzz to wallbreak. Entry hazard setters, notably Toxic Spikes setters like the aforementioned Mareanie and Koffing, work amazingly with Electabuzz and other pivots, as they can greatly take advantage of Toxic damage. Electabuzz is also easily worn down, even when carrying Eviolite, so having slow pivots like Slowpoke and Clefairy can allow it to safely switch in; furthermore, Clefairy can provide Wish support for Electabuzz and its partners to stay healthy.</p> "

Leech Seed gives Ferroseed some longevity, especially when paired with Protect, letting it become a more reliable wall to common special attackers.

Ferroseed should avoid trying to set up hazards until opposing hazard control, notably Gurdurr and Hattrem, has been removed and should instead use Leech Seed or Knock Off to cripple them. Wallbreakers such as Pikachu and Fraxure benefit greatly from Ferroseed's hazards and their utility in wearing down opposing Pokemon. Ferroseed is susceptible to being worn down due to a lack of reliable recovery, so teammates like Piloswine and Galarian Linoone are valuable in checking special attackers once Ferroseed is weakened.</p> "

While it can prevent Stealth Rock itself with Taunt, Fletchinder should further pressure setters with offensive support from Thwackey and Galarian Mr. Mime. Walls like Ferroseed, specially defensive Wartortle, and Mareanie make up for Fletchinder's Water weakness, while it in return helps wall and punish Raboot and Thwackey. Knock Off switch-ins like Tangela and Gurdurr help preserve Feltchinder's invaluable item. Fletchinder fails to reliably check Gurdurr and Piloswine, so it should enlist support of physical walls like Tangela and Clefairy. Conversely, Drakloak and Marshtomp help deal with special wallbreakers like Lampent and Electabuzz and rely on Fletchinder—especially Eviolite variants—to check Vullaby and Ferroseed. Heal Bell support from clerics like Clefairy lets Fletchinder recover from Toxic.</p> "

Skitter Smack is Charjabug's primary attack due to its ability to cripple special attackers that may switch in such as Magmar and Hattrem while also being powerful enough to 2HKO Choice Specs variants of the latter. Volt Switch lets Charjabug generate momentum and safely switch out of setup sweepers such as Combusken, Klang, and Fraxure, which all would otherwise use it as setup fodder. Lastly, Toxic allows Charjabug to cripple Defog users like Vullaby and Gurdurr in addition to opposing hazard setters like Galarian Corsola and Piloswine.

Wallbreakers like Machoke, Rufflet, and Gastly make great use of the speed control that Charjabug provides and benefit greatly from its ability to bring them in safely with a slow Volt Switch, the latter also being an offensive spinblocker. Charjabug has no reliable recovery and is very prone to being worn down, so pairing it with Wish users like Clefairy and Togetic can increase its longevity; the aforementioned Fairy-types also function as great physically defensive walls and can alleviate some pressure from Charjabug.
