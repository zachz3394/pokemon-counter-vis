  "Gengar": {
    "overview": "<p>Mega Gengar is the preeminent trapper in Anything Goes and, as such, cannot be ignored when building and playing in the metagame. Its incredible versatility and plethora of utility options give it the unique ability to support essentially all relevant sweepers in the metagame by removing their checks, such as Arceus-Fairy for Zygarde and Marshadow. Its typing and excellent base 130 Speed in tandem with its base 170 Special Attack allow it to eliminate several notable threats, such as non-Choice Scarf Mega Rayquaza, Ultra Necrozma, and Arceus formes. It also has an immunity to Extreme Speed, blocks Rapid Spin, and easily switches into Toxic-reliant walls like Lugia and Skarmory. An immediate offensive presence and a more consistent performance against offense serve to distinguish Mega Gengar from the metagame's other prominent trapper in Gothitelle. A movepool that includes a wide array of utility options allows Mega Gengar to bypass many of its would-be checks. However, its extreme fragility and lack of reliable recovery mean that Mega Gengar can sometimes find difficulty coming into play versus foes like support Arceus formes, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela, is often reliant on prediction, and is much more vulnerable to being Pursuit trapped when compared to Gothitelle. There arises a question of opportunity cost in the use of Mega Gengar, as it prevents one from using other Mega Evolutions such as Mega Rayquaza in particular, and therefore it cannot fit into every build. Lastly, Mega Gengar's prevalence in Anything Goes means that certain otherwise trappable Pokemon sometimes elect to run coverage to handle it, while defensive teams tend to equip their passive walls with Shed Shell or use Pursuit trappers to hinder its effectiveness.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Mega Gengar possesses a number of esoteric coverage options that improve its matchup against specific threats. Thunder 2HKOes Yveltal, Primal Kyogre, and Celesteela and deals heavy damage to Ho-Oh, while Hidden Power Ice KOes base forme Zygarde after Stealth Rock damage. Icy Wind is a weaker alternative to Hidden Power Ice that additionally provides speed control, which can prove useful against healthy Dragon Dance variants of Mega Rayquaza and Zygarde that try to set up on Mega Gengar. However, these options are difficult to fit. One can opt for various mono-attacking sets in conjunction with Mega Gengar's plethora of utility options aside from the mentioned Perish Song set. A set utilizing Taunt / Substitute / Destiny Bond / Shadow Ball or Sludge Bomb allows for more reliable use of Destiny Bond while maintaining Mega Gengar's general utility with Substitute. Additionally, one can opt for Disable over a coverage move; this trades coverage for the ability to remove slower mono-attackers. Toxic can be used on the status-inducing set to cripple several of Mega Gengar's common checks that are immune to or do not mind Will-O-Wisp, such as Ho-Oh. Hypnosis is yet another status-inducing option and is quite difficult to handle should it hit its targets. Its inconsistency, however, should be stressed. Reflect Type prevents Mega Gengar from being Pursuit trapped and gives it a positive matchup against Ferrothorn variants carrying Gyro Ball. Protect guarantees safe Mega Evolution against foes like Marshadow and Choice Scarf Yveltal and can be used to help stall out Perish Song turns. However, it is usually outclassed by the other mentioned utility options and is punished more by mispredictions than Substitute. Pain Split is an option for defensive teams that wish to extend Mega Gengar's longevity. Unfortunately, this move is of questionable overall value relative to Mega Gengar's other utility options. Finally, Taunt can be used over Shadow Ball or Sludge Bomb on the Perish Trapper set to make Mega Gengar an extremely potent stallbreaker, as it can even eliminate phazers like defensive Ho-Oh with proper prediction. However, this makes the set overly passive and often useless in other matchups and is therefore not generally recommended.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>As Shadow Tag allows Mega Gengar to force matchups, it in fact has no counters. Its checks are generally comprised of revenge killers and Pokemon that cannot be trapped.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats and Priority: Most of the metagame's Choice Scarf users such as Mega Rayquaza and Yveltal outspeed Mega Gengar and easily eliminate it owing to its fragility. While Mega Gengar is immune to Extreme Speed, other forms of priority, most notably from Marshadow and Yveltal, easily KO it. Mega Mewtwo Y and Deoxys-A are examples of the few viable Pokemon that naturally outspeed Mega Gengar and therefore easily eliminate it, though they do not serve as suitable switch-ins on the turn Gengar Mega Evolves. Even base forme Mewtwo can force Mega Gengar out, as the latter usually cannot afford to risk a Speed tie.</p> <p><strong>Pursuit Trappers: Pursuit users such as Tyranitar, Marshadow, Deoxys-A, and Alolan Muk can eliminate a fleeing Mega Gengar, though Mega Gengar must lack Focus Blast in Tyranitar's case. Note that Marshadow must make a risky prediction, especially if the Mega Gengar user is aware that it carries Pursuit. Additionally, Mega Gengar is capable of eliminating slower Pursuit trappers with Destiny Bond.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Offensive Threats: The likes of Primal Kyogre, Zygarde-C, Ho-Oh, and specially defensive Primal Groudon all escape the 2HKO from any of Mega Gengar's commonly seen coverage moves and easily remove it with their STAB moves. They can only be overcome by the use of Destiny Bond, boosted Hex, or, in some cases, the Perish Song set. Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Dark are also able to accomplish this but are shakier checksâ€”Mega Gengar often runs coverage specifically to handle Arceus-Dark.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon that are Immune to Shadow Tag: Ghost-types are immune to Shadow Tag, and therefore Mega Gengar proves ineffective in eliminating passive Ghost-type Pokemon such as Giratina. Defensive teams also have the option of equipping passive walls with Shed Shell in order to escape from Shadow Tag; pivoting moves such as Magearna's Volt Switch accomplish the same.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Shadow Ball eliminates Ultra Necrozma and deals significant damage to the likes of Necrozma-DM, Lugia, and Primal Groudon. Sludge Wave eliminates Fairy-types, most notably Arceus-Fairy and Xerneas, and is Mega Gengar's strongest STAB move. Taunt prevents Mega Gengar from being used as setup fodder, allows it to have a positive matchup against passive Pokemon, and prevents it from being phazed by Roar or Whirlwind from Pokemon like Lugia. It is also required to successfully eliminate the common Arceus-Poison. Substitute allows Mega Gengar to scout the opponent's initial switch-in to it on the turn it Mega Evolves and forces Choice item users to lock into a move. It also allows Mega Gengar to escape from Pursuit users, play around a weakened Yveltal's Sucker Punch, and avoid debilitating status such as Nuzzle from Smeargle. Focus Blast removes Tyranitar and improves the matchup against Extreme Killer Arceus, Arceus-Dark, and Ferrothorn. Destiny Bond can allow for a trade with a problematic Pokemon and is generally easy to utilize owing to Mega Gengar's frailty, though the move is somewhat reliant on prediction. It is also Mega Gengar's best tool against would-be checks such as Yveltal and Primal Kyogre that it cannot otherwise threaten. Finally, it allows Mega Gengar to situationally serve as a check to certain setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Arceus formes.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed investment with a Timid nature allows Mega Gengar to outspeed Ultra Necrozma and anything slower. Maximum Special Attack investment in tandem with a potent STAB combination in Shadow Ball and Sludge Wave allows it to OHKO threats like Ultra Necrozma and unboosted Xerneas while dealing massive damage to support Arceus-Fairy. Likewise, support Tyranitar is always OHKOed by Focus Blast. Shadow Tag prevents the foe from switching out, thereby allowing for the removal of a sufficiently weakened threat.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Owing to its fragility, Mega Gengar should usually not be switched into attacks, excluding weak resisted hits like support Arceus-Fairy's Judgment and Arceus-Poison's Poison Jab. Rely on free switches, double switches, or, rarely, support from pivots such as Magearna and Yveltal to get it into play. It can also be brought in on a predicted use of Toxic from support Arceus formes or walls, but this is risky. Mega Gengar should use its positive matchup against several common support Arceus formes, most notably Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Poison, to break the defensive backbone of teams that lack other answers to threatening sweepers such as Zygarde-C and Marshadow. If using Destiny Bond, assess early-game which problematic member of the opponent's team should be removed by Destiny Bond and what can be eliminated by coverage. Try to preserve Mega Gengar to check the former, as Destiny Bond can potentially remove a threat that has a strongly positive matchup against Mega Gengar's team as a whole. Be very careful in revealing Destiny Bond and err on the side of delaying its use, as often enough, unsuspecting opponents will assume that Mega Gengar will not stay in against a check and are thus inclined to set up, set entry hazards, or use other status moves. Taunt in conjunction with Destiny Bond can remedy this, but requires a risky prediction. Use Substitute to stall out residual damage, such as from Toxic or Leech Seed, and also to rack up Life Orb recoil and Special Defense drops on Mega Rayquaza. Mega Gengar's efficacy increases dramatically upon scouting the opponent's sets. For example, while Ferrothorn is normally able to check Mega Gengar due to Gyro Ball 2HKOing it, sets that have been shown to forego this move for Grass-type coverage or otherwise can be trapped and eliminated by Focus Blast. Conversely, coverage moves such as Earth Power and Roar on support Arceus formes result in a losing matchup; be sure to have teammates that take advantage of the loss in utility that these Pokemon trade for the ability to handle Mega Gengar. For example, Earth Power variants of Arceus-Poison typically cannot fit Stealth Rock, which is advantageous for Defog users that are threatened by it such as Arceus-Fairy. It is important to be extremely cautious in the use of Mega Gengar if the opponent has a Pursuit trapper such as Tyranitar, as a single well-timed double switch can immediately result in Mega Gengar's removal. If the opponent makes a move that is seemingly a mistake against a team utilizing Mega Gengar, it is likely a lure and should not be capitalized on immediately. Substitute can be used on the turn Gengar Mega Evolves to ensure safety in such a matchup. Note that Focus Blast variants of Mega Gengar can be used effectively to lure and KO one of its common Pursuit trappers in Tyranitar.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Gengar can be tailored to support almost every sweeper in the tier depending on the team's need. Defensive Zygarde has excellent defensive synergy with Mega Gengar, providing a switch-in for the likes of Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon while appreciating the removal of Fairy-types. Mega Gengar can also handle Choice Band and mixed variants of Mega Rayquaza, which threaten to break through Zygarde. In a similar vein, Dragon Dance Zygarde appreciates the removal of its primary checks in support Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Water lacking Judgment. Taunt from Mega Gengar also enables it to set up on targets like support Arceus-Poison that would otherwise cripple it with status. Zygarde may also use Thousand Waves to trap support Arceus-Fairy on the switch, thereby allowing Mega Gengar to safely eliminate it without fearing a potential double switch. Marshadow appreciates the removal of support Arceus formes such as Arceus-Poison and Arceus-Fairy. Yveltal checks Marshadow and appreciates the removal of its Fairy-type checks, which it effectively lures. It may also provide U-turn support to safely bring Mega Gengar into play. Entry hazard setters such as Ferrothorn appreciate this set's ability to prevent Defog via Taunt and its good matchup against several common Defoggers such as support Arceus formes. Ferrothorn and Celesteela can also situationally provide Leech Seed support for Mega Gengar, thereby allowing it to stall out certain threats such as Calm Mind Arceus formes in conjunction with Taunt and Substitute. Arceus-Fairy and Xerneas can check problematic Pokemon such as Yveltal, Arceus-Dark, and Marshadow for Mega Gengar. Geomancy Xerneas also appreciates one of its common checks in Arceus-Poison being disposed of. Mega Gengar can also lure and use Taunt on Arceus-Dark, thereby allowing Xerneas to set up on it without fear of Toxic or Perish Song. Ho-Oh walls support Arceus-Ground and Calm Mind Arceus-Steel, both of which are difficult for Mega Gengar to take on.</p> "

        "name": "Status Inducer",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Hex doubles in Base Power against statused foes and is capable of 2HKOing statused support Arceus formes, Ferrothorn, and offensive Zygarde-C. It should be noted that unboosted Hex falls short of an OHKO on Ultra Necrozma. Sludge Bomb complements Hex well with a significant chance to poison foes while maintaining Mega Gengar's ability to remove Fairy-types and deal greater damage to unstatused foes. Will-O-Wisp cripples prominent physical attackers and gives Mega Gengar a reliable method to boost the power of Hex. It also allows for the removal of Arceus-Poison and specially defensive Necrozma-DM, both of which are 2HKOed by boosted Hex and can't OHKO Mega Gengar once burned. Taunt shuts down passive Pokemon and is particularly useful against clerics such as Blissey. Substitute, in addition to its usual roles of helping Mega Gengar scout switch-ins and avoid Pursuit trapping, allows it to capitalize on status support such as free turns created by full paralysis.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment are required to make full use of Mega Gengar's offensive potential. Shadow Tag prevents the foe from switching out, thereby allowing for the removal of a sufficiently weakened threat.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Sludge Bomb can be used in an attempt to poison foes like Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Zygarde-C in situations where this is safe, such as when Mega Gengar is behind a Substitute. Mega Gengar's teammates should aggressively inflict status on enemy Pokemon to allow for liberal use of boosted Hex. Specific support Arceus formes such as Arceus-Poison and Arceus-Water are prime targets for this set and are easily eliminated upon being statused. Besides directly boosting the power of Hex, Will-O-Wisp significantly reduces the damage Mega Gengar takes from some weaker physical hits, allowing it to stay in on certain threats it would otherwise be unable to handle. These hits include support Necrozma-DM's Sunsteel Strike and Ferrothorn's Power Whipâ€”the latter move will not break Mega Gengar's Substitute after a burn. While this Mega Gengar variant has room to play more aggressively with attempting to directly trap support Necrozma-DM, one should be careful of Earthquake in this specific matchup. One can also pivot Mega Gengar into foes that utilize Rest for recovery, notably Zygarde-C and Primal Kyogre, and inflict massive damage with Hex. In certain matchups, Will-O-Wisp can be used to attempt to burn Pursuit trappers on the switch when Gengar Mega Evolves.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Defensive Zygarde is a premier partner for Mega Gengar; it spreads status of its own via Glare or Toxic, thus boosting the power of Hex, and appreciates the removal of Arceus-Fairy and Xerneas. In return, Mega Gengar appreciates a switch-in for the likes of Primal Groudon and Marshadow. Dragon Dance Zygarde can paralyze foes as well and finds it easier to set up on targets that have been burned or otherwise crippled. Similarly, Ho-Oh has a significant chance to inflict burns through Sacred Fire and walls support Arceus-Ground and Calm Mind Arceus-Steel, which are otherwise able to eliminate Mega Gengar if unstatused. Marshadow appreciates the removal of its common checks in Arceus-Poison and Arceus-Fairy. The Marshadium Z set may also find additional setup opportunities on targets that have been burned by Will-O-Wisp. Geomancy Xerneas is another example of a sweeper for which Will-O-Wisp support can possibly provide a more favorable setup condition. Mega Gengar is also capable of outright eliminating some of the common checks to Xerneas, namely Arceus-Poison and support Necrozma-DM. Spikes support from the likes of Ferrothorn and Skarmory in conjunction with potential Sludge Bomb poisoning can accumulate considerable chip damage on foes. Likewise, Stealth Rock support from Primal Groudon and Arceus formes inflicts significant damage to Yveltal that attempt to revenge kill Mega Gengar. Miscellaneous status users such as various support Arceus formes and support Primal Groudon prove useful in supporting this Mega Gengar variant as well. The latter is also capable of checking boosted Xerneas and Primal Kyogre, both of which can break through Mega Gengar. Offensive Primal Groudon variants can lure in support Arceus-Water for Mega Gengar as well.</p> "

        "name": "Perish Trapper",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Perish Song synergizes with Shadow Tag to guarantee the removal of a passive foe. It can also put problematic sweepers or the last member of a team on a timer, preventing them from otherwise winning in some instances. Substitute helps stall for Perish Song turns and shields Mega Gengar from status. It can also be used to waste a predicted Z-Move. Disable prevents the foe from accessing its most recently used move and, in conjunction with Substitute, allows Mega Gengar to easily remove slower mono-attackers such as certain support Arceus formes and Choice-locked Pokemon. It may also provide a setup opportunity for a teammate by locking a trapped foe out of a threatening move. Shadow Ball allows Mega Gengar to revenge kill certain dangerous offensive threats that are difficult to stall out with Perish Song, such as Ultra Necrozma. Sludge Bomb can be used in its place to immediately eliminate Fairy-types like Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy, preventing Defog from the latter.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed and Special Attack investment allow Mega Gengar to outspeed and nearly always OHKO Ultra Necrozma. Shadow Tag prevents the foe from switching out, thereby allowing Mega Gengar to remove threats that it can stall out for the duration of Perish Song.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>This Mega Gengar variant has the ability to easily overcome Arceus-Dark and defensive Yveltal, which are normally able to check it. When using this set, luring them in and setting a Substitute against a target typically forced out by Mega Gengar can prove effective. Note that Yveltal often carries Choice Scarf or Life Orb, which should be scouted for prior to attempting to trap it. Against slower Choice item users, use Disable immediately. Against foes that have only one way to significantly damage Mega Gengar, set a Substitute prior to the use of Disable to force the use of the appropriate move. Afterwards, it is generally safe to use Perish Song unless you suspect the foe is a Z-Move user. Note that early-game, Mega Gengar will typically want to switch out on the turn prior to the Perish Song counter expiring in order to avoid fainting. This must be done with some care, as the trapped target can cripple the switch-in with a status affliction or by other means and then freely go to a check upon fainting, leading to a massive loss in momentum. When choosing to switch Mega Gengar out on the turn the Perish Song counter reaches zero, make a careful analysis to determine whether this is in fact worthwhile, or whether trading Mega Gengar with the immediate threat instead will better preserve momentum. Take care in scouting for potential coverage options on otherwise easily trappable targets, such as Earth Power on Arceus-Poison, phazing moves on support Arceus formes and Ho-Oh, and Earthquake on Necrozma-DM. In particular, be very careful of potential Z-Move users, as Z-Moves ignore their base move being disabled. The most common targets for this set that often run a Z-Move are Arceus-Water and support Necrozma-DMâ€”telltale signs of this are Liquidation on Arceus-Water and a lack of Leftovers recovery on Necrozma-DM. These threats can be handled by setting an extra Substitute after their base attacking move has been disabled. If Mega Gengar's set has been scouted beforehand, these threats may even predict Disable and immediately use their Z-Move, so exercise caution in these situations. Additionally, this set can remove most variants of Ferrothorn, but it will likely accumulate multiple layers of entry hazards in the process, usually necessitating Defog support from a partner. One should note that the lack of Taunt on this set means that phazers like Ho-Oh, Lugia, and Skarmory cannot be stalled out with Perish Song, though the latter two take heavy damage from Shadow Ball. It is also important to keep in mind that if Disable is used prior to Perish Song, the foe will not be disabled on the last turn of the counter and can therefore proceed to hit the switch-in hard on the turn it faints.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard setters such as Primal Groudon and Ferrothorn appreciate the removal of almost every common Defogger in the tier. One of these, Arceus-Water, is often employed as the primary check to offensive Primal Groudon sets as well. The removal of Ferrothorn enables Primal Kyogre to more easily dismantle the defensive core of balance teams. Zygarde-C appreciates the elimination of its usual checks in Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Water. Ultra Necrozma benefits from the removal of its common checks in defensive Yveltal and Arceus-Dark. These particular threats are very easily lured in and KOed by Mega Gengar, leading to excellent synergy between Ultra Necrozma and this set. Offensive Lunala also appreciates the removal of these two threats as well, as they are often the primary checks to it on a typical team. This set easily eliminates Arceus-Poison and support Necrozma-DM, two common checks to Geomancy Xerneas. This aids greatly in facilitating a Xerneas sweep late-game.</p> "

  "Espeon": {
    "overview": "<p>Espeon is a staple on most Baton Pass teams because it is the only non-Mega Pokemon with both Baton Pass and Magic Bounce and the most effective Baton Pass receiver. Access to STAB-boosted Stored Power allows it to sweep teams effectively and efficiently, landing an OHKO on even the bulkiest Pokemon in the metagame with enough boosts, and a decent base Speed of 110 allows it to outspeed most of the metagame with a single Speed boost. However, Espeon should not be used on teams other than those utilizing Baton Pass; Mega Sableye would be a better option if only Magic Bounce is desired.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Espeon can be used on Extreme Evoboost teams, using Calm Mind over Dazzling Gleam and maximizing HP and Defense with a Timid nature. This is due to the nature of Extreme Evoboost teams essentially ensuring a +2 boost in everything besides accuracy and evasion, thus removing the need for Speed or Special Attack investment, as Espeon will OHKO and outspeed most threats anyway.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Mega Gengar can force Espeon out and threaten the rest of the team with Taunt, as it is usually the only team member with Magic Bounce. It also can trap Espeon with Shadow Tag and outspeed it, which results in Espeon being knocked out and possibly a loss if Espeon has no Speed or Special Defense boosts.</p> <p><strong>Yveltal</strong>: Yveltal forces Espeon to switch in to stop Taunt while threatening to OHKO it with Dark Pulse. Its dominance over Baton Pass teams can be slightly remedied by giving a Mental Herb to a team member with Substitute, providing Espeon with a safety net. Yveltal also can use Sucker Punch against Espeon, which can easily land an OHKO on Espeon if it doesn't have the proper Defense boosts.</p> <p><strong>Marshadow</strong>: Focus Sash Marshadow is deadly against Espeon, as it can steal all of its boosts with Spectral Thief. Even without Focus Sash, it can attack Espeon with a priority Shadow Sneak, which OHKOes with a Life Orb if Espeon lacks Defense boosts. If Marshadow's item has not been scouted and it is sent in against Espeon, it is usually safest to Baton Pass out to a Normal-type such as Smeargle.</p> <p><strong>Magearna: Magearna resists Stored Power and has high base Special Defense, requiring a great number of boosts, especially Special Attack, to knock it out. This, paired with its move Heart Swap, can let it steal a Espeon's boosts and allow it to reverse sweep. The presence of a Magearna on the opposing team can force a Baton Pass team to gather more boosts before going to Espeon to sweep, leaving it more vulnerable.</p> <p><strong>Ditto</strong>: Without regeneration from Ingrain and Aqua Ring or a Substitute to block Imposter, Ditto can switch into Espeon and copy all of its boosts to sweep.</p> <p><strong>Baton Pass Checks</strong>: Espeon requires significant boosts from teammates in order to be effective. Opposing Pokemon that can deter the team from gathering them include threats such as Haze Zygarde and Toxapex, Perish Song Arceus, forced switching, and Taunt, as well as those that simply hit the team incredibly hard, such as Deoxys-A, Mega Rayquaza, and Primal Kyogre.</p> ",

        "name": "Baton Pass Sweeper",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Baton Pass allows Espeon to switch in and out safely in combination with another Baton Pass user and to make use of Magic Bounce against status moves like Taunt and Roar or Whirlwind without losing stat boosts, as well as keeping stat boosts safe from Spectral Thief in case the opponent has a Focus Sash Marshadow. Stored Power is Espeon's main STAB move, which it can utilize to sweep due to its rapidly growing Base Power from all of Espeon's boosts. Dazzling Gleam is used to hit Dark-types such as Yveltal, Arceus-Dark, and Tyranitar due to their immunity to Stored Power. Substitute is useful as a safety net against priority moves while sweeping, and getting one up safely can be statistically inevitable with enough evasion boosts.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>8 HP EVs are used to allow Espeon to place four Substitutes without recovery. 208 Defense EVs are required to survive an Extreme Speed from Life Orb Adamant Arceus. 68 Special Attack EVs with a Modest nature are required to OHKO Mega Gengar with Stored Power after three boosts. These boosts will usually be in the form of Speed. The remaining EVs are invested into Speed in order to help Espeon outspeed the opposing Pokemon while sweeping without the need of excessive boosts, letting it outspeed the whole unboosted metagame except for Deoxys-S at +1. Magic Bounce is useful to bounce back various status moves, especially Taunt, Leech Seed, and Roar or Whirlwind before Ingrain is active. Shell Bell is useful to heal back damage taken from priority moves or Substitutes being hit through evasion, since Espeon will likely OHKO the foe. Leftovers may be preferable over Shell Bell if the team cannot provide enough regeneration from the likes of Aqua Ring to place more Substitutes with evasion boosts, as Shell Bell does not heal if Espeon does not attack.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Espeon, as the only Magic Bounce user on most Baton Pass teams, will need to be switched in with Baton Pass to block Taunt from Yveltal or Mega Gengar. However, both of these threats can OHKO Espeon without significant Special Defense boosts, so switching it into them should be done with care. Apart from bouncing back key status moves such as Taunt and Leech Seed, however, Espeon should not be out until it is ready to sweep. Once enough boosts to sweep have been accumulated, setting up a Substitute to shield Espeon from one hit is recommended before switching it in, but it is not required. Against a Marshadow whose item has not been scouted, Espeon should Baton Pass out to Smeargle, as one Spectral Thief from a Focus Sash Marshadow can immediately turn a won game into a loss. A Substitute should be placed before attacking if Espeon has evasion boosts but inadequate Defense boosts, as evasion boosts mean that a Substitute should be able to be laid down without getting hit after a few tries. Substitute is also a good move to use when switching in Espeon to bounce back a status move with intent to switch out to another team member. Substitute allows Espeon to be hit and switch to the correct team member according to the situation.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Espeon fits only on Baton Pass teams, as it lacks the ability to fulfill any other niche in the metagame. Scolipede is a powerful team member with access to Speed Boost, Baton Pass, and Iron Defense, allowing the team to farm Defense and Speed, giving Espeon the ability to outspeed opposing Pokemon while sweeping and have physical bulk to survive priority attacks from Arceus, Mega Rayquaza, and Marshadow. Smeargle is arguably the most popular Baton Passer due to having access to every move in the game along with Moody as an ability. Smeargle can put foes to sleep with Spore, use Ingrain to keep foes from phazing it, use Spectral Thief to steal back stats and hit Marshadow, and set up a Substitute to farm Moody boosts. Drifblim is the most viable evasion passer because of Minimize and Unburden along with its natural bulk. Evasion helps with setting up Substitutes when the Substitutes cannot survive any given move from the foe. Mr. Mime is invaluable against common methods of removing boosts. Soundproof allows it to switch into Perish Song and Roar, and its Fairy typing lets it switch into Dragon Tail. Taunt allows Mr. Mime to block opposing Taunts, Haze, and Heart Swap. Vaporeon can pass Aqua Ring for increased regeneration, which is useful while setting up Substitutes. It also has a defensively effective pure Water typing that allows it to get Defense boosts with Acid Armor more easily. Its natural bulk and low sSpeed also let it act as one of the most effective pivots on Baton Pass teams. Gliscor can farm evasion boosts with Double Team against Primal Kyogre, one of the most powerful threats to Baton Pass teams, because of its immunity to Thunder.</p> "

  "Tyranitar": {
    "overview": "<p>Tyranitar's Rock / Dark typing and stellar bulk allow it to act as one of the sturdiest Mega Rayquaza checks when holding a Shuca Berry. These attributes also allow it to check Mega Gengar, which it can also trap with Pursuit, as well as Ho-Oh, Ultra Necrozma, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Yveltal. Furthermore, Sand Stream's boost to its Special Defense allows to effectively check special attackers such as Mega Gengar, Calm Mind Ultra Necrozma, and Yveltal. Tyranitar also has solid utility moves: Pursuit guarantees damage on Mega Rayquaza and can remove Mega Gengar, Stealth Rock is a great boon for any team, and Foul Play does solid damage to almost everything Tyranitar is relied on to check. However, Tyranitar's lack of offensive presence allows a lot of Pokemon to easily wall it, including support Arceus formes, Ferrothorn, and Zygarde-C. Tyranitar's typing also leaves it vulnerable to the Ground-, Water-, Steel-, and Fighting-type moves that are carried by Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, Primal Kyogre, Necrozma-DM, and Marshadow, which are all very common. It is outsped by every Pokemon it attempts to check, so it is always forced to take damage. This is exacerbated by Tyranitar's lack of reliable recovery, forcing it to run Rest, which leaves it very vulnerable when asleep. Tyranitar can also be lured and eliminated by sets like Draco Meteor Mega Rayquaza and Focus Blast Mega Gengar.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Roar is an option in the fourth slot to phaze Vivillon as well as allowing Tyranitar to avoid becoming setup bait for Calm Mind users such as Arceus-Steel and Arceus-Fairy. It can also be an unexpected option to surprise Baton Pass teams. Low Kick provides powerful coverage against Arceus-Steel, Ferrothorn, and opposing Tyranitar and allows Tyranitar to more effectively check Arceus-Dark. Thunder Wave is an interesting option on status-heavy teams and slows down threats for teammates such as Mega Gengar and Primal Kyogre. Dragon Dance on a Mega Tyranitar set makes for a unique offensive sweeper with good coverage in Ice Punch, Crunch, and Low Kick. However, the opportunity cost of having to forgo a different Mega Evolution in Gengar or Rayquaza, which are better offensive threats, makes it generally not worth it; it also forfeits almost all defensive utility. Leftovers helps compensate for Tyranitar's lack of reliable recovery but makes it much less reliable against Mega Rayquaza. Crunch with 36 Speed EVs can better prevent Tyranitar from being trapped and PP stalled by Gothitelle. Choice Band allows Tyranitar to OHKO Ferrothorn and Arceus-Steel with Superpower and gives Tyranitar an unexpectedly good damage output while still solidly Pursuit trapping threats. It also reliably Pursuit traps Gothitelle. Lastly, Lum Berry can allow Tyranitar to more reliably Pursuit trap Will-O-Wisp or Hypnosis Mega Gengar while allowing it to get a one-time instant wake from Rest or Vivillon's Sleep Powder. While Shuca Berry is usually needed more often, Lum Berry can work on teams less concerned about Mega Rayquaza.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Zygarde-C, Primal Groudon, and Arceus-Ground can all freely switch into Tyranitar, threaten it out, and potentially use it as setup bait while forcing Tyranitar to switch out due to its inability to hit them hard. Zygarde-C can notably set up Substitutes for free as well, since Tyranitar's Foul Play never breaks its Substitute.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Tyranitar struggles to heavily damage every relevant Steel-type besides Necrozma-DM. Ferrothorn, Celesteela, Arceus-Steel, Skarmory, and even Magearna can easily switch into Tyranitar and have a free turn to set up Spikes, Stealth Rock, Leech Seed, or Calm Mind. Tyranitar cannot do meaningful damage to these foes and is thus forced out. While Necrozma-DM is hit hard by Foul Play, it outspeeds Tyranitar and can hit it with a +2 Sunsteel Strike to OHKO it.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Arceus-Fairy and Xerneas easily switch into and threaten out Tyranitar. Arceus-Fairy can set up Stealth Rock, Defog away entry hazards, or set up Calm Mind, while Xerneas can set up Geomancy for free or throw off a Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Tyranitar lets in Primal Kyogre mostly for free and allows it to fire off a hard-hitting Water-type attack. Arceus-Water also walls Tyranitar and can set up Stealth Rock or Defog away hazards.</p> <p><strong>Walls: Tyranitar is unable to touch most walls, including physically defensive Arceus-Ground, Ferrothorn, Giratina, Mega Sableye, and Chansey. Even with Toxic, most of these shrug it off or are immune to it.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types: While uncommon in Anything Goes, Fighting-types, most notably Marshadow, can OHKO Tyranitar due to its 4x weakness. Mega Mewtwo X is an uncommon Pokemon but also manages to get the job done. Fighting-type coverage on certain Pokemon such as Ultra Necrozma and Deoxys-A can also instantly KO Tyranitar.</p> <p><strong>Lures: Effective lures such as Focus Blast Mega Gengar, mixed Life Orb Draco Meteor Mega Rayquaza, and Choice Band Outrage Mega Rayquaza can deal with Tyranitar provided the former two hit.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Pursuit allows Tyranitar to trap threats it checks, most notably Mega Rayquaza and Mega Gengar. Foul Play is a strong STAB move due to the high Attack stats of most of Tyranitar's targets, including Mega Rayquaza, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Ultra Necrozma. Rest allows Tyranitar to restore HP and status ailments, enabling it to check Pokemon more than once and shrug off status from Pokemon like Mega Gengar. However, it leaves Tyranitar vulnerable to threats it's supposed to check; most notably, Mega Rayquaza can completely bypass Tyranitar when it's asleep with two Earthquakes and proceed to sweep. It also lets any Pokemon, especially wallbreakers, in for free. Rock Tomb enables Tyranitar to effectively check Ho-Oh and Yveltal, and the Speed reduction it offers allows Tyranitar's teammates to easily revenge kill the foe should Tyranitar be sacrificed. Stealth Rock is a decent option if Tyranitar's team is lacking a setter, and it can set the entry hazard up effectively thanks to its good bulk. However, Tyranitar's inability to threaten most Defoggers makes it less preferable. Toxic is an alternative option in the fourth slot that punishes many of the Pokemon Tyranitar can't do much against, such as support Arceus formes, Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and Arceus-Ground and still punishes Ho-Oh.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment with a Shuca Berry and an Impish nature allows Tyranitar to be an effective check to Dragon Dance Mega Rayquaza as well as Swords Dance Ultra Necrozma, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Ho-Oh. Shuca Berry is important to survive +1 Life Orb Mega Rayquaza's Earthquake to OHKO it with Foul Play, as well as to take Swords Dance Ultra Necrozma's and Arceus's Earthquake. Sand Stream gives Tyranitar a boost to its Special Defense, allowing it to take almost nothing from Mega Gengar and Yveltal's attacks, and does minor chip damage to most foes.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>If there is Mega Rayquaza on the opposing team, Tyranitar should be preserved to check it. Against a team with Gengar, Tyranitar should freely switch into it as it attempts to Mega Evolve to Pursuit trap it. Attempt to scout Mega Rayquaza's set if possible and avoid mindlessly switching Tyranitar into it, as switching into Earthquake consumes the Shuca Berry and allows Mega Rayquaza to KO Tyranitar with the next Earthquake, and Draco Meteor on some sets can deal massive damage. Pursuit can be used to deal over half to a -1 Defense Mega Rayquaza as it switches out, though it won't do much damage if it stays in, and Foul Play can OHKO -1 Mega Rayquaza after one round of Life Orb damage. Picking which to use depends on whether they have a solid switch-in to Tyranitar's Foul Play and if they can't risk losing Mega Rayquaza to Foul Play, in which case Pursuit is the better play. If the opposing Mega Rayquaza uses Dragon Dance as Tyranitar switches in, Foul Play is generally better because Tyranitar can still check Mega Rayquaza later, and the latter may take Stealth Rock damage upon switching in again. Tyranitar can also switch into and Pursuit trap both Swords Dance and Calm Mind Ultra Necrozma thanks to its Psychic immunity, provided it has already transformed, though Tyranitar should be wary of super effective coverage moves or Outrage from the Swords Dance set. Tyranitar should also freely switch into Yveltal and Ho-Oh to set up Stealth Rock or hit them with a Rock-type move. Use Rest when Tyranitar is low on health or statused, though be careful of leaving Tyranitar as setup bait due to the two turns Tyranitar is vulnerable.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Tyranitar can fit on bulky offense, balance, and stall teams as a Pursuit trapper for Mega Gengar and solid check to Mega Rayquaza. Teammates such as Choice Band Mega Rayquaza, Arceus-Fairy, and Chansey appreciate Tyranitar Pursuit trapping Mega Gengar, depending on the team archetype Tyranitar is on. Teammates on stall such as Arceus-Water, Lugia, Mega Sableye, and Chansey can cover Tyranitar's weaknesses to threats such as Calm Mind Arceus-Steel, Primal Groudon, and Primal Kyogre. Ho-Oh forms a good defensive core with Tyranitar on balance teams, covering both special and physical attackers such as Calm Mind Arceus formes, Xerneas, Yveltal, Necrozma-DM, and Primal Groudon. Ferrothorn can set Spikes for balance teams and can switch into Primal Kyogre, which Tyranitar often lets in freely. Arceus-Grass can also check Primal Kyogre as well as Arceus-Ground and appreciates Tyranitar switching into Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Mega Rayquaza. A secondary Mega Rayquaza check such as Arceus-Fairy or Lugia can cover sets Tyranitar falls victim to, most notably mixed Life Orb Mega Rayquaza. Lastly, offensive teammates such as Yveltal, Primal Groudon, and Primal Kyogre appreciate a switch-in to Mega Rayquaza and can defeat Pokemon Tyranitar struggles with.</p> "

  "Ho-Oh": {
    "overview": "<p>Ho-Oh is a unique Pokemon in the Anything Goes metagame whose versatility lets it perform a variety of different roles. It can function as a wall, a wallbreaker, or a revenge killer depending on the needs of its team. Its unique typing and natural bulk let it check some major offensive threats, including Xerneas, Necrozma-DM, and most Calm Mind Arceus formes. It also shuts down many defensive Pokemon such as support Arceus formes, Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Celesteela, and defensive Primal Groudon, being able to remove entry hazards versus them. Regenerator makes Ho-Oh incredibly hard to wear down without Stealth Rock support or great offensive pressure, meaning defensive teams that rely on indirect damage to pressure foes often struggle to break past it. Ho-Oh's STAB combination paired with Toxic also makes it very difficult to safely switch into, especially if it's running an offensive set, outside of a few select walls such as Zygarde-C. However, Ho-Oh has a crippling 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, so teams that include it usually need to provide strong anti-hazard support. It's easily overpowered by common offensive threats like Mega Rayquaza, Primal Kyogre, and Ultra Necrozma. Ho-Oh also has a poor matchup against the ubiquitous Zygarde-C; defensive sets can sponge Ho-Oh's attacks indefinitely, while Dragon Dance sets can use it as setup fodder.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A bulky Curse + Recover set with Leftovers or Flyinium Z is a decent option to set up on passive foes, but Ho-Oh will need many boosts before it's able to break through defensive Arceus formes and will usually be forced out by Toxic damage before it can attain them. Safety Goggles can be run on the defensive set and Sleep Talk can be run on offensive sets, allowing Ho-Oh to deal with sleep inducers like Vivillon and Smeargle more reliably.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Ho-Oh has a crippling 4x weakness to Stealth Rock, so its ability to check threats is greatly compromised if the entry hazard is set on its side of the field. Although Ho-Oh has a favorable matchup against most entry hazard setters, some, like Primal Groudon with a Rock-type move, Arceus-Rock, Deoxys-S, and Excadrill, can keep Stealth Rock up against it.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde-C: Defensive Zygarde-C sponges even Choice Band-boosted attacks from Ho-Oh well and can shrug off any status it inflicts with Rest. Although it does not resist Flying, it lacks a weakness to any of Ho-Oh's coverage options, making it very difficult for Ho-Oh to break past. Dragon Dance Zygarde-C does not appreciate attacks from offensive sets, Toxic poison, or Sacred Fire burns; however, once safely in, it can set up a Substitute that defensive Ho-Oh is unable to break and use Dragon Tail before Ho-Oh can phaze it with Whirlwind.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types</strong>: Tyranitar and Arceus-Rock resist Ho-Oh's STAB combination. Support Tyranitar also commonly holds Shuca Berry, letting it take any two hits from even Choice Band Ho-Oh and retaliate with Rock Tomb. It can additionally use Rest to remove any status Ho-Oh inflicts. Arceus-Rock can OHKO Ho-Oh with Judgment and heal off status it inflicts with Refresh, but it's hit hard by Earthquake, and variants that lack Refresh are annoyed by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre: Offensive Primal Kyogre sets can easily OHKO Ho-Oh with a Water-type move. Defensive variants completely wall defensive Ho-Oh, as they are immune to Fire and can cure themselves of status using Rest. However, Primal Kyogre should be wary of trying to switch in; offensive sets don't appreciate getting poisoned, and neither variant takes Brave Bird from offensive Ho-Oh well.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Water</strong>: Arceus-Water resists Fire and can force out Ho-Oh with Judgment or Liquidation. However, if it lacks a Water-type move, it struggles to meaningfully punish Ho-Oh outside of Toxic and can be pressured by Toxic damage and repeated uses of Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Giratina</strong>: Giratina's massive bulk lets it take two hits from even Choice Band Ho-Oh, and it can use Rest to heal off any status Ho-Oh inflicts. However, it can't punish Ho-Oh with much besides Toxic, which Ho-Oh doesn't mind too much thanks to Regenerator, and Brave Bird from Choice Band sets outdamages Rest in the long run.</p> <p><strong>Rock-type Coverage</strong>: Various Pokemon sometimes carry Rock-type coverage in order to hit Ho-Oh, including Primal Groudon with Stone Edge or Rock Tomb, Ultra Necrozma with Rock Blast or Power Gem, and Marshadow with Rock Tomb.</p> <p><strong>Strong Offensive Pressure: Pokemon like Mega Rayquaza, Ultra Necrozma, and Swords Dance Arceus formes can overwhelm Ho-Oh with their strong neutral attacks, especially if Ho-Oh is an offensive variant. Ultra Necrozma in particular is a foe to be wary of, since it can bait in Ho-Oh while it's in its Dusk Mane forme.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Sacred Fire lets Ho-Oh pressure Steel-types like Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn. Its high burn rate is useful to discourage physical attackers like Mega Rayquaza and Dragon Dance Zygarde-C from freely switching into Ho-Oh. Flamethrower has significantly more PP than Sacred Fire. This allows Ho-Oh to be less mindful of wasting PP against the likes of Protect Ferrothorn in longer games. Additionally, it reduces the chance of Ho-Oh accidentally burning foes like support Arceus formes that it would prefer to inflict with Toxic. However, it has very low damage output against Necrozma-DM, so Sacred Fire is generally preferred. Toxic puts pressure on support Arceus formes, ensuring they cannot stay in against Ho-Oh and continue setting Stealth Rock against it or attempt to Toxic stall it themselves. It also punishes Pokemon like Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre that may switch in expecting a Fire-type move. Ho-Oh is a great Defogger because of its favorable matchup against many of the tier's entry hazard setters, including defensive variants of Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and most support Arceus formes. Whirlwind phazes setup sweepers like Mega Rayquaza, Xerneas, Calm Mind Arceus formes, and Vivillon, preventing them from using Ho-Oh as setup fodder. Brave Bird gives Ho-Oh an offensive option against Pokemon like Mega Rayquaza, Primal Kyogre, and Naganadel. Recover reduces Ho-Oh's dependency on Regenerator and can come in handy to offset residual damage from the likes of Stealth Rock or Toxic poison.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>52 Special Defense EVs alongside maximum HP investment allow Ho-Oh to survive +2 Thunder from Geomancy Xerneas. 252, as opposed to 248, HP EVs are used to maximize the amount of Leftovers recovery that Ho-Oh receives each turn, which also negates the increased Stealth Rock damage. The rest of the EVs are put into Defense alongside a Relaxed nature, allowing Ho-Oh to survive two Spectral Thiefs from Life Orb Marshadow, +2 Searing Sunraze Smash from Necrozma-DM, and any unboosted hit from Mega Rayquaza. A Relaxed nature and 0 Speed IVs ensure that Ho-Oh uses Defog last against foes like defensive Primal Groudon. In a scenario where both sides have traded Toxic, Ho-Oh will ultimately clear any entry hazards set by a faster foe before one side faints. Leftovers grants Ho-Oh passive recovery each turn, helping it to offset damage from strong attacks without being overly reliant on Regenerator.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Defensive Ho-Oh should generally switch into Pokemon that it walls, such as support Arceus formes, passive Steel-types, and defensive Primal Groudon, and remove the entry hazards they set or use the opportunity to spread status. Ho-Oh can liberally switch into defensive Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Celesteela that rely on status moves to punish their foes. Thanks to Regenerator, it doesn't care too much about residual damage from status moves like Leech Seed and Toxic. Immediately removing hazards doesn't always need to be the first course of action. Against bulky entry hazard setters like support Arceus formes, it can be beneficial to trade Toxic first before using Defog so that Ho-Oh won't be pressured to switch out first. Even if the opponent decides to switch out as Ho-Oh uses Toxic, you're still likely to get mileage out of using it on an incoming threat. Scouting is an important part of using Ho-Oh. Primal Groudon can swiftly OHKO it if it's running Stone Edge, and Necrozma-DM may actually be Ultra Necrozma, which can deal massive damage to Ho-Oh with Rock Blast or +2 Photon Geyser. Try to look for signs that Ho-Oh does in fact wall these threats before switching it in, such as the use of Overheat from Primal Groudon indicating that it is a mixed variant or Necrozma-DM revealing Leftovers or Solganium Z indicating that it's not Ultra Necrozma. If you aren't sure yet, you can use teammates like Giratina and Mega Sableye to scout. If Ho-Oh is low on health, try and find opportunities to bring it in on weak attacks and status moves or via double switches. Thanks to Regenerator, repeatedly switching Ho-Oh in will gradually restore its health, assuming Stealth Rock is kept off the field. In longer games, be wary of wasting Sacred Fire PP against Pokemon like Giratina, defensive Zygarde-C, and defensive Primal Kyogre, as they can easily wall this Ho-Oh variant.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Defensive Ho-Oh fits on balanced and stall teams that appreciate its defensive qualities and the anti-hazard support it provides. Primal Groudon is a great partner, as it checks Primal Kyogre and threatens Rock-types for Ho-Oh. In return, Ho-Oh checks Arceus-Ground for it and alleviates pressure on it to handle Fairy- and Steel-types such as Xerneas and Necrozma-DM. Steel-types make for natural partners, as Ho-Oh has great type synergy with them. Ferrothorn is notable for providing a check to Primal Kyogre, secondary check to support Arceus formes, and Spikes support; while Spikes can be awkward to pair with Ho-Oh, it does force the opponent to choose between keeping Spikes on their side of the field and using Defog and letting Ho-Oh come in for free. Similarly, defensive Necrozma-DM sets Stealth Rock and takes pressure off of Ho-Oh to check Xerneas and support Arceus formes. Magearna provides cleric support and deals more reliably with Xerneas and Yveltal. Teammates that can deal with Mega Rayquaza are helpful, since the most Ho-Oh can do against it is punish it with status or use Whirlwind to prevent it from setting up. Shuca Berry Tyranitar is a good switch-in to most Mega Rayquaza sets, while Skarmory and Celesteela wall Mega Rayquaza sets that lack V-create. Mega Sableye and Arceus-Dark check Ultra Necrozma, which Ho-Oh usually fares poorly against. The former deters the opponent's use of Stealth Rock and assists Ho-Oh in shutting down passive entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn and defensive Necrozma-DM; both appreciate Ho-Oh's ability to take advantage of Fairy-types like Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy. Giratina forms a strong hazard removal core with Ho-Oh on stall teams. It can deal with hazard setters like Stone Edge Primal Groudon and Arceus-Poison that give Ho-Oh trouble and utilize Pressure to drain the PP of these hazard setters more quickly. In return, Ho-Oh can deal with hazard setters like Arceus-Fairy that threaten Giratina. Cleric support from the likes of Xerneas, Magearna, Chansey, and Blissey is helpful, as poison compromises Ho-Oh's ability to check threats and remove entry hazards versus slower foes like Ferrothorn.</p> "

An EV spread of 248 HP / 208 Atk / 52 SpD with an Adamant nature allows Ho-Oh to survive +2 Thunder from Geomancy Xerneas. This gives it some bulk to go with its wallbreaking prowess and can be used if the extra Speed isn't needed.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Ho-Oh can find ample opportunities to switch in against Pokemon like passive Steel-types and defensive Primal Groudon to fire off its powerful attacks. Using Toxic on a predicted switch to a support Arceus forme will make it easier to break through the next time Ho-Oh comes in. Since this set is Choice-locked, Defog should be used with caution; the best scenarios in which to use it are once the opposing entry hazard setter has fainted or on a forced switch from the opponent. Locking into Defog versus support Arceus formes like Arceus-Fairy isn't advised, as they can simply stay in, status Ho-Oh with Toxic, and set Stealth Rock again the following turn. Be aware that Ferrothorn and Celesteela often carry Protect, so they can scout what Ho-Oh is locked into once the opponent realizes that it's wielding a Choice item.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Strong anti-hazard support from teammates is required. Mega Sableye and Defog Arceus-Dark are good partners, since they also check Ultra Necrozma and tend to lure in Fairy-types for Ho-Oh to take advantage of. Defog Giratina and Arceus-Ground can scout for a Rock-type move from Primal Groudon and remove the Stealth Rock it sets. Primal Groudon of your own is a great partner, as it checks Primal Kyogre and threatens Rock-types like Tyranitar, while Ho-Oh can take advantage of Arceus-Ground and put immense pressure on shared checks like Arceus-Water and Zygarde-C. Defensive Zygarde-C checks Primal Groudon variants with a Rock-type move and can use Glare to slow down support Arceus formes, letting Ho-Oh break through them more easily and potentially run an Adamant nature. Zygarde-C can also check some Mega Rayquaza and Ultra Necrozma variants for Ho-Oh, although it should be wary of their potential Dragon-type coverage. In return, Ho-Oh takes advantage of the Fairy-types that check Zygarde-C. A secondary check to support Arceus formes is recommended, as this Ho-Oh set can't always break through or remove hazards versus them effectively due to being Choice-locked. Ferrothorn and defensive Necrozma-DM are good checks to support Arceus formes that can set entry hazards to support Ho-Oh's wallbreaking; Ferrothorn also checks Primal Kyogre for Ho-Oh, while Necrozma-DM provides a sturdier check to Xerneas. Celesteela also checks support Arceus formes and Mega Rayquaza lacking V-create. Fast threats like Marshadow improve the matchup against offensive teams, which this Ho-Oh set struggles against. They appreciate Ho-Oh's ability to break through bulkier teams; Marshadow also tends to lure in Fairy-types for Ho-Oh to take advantage of. Mega Gengar revenge kills Pokemon like Ultra Necrozma and Mega Rayquaza that threaten Ho-Oh, takes advantage of the status that it spreads to fire off boosted Hexes, and improves the hazard matchup by removing the enemy Stealth Rock setter. It can also tailor its moveset to fit Ho-Oh's needs: Focus Blast hits Tyranitar and Arceus-Rock, Thunder hits Primal Kyogre and Arceus-Water, and Hidden Power Ice hits Zygarde-C. Primal Kyogre is a good partner that's able to pressure physical walls like Zygarde-C and Tyranitar, while Ho-Oh can pressure Ferrothorn and Primal Groudon for it in return. Cleric support from Xerneas and Magearna is helpful to cure Ho-Oh of status incurred from the likes of support Arceus formes and passive Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Celesteela.</p> "

Defensive Zygarde-C checks Primal Groudon variants with a Rock-type move and can use Glare to slow down support Arceus formes, letting Ho-Oh break through them more easily. Zygarde-C can also check some Mega Rayquaza and Ultra Necrozma variants for Ho-Oh, although it should be wary of their potential Dragon-type coverage. In return, Ho-Oh takes advantage of the Fairy-types and support Arceus formes that check Zygarde-C. Steel-types make for natural partners, as Ho-Oh has great type synergy with them. Ferrothorn is notable for providing a check to Primal Kyogre, a secondary check to support Arceus formes, and Spikes support; while Spikes can be awkward to pair with Ho-Oh, it does force the opponent to choose between keeping Spikes on their side of the field and using Defog and letting Ho-Oh come in for free. Similarly, defensive Necrozma-DM sets Stealth Rock and takes pressure off Ho-Oh to check Xerneas and support Arceus formes. Magearna provides cleric support and deals more reliably with Xerneas and Yveltal. Fast threats like Marshadow improve the matchup against offensive teams, which this Ho-Oh set struggles against. They appreciate Ho-Oh's ability to break through bulkier teams; Marshadow also tends to lure in Fairy-types for Ho-Oh to take advantage of. Mega Gengar revenge kills Pokemon like Ultra Necrozma and Mega Rayquaza that threaten Ho-Oh, takes advantage of the status that it spreads to fire off boosted Hexes, and improves the entry hazard matchup by removing the enemy Stealth Rock setter. It can also tailor its moveset to fit Ho-Oh's needs: Focus Blast hits Tyranitar and Arceus-Rock, Thunder hits Primal Kyogre and Arceus-Water, and Hidden Power Ice hits Zygarde-C. Primal Kyogre is a good partner that's able to pressure physical walls like Zygarde-C and Tyranitar, while Ho-Oh can pressure Ferrothorn and Primal Groudon for it in return. Cleric support from Xerneas and Magearna is helpful to cure Ho-Oh of status incurred from the likes of support Arceus formes and passive Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Celesteela.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Glalie is a very niche setup sweeper within the Anything Goes metagame due to the interesting ability Moody. By repeatedly using Protect and Substitute, Glalie is able to achieve boosts rather effortlessly. Additionally, Glalie has a sufficient movepool to aid this setup, in addition to a reliable STAB typing that nothing is immune to, unlike other Moody Pokemon. Unfortunately, Glalie has very mediocre stats and a terrible defensive typing. Glalie is relatively weak, struggling to compete with top-tier threats without multiple boosts to its Special Attack. It is also often subject to poor initial boosts and hence isn't as reliable as many other setup sweepers. Lastly, it struggles switching into anything, so it isn't able to see use unless it switches in after a Pokemon has fainted.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Disable can be used instead of Taunt to prevent Marshadow's Spectral Thief from being used; however, Taunt has much greater overall utility.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Marshadow: Marshadow's Spectral Thief can't be stopped by Taunt or Substitute and hence can only be prevented if Glalie can deal with Marshadow prior to Spectral Thief connecting. Glalie can exploit Marshadow's lack of longevity by switching out and back in later, however. Marshadow's Close Combat also OHKOes Glalie without multiple defensive boosts.</p> <p><strong>Magearna</strong>: Magearna can steal Glalie's boosts with Heart Swap if it forces Glalie into Substitute rather than Taunt. Once enough boosts have been accumulated, however, Glalie can afford to block Heart Swap with Taunt every time it wears off.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Attackers</strong>: Glalie is a relatively frail Pokemon compared to other Pokemon within the metagame and generally requires multiple defensive boosts in order to take on common offensive threats.</p> <p><strong>Phazing</strong>: While Glalie can avoid Roar and Whirlwind with Taunt and Dragon Tail with Substitute, it cannot always be in a position to use these moves, especially if it obtains poor defensive boosts initially.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Protect and Substitute are used in tandem to help Glalie obtain multiple boosts from Moody. Taunt allows Glalie to prevent opposing Pokemon from using moves that would otherwise halt setup, such as Haze, Perish Song, and Roar. Frost Breath is Glalie's preferred attack, as it is able to bypass a foe's defensive stat boosts.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Moody enables Glalie to be viable due to its potency and lack of solid checks. Leftovers provides more longevity for Glalie so that it can use Protect and Substitute more often to obtain larger boosts. Maximum Speed EVs and a Timid nature allow Glalie to outspeed Marshadow, Mega Gengar, and all Mewtwo formes after one Speed boost. 216 HP EVs allow for optimal Leftovers recovery while giving Glalie necessary bulk investment. 40 Defense EVs ensure that Glalie can take common physical attacks such as Primal Groudon's Precipice Blades and defensive Ho-Oh's Sacred Fire the majority of the time.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Protect and Substitute repeatedly in order to obtain boosts to aid a late-game sweep. Switch Glalie in once one of its teammates has fainted, and don't bring it directly into attacks. Avoid status, as Glalie needs a myriad of turns of set up to have a significant impact on a match. Remove Marshadow and Magearna prior to setting up, as Glalie must rely on chance if it plans on beating them otherwise. Feel free to switch in another Pokemon if Glalie doesn't obtain optimal boosts initially; however, be careful and ensure you have other checks to Marshadow and Magearna.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Good switch-ins to Marshadow like Arceus-Fairy and Toxapex are appreciated, as Glalie is incredibly weak to Spectral Thief and should not stay in against it. Toxic Spikes users such as Scolipede and the aforementioned Toxapex are also beneficial, as Glalie can then rack up damage while repeatedly using Protect and Substitute. Entry hazard removal is useful, as Glalie is already quite frail and can't afford to take more damage as it switches in. Steel- and Poison-types like Necrozma-DM, Skarmory, and Arceus-Poison can be used to repeatedly switch into Toxic. Clerics such as Chansey, Blissey, and Xerneas are useful, as Glalie is essentially useless if it obtains a status ailment.</p> "

  "Kyogre": {
    "overview": "<p>Primal Kyogre's high base attacking stats and access to a variety of coverage options make it one of the most threatening wallbreakers in Anything Goes. Its good natural bulk, pure Water typing, and Fire immunity courtesy of Primordial Sea lend it valuable defensive utility as well, letting it serve as a check to the likes of mixed Primal Groudon, defensive Ho-Oh, and most Calm Mind Arceus formes. As Electric- and Grass-type attacks aren't very common in Anything Goes, teams typically have to rely on brute force in order to revenge kill it. However, Kyogre tends to struggle against offensive teams, which pack faster threats such as Mega Rayquaza, Ultra Necrozma, and Marshadow that can heavily damage it with their attacks. Primal Groudon and Ferrothorn are the best defensive answers to Kyogre, and they can take advantage of it by using the opportunity to lay entry hazards or set up. Regular Kyogre can viably run a Choice Scarf set to patch up its average Speed, letting it turn the tables on offensive teams by outspeeding and OHKOing many frail attackers. However, threats like Primal Groudon and Mega Rayquaza severely limit its sweeping potential.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Roar can be used on the defensive set to phaze setup sweepers, including those behind Substitute like Vivillon and Pokemon on Baton Pass teams. Sheer Cold can be used alongside Sleep Talk on the defensive set, allowing Kyogre to eventually beat any foe that is unable to 3HKO it. This can be deadly against passive playstyles such as stall but leaves Kyogre very exploitable by offensive threats like Mega Rayquaza and Primal Groudon unless it manages to land Sheer Cold or burn the former with Scald. Choice Specs grants Kyogre insane wallbreaking power, letting it 2HKO Ferrothorn, Blissey, and Chansey with Water Spout. However, such a set still fails to 2HKO support Primal Groudon, forgoes Primal Kyogre's ability to switch up moves and replace Desolate Land or Delta Stream with its own weather, and does poorly against offensive teams, although the last point can be mitigated with Sticky Web support. Hidden Power Ground can be used on the special attacker set to hit Primal Groudon super effectively, but it has very narrow coverage and hits its target only marginally harder than Ice Beam.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Primal Groudon: Primal Groudon is immune to Water-type attacks under Desolate Land and avoids the 2HKO from all of Kyogre's special attacks bar the rare Hidden Power Ground. As long as it's alive, Kyogre can't mindlessly spam its Water-type attacks. Once Primal Groudon is on the field, it can also deal major damage to Kyogre with Precipice Blades or use the opportunity to set Stealth Rock. However, it's very prone to being worn down, since it lacks recovery outside of Rest, and it's hit hard by Earthquake from physical Primal Kyogre. Primal Groudon is also forced out by Primal Kyogre if the latter is faster and Primordial Sea is active.</p> <p><strong>Ferrothorn</strong>: Ferrothorn's bulk, typing, and access to recovery make it one of the best answers to Kyogre. It isn't weak to any of Kyogre's coverage options thanks to Primal Kyogre's own ability, and it can sustain its health with Leech Seed and Leftovers, allowing it to repeatedly switch into and withstand Kyogre's assaults. Additionally, Ferrothorn's access to Spikes makes it a very dangerous foe to give free turns to. However, it can be overwhelmed by Water Spout variants of Primal Kyogre and is setup fodder for Substitute + Calm Mind variants if it lacks a Grass-type move.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Mega Rayquaza outspeeds Kyogre, survives any attack from it after it Mega Evolves, and can choose to set up with Dragon Dance or simply OHKO it with Dragon Ascent. Ultra Necrozma forces a mind game with Kyogre over whether or not it will Ultra Burst, since it resists Water-type attacks as Ultra Necrozma but resists Ice Beam as Necrozma-DM. If Kyogre recklessly tries to attack Necrozma-DM without scouting if said foe is actually Ultra Necrozma, it may sustain massive damage from Photon Geyser or even be used as setup fodder with Swords Dance. Giratina avoids the 2HKO from all of Kyogre's moves, but it can't threaten Kyogre with much besides Toxic, so it will lose in a one-on-one scenario.</p> <p><strong>Other Water-resistant Pokemon: Arceus-Water, opposing Kyogre, and Toxapex can attempt to pivot into Kyogre on a Water-type move, but they are hit hard by Thunder, and besides Kyogre itself, they can do little back to Kyogre except stall it out with Toxic. Specially defensive Arceus-Grass is a niche Pokemon that avoids the 2HKO from all of Kyogre's moves and can heal off the damage with Recover or threaten it with a super effective Grass Knot.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Chansey: Astronomically high special bulk allow Blissey and Chansey to avoid the 2HKO from all of Kyogre's special attacks, including full-powered Modest Water Spout, if they are at full health. However, both of them lose to Calm Mind + Water Spout or physical variants of Primal Kyogre.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Lunala</strong>: With defensive investment and an intact Shadow Shield, Lunala can switch into Kyogre and take any hit from it. It can then repeatedly use Roost to restore Shadow Shield until Kyogre misses Origin Pulse or runs out of Water Spout PP, then inflict it with Toxic. However, Kyogre is capable of getting past Lunala with full-powered Modest Water Spout or a Thunder paralysis, and Lunala can't really punish RestTalk sets.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Many physical attackers that outspeed Kyogre, such as Mega Rayquaza, Marshadow, and Swords Dance Arceus formes, can easily revenge kill it after some prior chip damage. These Pokemon limit Kyogre's usefulness against offensive teams.</p> ",

        "name": "Special Attacker",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Origin Pulse is Kyogre's STAB attacking move that does large amounts of damage to most Pokemon that do not resist it. Ice Beam offers good complementary coverage alongside Origin Pulse, hitting Primal Groudon neutrally and Dragon-types like Mega Rayquaza and Zygarde-C super effectively. Calm Mind lets Kyogre break walls like Arceus-Water and win duels against Calm Mind Arceus formes if it's healthy enough. It can be used to pull off a late-game sweep once offensive checks like Marshadow, Mega Rayquaza, and Ultra Necrozma have been removed. Water Spout is an extremely powerful wallbreaking tool that allows Kyogre to muscle through some of its usual checks. Full-powered Modest Water Spout has a small chance to 2HKO Ferrothorn unboosted and 2HKOes Chansey and Blissey at +1, letting Kyogre break stall teams. Thunder hits Water-types like opposing Kyogre, Arceus-Water, and Toxapex. It also has perfect accuracy in rain, which can help out against Pokemon with evasion boosts under their belt, such as those on Baton Pass teams. Substitute can be used alongside Calm Mind, giving Kyogre the ability to set up on slow Arceus formes, support Necrozma-DM, and Ferrothorn lacking a Grass-type attack.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>72 Defense EVs let Kyogre survive Precipice Blades from Jolly Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock damage, as well as Precipice Blades from Adamant Primal Groudon, Brave Bird from Life Orb Ho-Oh, and Dragon Ascent from Choice Scarf Mega Rayquaza from full health. Maximum Speed investment lets Kyogre at worst Speed tie with Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh with a matching Speed nature. Kyogre wants to be as fast as possible so that it can fire off Water Spout or use Substitute before it is struck by a foe; it does not take Precipice Blades or Brave Bird well. The rest of the EVs are invested into Special Attack to maximize Kyogre's wallbreaking potential. A Modest nature is preferred for the extra firepower it grants Kyogre, ensuring that +1 Origin Pulse OHKOes support Arceus formes and that Ice Beam KOes Mega Rayquaza after Stealth Rock damage. A Timid nature is also viable to Speed tie with faster variants of Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and opposing Kyogre. If using this set with Substitute, an EV spread of 136 Def / 120 SpA / 252 Spe with a Timid nature is recommended; this prevents Ferrothorn's Gyro Ball from breaking Kyogre's Substitute and lets Kyogre outspeed slow Arceus formes. Alternatively, a basic EV spread of 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe with a Modest nature gives Kyogre a slightly higher chance to 2HKO Ferrothorn with full-powered Water Spout.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Against bulkier teams, secure damage on Kyogre's checks early-game so that it will be harder to switch into later. Ice Beam chips at an incoming Primal Groudon, and using Water Spout or Substitute + Calm Mind will weaken Ferrothorn. Double switching to a wallbreaker like Mega Rayquaza, Ultra Necrozma, or Marshadow on these targets can also be beneficial. If Primal Groudon is the opponent's primary switch-in to Kyogre, Ice Beam is a good midground play versus foes like Yveltal and Arceus-Ground. Use Calm Mind or Substitute to take advantage of forced switches. However, use Calm Mind sparingly if revenge killers like Mega Rayquaza, Ultra Necrozma, and Marshadow are still alive; they can easily revenge kill Kyogre if it's not behind a Substitute. Kyogre can win duels against Calm Mind Arceus formes if it's healthy enough; switch into Pokemon like Arceus-Steel as they go for their first Calm Mind boost, and then use Calm Mind alongside them until they attack Kyogre. Kyogre and the Arceus forme will have accumulated an equal number of Calm Mind boosts at this point, so during the next turn, Origin Pulse will outdamage their recovery move. Setting entry hazards beforehand assists Kyogre's wallbreaking efforts. A layer of Spikes gives Kyogre a good chance to 2HKO Ferrothorn with Water Spout and 2HKO offensive Primal Groudon with Ice Beam. Stealth Rock limits Mega Rayquaza, which is likely to claim a KO or otherwise massively dent something every time it gets a free switch into Kyogre.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Rayquaza is a great offensive partner that preys on many defensive stops to Kyogre, including Primal Groudon, Ferrothorn, and special walls like Blissey and Chansey. Entry hazard support is great for wearing down Kyogre's checks; Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and various support Arceus formes provide Stealth Rock support, while Ferrothorn and Skarmory provide Spikes support and appreciate Kyogre covering their Fire-type weakness. A solid switch-in to Primal Groudon is appreciated, as Kyogre will be unable to 2HKO it if Desolate Land is active, and Groudon can use it as setup fodder or deal heavy damage to it with Precipice Blades. Mega Rayquaza, defensive Zygarde-C, and Arceus-Ground are all capable of taking hits from Primal Groudon and revenge killing it. Other Ground-immune Pokemon like Ho-Oh and Yveltal can work too, but they are hit hard by Primal Groudon's other moves. Arceus-Fairy and Choice Scarf Xerneas can check many of the fast attackers that threaten Kyogre, including Mega Rayquaza, Ultra Necrozma, and Marshadow. In return, Kyogre puts immense pressure on many Steel-types like Necrozma-DM and Arceus-Steel and weakens Primal Groudon for them. Celesteela and Skarmory check Ultra Necrozma and are particularly helpful for dealing with Choice item variants of Mega Rayquaza, which is unlikely to use V-create into Kyogre. Kyogre can also switch into Primal Groudon for these Pokemon on the predicted use of Stealth Rock or a Fire-type move. Kyogre's middling Speed tier means that it can struggle with offensive teams, so anti-offense Pokemon such as Marshadow and Extreme Killer Arceus make for good partners. Sticky Web setters like Smeargle can pair well with this Kyogre variant, as the Speed drop from Sticky Web lets it outspeed and OHKO many would-be revenge killers like Marshadow. In return, Kyogre can put massive pressure on Defoggers like support Arceus formes and Ho-Oh, preventing them from removing Sticky Web.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rest gives Kyogre a source of recovery and removes status ailments inflicted by foes like Ho-Oh and Zygarde-C. Scald is Kyogre's primary attacking move and can punish Water-resistant Pokemon that attempt to switch in, like Ferrothorn and Mega Rayquaza, with a burn. Ice Beam offers good complementary coverage alongside Scald, hitting Primal Groudon neutrally and Dragon-types like Mega Rayquaza and Zygarde-C super effectively. Calm Mind lets Kyogre duel with Calm Mind Arceus formes if it's healthy enough and can be used to pull off a late-game sweep once its offensive checks have been removed. Sleep Talk prevents Kyogre from being completely passive while it is asleep, letting it punish trappers and setup sweepers that may try to take advantage of it. Toxic wears down Primal Groudon so that it cannot repeatedly switch into Kyogre and can be useful for putting bulky foes such as support Arceus formes on a timer. However, Kyogre will be unable to punish Primal Groudon sets with Rest, Ferrothorn is immune to it, and it makes Kyogre more prone to being used as setup fodder by Mega Rayquaza.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>20 Special Defense EVs ensure that Kyogre survives two boosted Hexes from Mega Gengar. The rest of the EVs are placed into HP and Defense with a Bold nature, giving Kyogre the bulk necessary to survive strong physical attacks from Pokemon like mixed Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM, as well as any hit from unboosted Mega Rayquaza.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Kyogre should primarily switch into passive Pokemon that rely on status to punish it, including support Arceus formes and defensive variants of Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, and Zygarde-C. Once Kyogre is safely in, assess the opponent's team. If the opponent has a Primal Groudon that's likely to switch in, it's best punished by a double switch or by utilizing another option such as Ice Beam or Toxic. Otherwise, it's often a good idea to simply spam Scald. This variant of Kyogre can survive any hit from unboosted Mega Rayquaza, including Dragon Ascent from Choice Band sets; if Kyogre is healthy enough, it can opt to stay in and use Ice Beam to punish Mega Rayquaza if it attempts to set up. Arceus-Water doesn't trouble this set as much as it does other Kyogre sets, since it cannot punish Kyogre outside of status. In fact, Kyogre can even be used as a switch-in to it to absorb status for teammates like Primal Groudon. However, if Kyogre lacks Toxic, it will be reliant on PP stalling or accumulating many Calm Mind boosts to defeat Arceus-Water, and being forced to use Rest can also leave Kyogre in an exploitable position. Kyogre struggles to take strong physical attacks even with maximum Defense investment; for example, it's 2HKOed by Precipice Blades from offensive Primal Groudon and Brave Bird from Life Orb Ho-Oh. This set's lack of Speed investment means that it will often be outsped by these attackers as well, so it's a risky switch-in to them. Instead, try to bring Kyogre in on weak or resisted physical hits, such as Thousand Arrows from Zygarde-C and Sunsteel Strike from Necrozma-DM. Be wary when using Kyogre to check Necrozma-DM; if it's actually Ultra Necrozma, it can deal massive damage to Kyogre with a boosted Photon Geyser. Scouting with a teammate like Arceus-Dark or Yveltal can be beneficial. Try to use Rest as late as possible, as Kyogre is very vulnerable while it's sleeping, especially if it lacks Sleep Talk.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Defensive Primal Kyogre fits on balanced and bulky offensive teams that appreciate the defensive utility it provides as a status absorber and bulky Water-type. This set is easily punished by Primal Groudon, so Kyogre's team should include solid, long-term checks to it like defensive Zygarde-C and Arceus-Ground. Pokemon that lure in and wear it down, like Ultra Necrozma and Geomancy Xerneas, are also effective partners. Opposing Kyogre also pose problems for this set, so Primal Groudon and Ferrothorn are good teammates. Entry hazard support is great for wearing down Kyogre's checks. Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and various support Arceus formes provide Stealth Rock support, while Ferrothorn and Skarmory provide Spikes support and appreciate Kyogre covering their Fire-type weakness. Kyogre's middling Speed tier means that it can struggle with offensive teams, so anti-offense Pokemon such as Marshadow and Extreme Killer Arceus make for good partners. Cleric support from Pokemon like Xerneas and Magearna is appreciated to quickly wake up Kyogre after it uses Rest. Pokemon that can block Leech Seed like Mega Sableye, Ferrothorn, and Arceus-Grass prevent Ferrothorn from recovering once Kyogre has burned it.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Liquidation is this set's STAB move of choice and hits very hard under Primordial Sea. With an Attack-boosting nature, it 2HKOes Chansey, support Necrozma-DM, and Arceus formes that have minimal Defense investment. The Defense drops it sometimes incurs are also helpful for breaking foes like Lugia and very defensive Arceus formes. Earthquake is one of the main draws to this set over other Kyogre variants, allowing Kyogre to 2HKO its most prominent check in Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock damage. It can help ease prediction against defensive cores, since it hits both Primal Groudon and Steel-types super effectively. Ice Beam targets Dragon-types like Mega Rayquaza, defensive Zygarde-C, and Giratina that would otherwise wall this Kyogre variant pretty easily. Thunder hits Water-types like Arceus-Water and opposing Kyogre. It also deals more damage to Pokemon like Celesteela, Skarmory, and physically defensive Yveltal, which usually avoid the 2HKO from Liquidation. The paralysis it inflicts helps Kyogre break walls like Lugia and support Arceus formes, slowing them down so that it can attack before they use Recover. Thunder also has perfect accuracy in rain, which can help out against Pokemon with evasion boosts under their belt, such as those on Baton Pass teams. Alternatively, Origin Pulse deals more damage than Liquidation to Arceus formes with a lot of Defense investment.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack investment with a Naughty nature guarantees that Kyogre's Earthquake 2HKOes support Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock damage. Maximum Speed investment lets Kyogre at worst Speed tie with Primal Groudon if it lacks a Speed-boosting nature. Kyogre wants to be as fast as possible so that it can OHKO Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh before they deal massive damage to it with Precipice Blades or Brave Bird. An alternative spread of 184 Atk / 72 Def / 252 Spe improves Kyogre's bulk significantly, letting it survive Precipice Blades from Jolly Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock damage. However, Earthquake is no longer a guaranteed 2HKO on support Primal Groudon after Stealth Rock damage, and Liquidation starts to miss the 2HKO on some Arceus formes. A Naive nature can be used instead to Speed tie with faster variants of Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and opposing Kyogre, but there is a very noticeable loss in power.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Kyogre is best used as an early-game wallbreaker that dismantles defensive cores, allowing its teammates to clean up late-game. Natural bulk and a lack of weakness to most attacks make a healthy Kyogre difficult to force out. Thus, prediction isn't too necessary when trying to wallbreak with this set; if the opponent decides to switch, it will likely be to a foe that cannot OHKO Kyogre, and Kyogre can simply hit it with the appropriate coverage move the following turn. However, don't follow this logic if the opponent has a Ferrothorn, since it hard counters this set. One should also be wary of letting Mega Rayquaza in on Liquidation or Earthquake. It's often not a bad idea for Kyogre to stay in and use Earthquake against Primal Groudon while Desolate Land is active. Primal Groudon is often a team's Stealth Rock setter, and Kyogre can punish opponents thinking they are free to set Stealth Rock as Kyogre is forced out. The presence of a Ground-immune Pokemon such as Mega Rayquaza or Yveltal on the team can deter Primal Groudon's use of Precipice Blades. If Primal Groudon is the opponent's primary switch-in to Kyogre, Ice Beam is a good midground play versus foes like Yveltal and Arceus-Ground; it still hits Primal Groudon for decent chip damage without giving away Kyogre's set. A healthy Ferrothorn switches into this set with impunity and can use the opportunity to set Spikes or annoy Kyogre's teammates with Leech Seed. Usually, it's best to double switch to a wallbreaker like Mega Rayquaza or Marshadow to pressure it before it gets the chance to do so. Revealing Liquidation too early can tip off your opponent that Kyogre is a physical variant and make them less likely to stay in with Pokemon like Primal Groudon and Chansey. Ice Beam and Thunder can be used to bluff the special attacker set and punish Pokemon like Giratina and Lugia, respectively, that try to scout for this set. Setting entry hazards beforehand assists Kyogre's wallbreaking efforts. Stealth Rock damage is needed for Kyogre to secure the 2HKO on support Primal Groudon with Earthquake. Stealth Rock also limits Mega Rayquaza, which is likely to claim a KO or otherwise massively dent something every time it gets a free switch into Kyogre.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Arceus-Fairy and Choice Scarf Xerneas can revenge kill many of the fast attackers that threaten Kyogre, including Mega Rayquaza, Ultra Necrozma, and Marshadow. In return, Kyogre puts immense pressure on many Steel-types like Necrozma-DM and Arceus-Steel and weakens Primal Groudon for them. Various other Pokemon that benefit from Primal Groudon being weakened, such as Necrozma-DM and Magearna, enjoy having this Kyogre set as a partner. Ferrothorn stops this set cold, so teammates that can put offensive pressure on it such as Mega Rayquaza, Marshadow, and non-Choice-locked Ho-Oh are needed. Pokemon that lure and take out Ferrothorn such as Calm Mind + Fire Blast Arceus-Fairy also pair nicely with this set. Ground-immune Pokemon like Mega Rayquaza, Ho-Oh, and Yveltal shield Kyogre against Primal Groudon by forcing it into mind games over whether or not to use Precipice Blades. Stronger checks to Primal Groudon such as defensive Zygarde-C and Arceus-Ground are also helpful partners, but they are not as necessary for this Kyogre set as they are for others. Mega Gengar can trap and weaken Ferrothorn and Arceus-Water for Kyogre using Focus Blast and Thunder. It can also revenge kill fast threats that Kyogre struggles with, including Ultra Necrozma, Extreme Killer Arceus, and unboosted Mega Rayquaza. As usual, Stealth Rock setters like Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and support Arceus formes and Spikes setters like Ferrothorn and Skarmory are useful for wearing down Kyogre's checks. Stealth Rock damage is needed before Kyogre can 2HKO support Primal Groudon with Earthquake. This set is more prone to becoming setup fodder for Mega Rayquaza due to its lack of Special Attack investment. Pokemon such as defensive Arceus-Fairy, defensive Zygarde-C, and Celesteela can limit the damage a +1 Mega Rayquaza inflicts on Kyogre's team. Kyogre's middling Speed tier means that it can struggle with offensive teams, so anti-offense Pokemon such as Marshadow and Extreme Killer Arceus make for good partners. Pokemon that can block Leech Seed like Mega Sableye, Ferrothorn, and Arceus-Grass help with Ferrothorn, which is a major nuisance for this set.</p> "

Ice Beam offers good complementary coverage alongside Origin Pulse, hitting Primal Groudon neutrally and Dragon-types such as Mega Rayquaza and Zygarde-C super effectively. Thunder targets Water-types like opposing Kyogre, Arceus-Water, and Toxapex.

A Timid nature is also viable so that Kyogre outspeeds Modest Choice Scarf Xerneas and Yveltal, but there is a noticeable loss in power.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Think twice before locking into a Water-type move while the opponent's Primal Groudon is still alive. Using Ice Beam or Sheer Cold or pulling a double switch may be better alternatives. Kyogre should also be wary of giving Mega Rayquaza a free setup opportunity if it decides to lock into a Water-type move. A healthy Ferrothorn walls this Kyogre variant with ease, so it's best to use Sheer Cold or pull a double switch if you think it's going to come in. Prediction is a bigger factor when utilizing this Kyogre set; the opponent may try to pivot around it with Water-resistant Pokemon like Arceus-Water and Mega Rayquaza if they lack a Primal Groudon or want to avoid having it take chip damage. Try not to reveal that Kyogre isn't Primal Kyogre immediately; this way, the opponent may be less cautious about preserving their Primal Groudon, which will open the door for Kyogre to sweep late-game. If Kyogre aims to sweep with Water Spout, its health should be conserved as much as possible. Using Defog or Rapid Spin to clear the field of entry hazards before Kyogre comes in is highly beneficial. It's also best to remove priority users like Mega Rayquaza, Marshadow, and Extreme Killer Arceus beforehand, since they can weaken Water Spout to the point where Kyogre is unable to break past a wall or even becomes setup fodder for a sweeper.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Checks to Primal Groudon like Mega Rayquaza, defensive Zygarde-C, and Arceus-Ground are mandatory, since it easily shuts down this set. Pokemon that lure and wear down Primal Groudon, like Ultra Necrozma, Geomancy Xerneas, and even physical Primal Kyogre, are also effective partners. A healthy Ferrothorn is tough for this set to break, so teammates that can put offensive pressure on it are needed. Mega Rayquaza, Marshadow, and non-Choice-locked Ho-Oh are all good partners in this regard. Pokemon that lure Ferrothorn and take out such as Calm Mind + Fire Blast Arceus-Fairy also pair nicely with this set. Mega Gengar can pick off a weakened Primal Groudon or force a trade with Destiny Bond, guaranteeing its removal thanks to Shadow Tag. Access to options like Focus Blast, Thunder, and Taunt or Perish Song lets it target various Pokemon that may stand in the way of Kyogre's sweep, including Ferrothorn, Arceus-Water, and Chansey, respectively. This set is very punishable by Mega Rayquaza, as it can use Kyogre as setup fodder if it's locked into a Water-type move. Pokemon such as defensive Arceus-Fairy, defensive Zygarde-C, and Celesteela can limit the damage a boosted Mega Rayquaza inflicts on Kyogre's team. As usual, Stealth Rock setters like Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and support Arceus formes and Spikes setters like Ferrothorn and Skarmory are useful for wearing down Kyogre's checks.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>As the premier offensive threat in Anything Goes, Mega Rayquaza boasts incredible attacking stats backed by a stellar movepool. Base 115 Speed is quite solid and lets it outpace many offensive threats, such as Primal Groudon, Yveltal, Xerneas, and Zygarde-C. Mega Rayquaza further benefits from being able to hold an item unlike other Mega Evolutions, making it unpredictable and dangerous. This allows it to run multiple movesets viably, making Mega Rayquaza incredibly difficult to deal with before its set is revealed. However, while base 115 speed is quite fast, Mega Rayquaza can be outpaced by Arceus as well as other faster threats such as Mega Gengar and Ultra Necrozma. While its bulk is above average for an offensive threat when combined with Delta Stream, repeated uses of Dragon Ascent leave it vulnerable to priority from the likes of Arceus and Marshadow.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Swords Dance instead of Dragon Dance gives Mega Rayquaza tremendous power, allowing it to break past many of its checks such as defensive Zygarde-C and Arceus-Fairy. However, the lack of a Speed boost leaves it vulnerable to faster support Arceus formes as well as Marshadow and Mega Gengar. A Choice Specs set with Draco Meteor, Overheat, Surf, and Dragon Ascent is an option to take advantage of Rayquaza's Special Attack, yet it is quite lackluster due to the restriction of Dragon Ascent and lack of special coverage. Bulk Up is an alternative setup move over Dragon Dance that makes Rayquaza harder to revenge kill but is usually inferior to the Speed boost gained from Dragon Dance. Substitute can be run on the Dragon Dance set over Extreme Speed to ease predictions and prevent status. However, the utility gained from Extreme Speed overshadows this benefit for the most part. Outrage is an alternative move on many sets, but it is generally an inferior move compared to Dragon Ascent. Likewise, Overheat can be used over V-create on the mixed Life Orb set, but since it is much weaker, it is not generally used.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p>Mega Rayquaza is unique in that it is nearly impossible to counter, and as such only the best checks are presented.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Fairy-types: Bulky Fairy-types, such as Arceus-Fairy and Xerneas, can take even any boosted hit most of the time and OHKO Mega Rayquaza with their STAB moves. However, both get 2HKOed by Life Orb boosted Dragon Ascent, limiting their ability to switch in.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Shuca Berry Tyranitar and Arceus-Rock can switch in on both Dragon Ascent and V-create. Unfortunately, Tyranitar gets 2HKOed by Draco Meteor, while Arceus-Rock will either get OHKOed by +1 Life Orb boosted Earthquake or 2HKOed by Draco Meteor if it is more physically defensive.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Walls: Defensive Zygarde-C, Lugia, and Giratina are able to avoid the OHKO from Life Orb Mega Rayquaza's +1 Dragon Ascent as well as the 2HKO from its unboosted  Dragon Ascent. In return, they can retaliate with either Dragon Tail or Ice Beam. Unfortunately, Lugia loses to Choice Band Mega Rayquaza, Zygarde-C gets OHKOed by Draco Meteor, and Giratina falls to both.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Skarmory and Celesteela can easily wall out the Dragon Dance variant with Earthquake, but V-create OHKOes both. Arceus-Steel and Necrozma-DM can switch in on Dragon Ascent, but both fall prey to V-create as well.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Mega Gengar and Marshadow are immune to Extreme Speed and can pick off a weakened Mega Rayquaza. Marshadow also carries Shadow Sneak, allowing it to revenge kill Mega Rayquaza even after a Dragon Dance. Other faster threats include Ultra Necrozma and Choice Scarf Xerneas, but they take heavy damage from Extreme Speed.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Arceus Formes: Many bulky Arceus formes can avoid a 2HKO from Choice Scarf Mega Rayquaza's Dragon Ascent and an OHKO from +1 Life Orb boosted Dragon Ascent, rendering them viable checks in specific scenarios. However, the inability to OHKO Mega Rayquaza from full makes Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Water, and Arceus-Dark much less viable than Arceus-Fairy as a check.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: One of the best ways to hinder Mega Rayquaza is to set up Stealth Rock, as Rayquaza will take 25% of damage from the entry hazard every single time it switches in, making it easier to revenge kill.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>: Mega Rayquaza hates status in general, with some sets such as Choice Scarf especially disliking paralysis and others like Dragon Dance and Choice Band being completely neutered by burns. Hence, inflicting Mega Rayquaza with status is a good way to limit its versatility and wear it down.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragon Ascent is required for Mega Evolution and provides Mega Rayquaza a powerful Flying-type attack. Dragon Dance allows Mega Rayquaza to outpace most threats and threaten to sweep. Extreme Speed picks off faster Pokemon and revenge kills weakened threats. Earthquake can hit many Flying-type answers, including Arceus-Rock, Arceus-Steel, and Necrozma-DM. V-create is a potent option that allows Mega Rayquaza to beat certain checks such as Celesteela and Skarmory. However, the Speed drop from usage limits Mega Rayquaza's ability as a sweeper and leaves it unable to defeat Arceus-Rock or Tyranitar alone.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Attack EVs backed by an Adamant nature maximize Mega Rayquaza's offensive power, while 252 Speed EVs allow it to Speed tie with opposing Mega Rayquaza as well as outspeed the likes of Primal Groudon, Yveltal, and bulkier Arceus formes. Life Orb is used to boost Rayquaza's attacking abilities, allowing Dragon Ascent to 2HKO almost anything that does not resist Flying.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Dragon Dance Mega Rayquaza should set up sparingly, as once it has set up Dragon Dance, it is unlikely to switch out until it has been revenge killed. Try to bring Mega Rayquaza on Pokemon it can counter or force out, such as Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh. Eliminating priority users such as Marshadow and opposing Mega Rayquaza before attempting to set up is necessary to avoid being revenge killed after just one KO. Against bulkier teams, Dragon Ascent may be spammed liberally to deal heavy damage to switch-ins.  Try to keep Mega Rayquaza healthy in case it is needed for revenge killing purposes; however, it is often a good choice to utilize Mega Rayquaza to heavily damage a threat such as Arceus-Fairy so teammates such as Bulk Up Marshadow can sweep later on.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Dragon Dance Mega Rayquaza is incredibly versatile and as such can work well with almost anything due to its sheer power and utility. However, Mega Rayquaza does greatly appreciate suicide leads such as Deoxys-S and Excadrill that can set  up and prevent entry hazards. As offensive partners, Rock Polish Necrozma-DM greatly appreciates Mega Rayquaza's ability to weaken checks such as Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre, while in return it can counter troublesome Fairy-types such as Xerneas and Arceus-Fairy. Primal Kyogre pairs well with Mega Rayquaza, since both of them pressure Primal Groudon, while Kyogre also heavily threatens most support Arceus formes. Yveltal and Groudon provide strong offensive presences that can weaken many of Mega Rayquaza's checks. Calm Mind Arceus-Steel can clean late-game after Mega Rayquaza has worn down many of its checks, such as Ho-Oh, Primal Kyogre, and Primal Groudon. Geomancy Xerneas also appreciates Mega Rayquaza's ability to pressure Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, and Primal Groudon. Lunala along with Rayquaza can completely tear apart defensive cores, as the two have perfect offensive coverage.</p> "

Earthquake can hit Arceus-Rock and Steel-types without dropping Mega Rayquaza's Speed, and Surf is used to OHKO Primal Groudon and can hit Arceus-Rock as well. Toxic can cripple common switch-ins that will not be 2HKOed by any of Mega Rayquaza's moves, such as bulky Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Ground. If necessary, Defog is an option for entry hazard removal and should be considered if the team lacks another Defogger.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 Attack EVs maximize Mega Rayquaza's attacking prowess, allowing it to 2HKO most of the metagame with either Dragon Ascent or V-create. 252 Speed EVs with a positive Speed nature as well as a Choice Scarf ensure that Mega Rayquaza outspeeds the entire unboosted metagame as well as Adamant Necrozma-DM after a Rock Polish. A Naive nature is chosen to ensure Mega Rayquaza takes less damage from Extreme Speed from Arceus and Mega Rayquaza as well as Shadow Sneak from Marshadow.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Mega Rayquaza should be brought in primarily for revenge killing, but it can also come in on Pokemon it can check, such as Primal Groudon. If Mega Rayquaza is needed to revenge kill key threats such as Ultra Necrozma and Arceus-Steel, be sure to keep it healthy throughout the game. Since Life Orb is the most common item on Mega Rayquaza, try to avoid revealing Choice Scarf until needed, since it may be able to net unexpected OHKOs. Against faster offensive teams, Mega Rayquaza can be utilized late-game as a cleaner as well.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Mega Rayquaza appreciates Defog support from teammates, and Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Fairy, and Arceus-Dark are fantastic teammates that can provide that.

Ferrothorn and Primal Kyogre can take on many of the common switch-ins to Choice Scarf Mega Rayquaza, especially Arceus-Rock. Zygarde-C can check a myriad of physically attacking Pokemon that can force Mega Rayquaza out, including Necrozma-DM, Ho-Oh, and Arceus.

Earthquake hits Rock-types such as Arceus-Rock and Tyranitar that resist Dragon Ascent for super effective damage. Waterfall is a weaker option that can OHKO Primal Groudon as well as hit Arceus-Rock and Tyranitar.

Prediction is key, since with Choice Band, Mega Rayquaza may be locked into an unfavorable move. Dragon Ascent is generally the best move to spam, with Earthquake and V-create primarily being used to land an OHKO or a 2HKO on switch-ins that resist Flying. As Choice Band Mega Rayquaza is not particularly common, the sheer surprise may be enough to catch opponents off guard with OHKOs on threats such as Primal Kyogre that no other sets can do. Mega Rayquaza can also be utilized to revenge kill faster weakened threats with Extreme Speed, but this can be risky due to momentum being lost after Mega Rayquaza is locked into the move.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Choice Band Mega Rayquaza can easily break a large hole in many teams, and as such cleaners such as Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, Dragon Dance Zygarde-C, and Swords Dance Ultra-Necrozma work well with this set. Groudon-Primal and Necrozma-DM can provide Stealth Rock support to weaken switch-ins. Arceus-Fairy is a great teammate, as it provides Defog support as well as a check to Zygarde-C, one of the most common switch-ins to Rayquaza. Ho-Oh can check a majority of Calm Mind Arceus formes that Choice Band Mega Rayquaza struggles against because they outspeed it.

Extreme Speed is a fantastic revenge killing tool, being able to pick off weakened Ultra Necrozma and Xerneas. V-create is the preferred coverage option, as it hits Steel-types that resist both Draco Meteor and Dragon Ascent for an OHKO. Earthquake is an alternative option to hit Arceus-Rock for a 2HKO.

A Naive or Naughty nature is chosen to reduce damage from opposing priority moves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Mixed Life Orb Mega Rayquaza's most important quality is its ability to OHKO Zygarde-C and physically defensive Yveltal as well as offensive Primal Groudon with Draco Meteor. As such, taking advantage of the ability to bluff Dragon Dance is the key to this set, allowing it to catch the aforementioned walls off guard. If not needed to revenge kill threats such as Ultra Necrozma and Primal Kyogre, Mega Rayquaza should be brought in as much as possible so it can punch holes in defensive cores early in the game. Longevity is not as much of a concern for this set, as it is meant to do damage early-game to allow teammates to attempt sweeping later on.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mixed Rayquaza excels at luring physically defensive Zygarde-C and Yveltal to enable other teammates to sweep, notably Swords Dance Necrozma-DM, Swords Dance Ultra Necrozma, and Bulk Up Marshadow. Ho-Oh greatly appreciates the pressure that Mega Rayquaza applies on Zygarde-C as well as Arceus-Water, and can it provide a stop to most Calm Mind Arceus formes. Arceus-Rock hard walls this set if it's running V-create, so Arceus-Steel and Arceus-Ground, along with Primal Kyogre, are fantastic teammates to switch into its STAB attacks. All variants of Primal Groudon pair well with this Mega Rayquaza set, since Primal Groudon will often find its checks pressured by Mega Rayquaza and can help it by setting Stealth Rock.

It also checks various other threats like Ho-Oh, most Swords Dance Arceus formes, and Primal Groudon. Its Ghost typing is notable as well, as it allows Giratina to avoid being trapped by Mega Gengar, Whirlpool + Perish Song Arceus formes, and Gothitelle. However, Giratina suffers from passivity and must rely on Rest for its own recovery, which makes it easy to wear down through chip damage and take advantage of by setting up. It can also be very easily checked by top threats like Yveltal, Marshadow, Xerneas, and Arceus-Fairy.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sleep Talk may seem appealing as to let Giratina not be so passive after Rest, but this move is not as helpful as the others in its moveset. A more physically defensive spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD with a Relaxed nature and 30 Spe IVs can be used if more physical bulk is desired.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Super Effective Attackers</strong>: Pokemon like Yveltal, Arceus-Fairy, Lunala, and Marshadow all force Giratina out with their strong super effective attacks. Xerneas and Arceus-Dark also can't be beaten with status thanks to their access to status-healing moves. They also have setup options in Geomancy and Calm Mind, respectively. Arceus-Fairy can use the turn Giratina switches to set Stealth Rock. These Pokemon can also take advantage of Giratina being asleep from Rest to set up scot-free.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon Resistant or Immune to Status: Pokemon like Zygarde-C with Rest, Arceus-Poison, Xerneas, and Arceus-Dark can wall Giratina due to their ability to absorb status and either cripple or set up on Giratina.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Due to Giratina's lack of offensive presence, even with Dragon Tail, Taunt users like Mega Gengar and Mewtwo make it unable to do much, if anything, and force it out.</p> <p><strong>Substitute: If Giratina lacks Roar, Substitute users like Marshadow and Zygarde-C can take advantage of Giratina to set up their boosting moves.

Giratina gets lots of opportunities to use Defog as well thanks to the fact that it beats almost every Stealth Rock setter in the tier. Rest is Giratinaâ€™s only form of reliable recovery, and it should be used sparingly due to how easily exploited it leaves Giratina. Toxic is a helpful move to hit checks like Yveltal, Xerneas, and Arceus-Fairy on the switch, making it Giratina's main and potentially only source of damage. It cripples Primal Groudon as well, making it lose to Giratina in the long run. Will-O-Wisp is a useful move to burn physical attackers like Mega Rayquaza, Swords Dance Arceus formes, and offensive unboosted Necrozma-DM.

Leftovers allows Giratina to recover HP passively and lessen its reliance on Rest. Pressure notably makes Stealth Rock effectively have less PP than Defog, which allows Giratina to PP stall the move.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Giratina's amazing bulk allows it to take hits from almost any physical attacker that can't hit it super effectively and even from some that do. Its ability to deplete the foe's PP quickly via Pressure should also be taken advantage of, especially against the Stealth Rock setters it checks. Remove entry hazards from your side of the field whenever possible. Try bringing in Giratina on the entry hazard setters it checks, like Excadrill and Necrozma-DM. Make sure Giratina is left healthy and without status, as status hurts its ability to check the things it's meant to and forces it to use Rest earlier. Once Giratina uses Rest, try to switch out if possible so you can get rid of status from it as Rest leaves Giratina very passive and easy to take advantage of. Attempt to cripple the opposing team with status to wear them down if given the chance. If Roar or Dragon Tail are being used, use them if a foe is setting up or to get reliable chip on the opposing team if entry hazards are up. Make sure Giratina is healthy enough to take Z-Moves from certain Pokemon it's meant to check, such as Arceus-Ground and Necrozma-DM. Finally, avoid taking Knock Off, as Giratina becomes a lot easier to handle without the passive recovery Leftovers provides.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Due to Giratina's passive nature, it only really fits on stall and bulky balance teams. Clerics like Chansey, Blissey, and defensive Xerneas are very helpful to cure Giratina of status, most notably sleep due to Giratina's reliance on Rest. Chansey and Blissey give the benefit of passing Wish, and Blissey can escape Mega Gengar thanks to Shed Shell, while Xerneas checks Dark-types like Yveltal and Arceus-Dark. Ho-Oh forms a good double Defog core with Giratina and can act as a backup check to Necrozma-DM, Calm Mind Arceus-Steel, and Marshadow as well as check the Fairy-types Giratina is weak to, most notably Stealth Rock Arceus-Fairy. It also benefits heavily from Giratina's Defog support itself. Arceus-Fairy works well with Giratina, as it checks Dark-types like Yveltal and even Zygarde-C should Giratina lack Roar or Dragon Tail and can set Stealth Rock. Giratina in return handles Necrozma-DM for Arceus-Fairy. Skarmory acts as a secondary switch-in to Necrozma-DM, Mega Rayquaza lacking V-create, and Arceus-Ground. It even pivots into potential Toxic and can phaze setup sweepers. Its access to Spikes also makes the switches Giratina helps Giratina take more advantage of Roar and Dragon Tail. Lugia can check Zygarde-C and Mega Rayquaza with Ice Beam for Giratina should it lack Roar or Dragon Tail, and Giratina clears Stealth Rock for Lugia, which helps it get much more milage out of Multiscale. Mega Gengar can trap and remove potentially problematic Fairy-types like Arceus-Fairy and Xerneas for Giratina, which can check Primal Groudon for Mega Gengar.</p> "

Dread Plate is needed to use Arceus-Dark and make its Judgment Dark-type and more powerful.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Fairy-types like Xerneas, Magearna, Clefable, and Arceus-Fairy wall Calm Mind Arceus-Dark, so it is necessary to make sure that they are weakened enough before attempting a Calm Mind sweep. Physical attackers like Marshadow and Mega Mewtwo X force Arceus-Dark to switch out, so it is best to not set up Calm Mind until these threats are removed. Refresh and Recover allow Arceus-Dark to set up on most support Arceus formes and defensive walls like Ferrothorn, Celesteela, Zygarde-C lacking Haze or Dragon Tail, and Necrozma-DM without worrying about getting worn down by Toxic or other status moves. Arceus-Dark can also set up on special attackers like Yveltal, Overheat support Primal Groudon, and Lunala. If running Refresh, Arceus-Dark also acts as a status absorber for the team.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Gengar is an excellent teammate for Arceus-Dark, as it can trap and remove Arceus-Fairy, Xerneas, and specially defensive walls like Chansey, which can otherwise threaten Arceus-Dark. Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM can weaken or possibly KO Arceus-Fairy, Xerneas, Tyranitar, and Magearna, which helps Arceus-Dark to sweep the rest of the team. Necrozma-DM is also the most reliable check to Fairy-types, as it gets reliable recovery and a 100-Base Power STAB move in Sunsteel Strike that does heavy damage to every Fairy-type. Arceus-Fairy is a solid switch-in to Marshadow and Mega Mewtwo X, which threaten and force Arceus-Dark to switch out. Zygarde-C spreads status easily and provides a reliable switch-in to physical attackers that threaten Arceus-Dark. Whirlpool + Perish Song Arceus formes like Arceus-Poison can remove specially defensive walls and allow Arceus-Dark to sweep.</p> "

Recover restores Arceus-Dark's HP, allowing it to check the Pokemon it is supposed to check. Will-O-Wisp is the main status move used on Arceus-Dark, as it reduces the target's Attack, letting Arceus-Dark check physical attackers more easily. Toxic can be used over Will-O-Wisp to punish switch-ins like Primal Groudon and Arceus-Fairy. Defog is used to clear off entry hazards. Stealth Rock can be used over Defog if the team already has sufficient entry hazard control or lacks a Stealth Rock user. Alternatively, Ice Beam allows Arceus-Dark to beat Zygarde-C and Yveltal more consistently.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP and 160 Defense EVs give Arceus-Dark the bulk it needs to check physical attackers more effectively. 96 Speed EVs allow Arceus-Dark to outspeed Adamant Mega Rayquaza if running a Timid nature and Yveltal with a matching Speed nature. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 44 Def / 216 Spe with a Timid nature can be used to outspeed Jolly Mega Rayquaza. Dread Plate is necessary to use Arceus-Dark and makes Judgment Dark-type.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Arceus-Dark is a solid switch-in to Lunala, Arceus-Ghost, support Necrozma-DM, and Ultra Necrozma. If running Ice Beam or Toxic, Arceus-Dark can be used as a switch-in to Yveltal and Zygarde. Arceus-Dark is the most viable anti-Shadow Tag support Arceus forme, as it does super effective damage to both Mega Gengar and Gothitelle. Toxic is used to cripple Fairy-type switch-ins to prevent them from coming in freely. Will-O-Wisp should be used liberally against teams with Marshadow, as allowing Marshadow to set up or force Arceus-Dark out can be incredibly detrimental. Recover should be used to keep Arceus-Dark at high health. Arceus-Dark hates getting hit by Toxic, so it is necessary to keep it away from Toxic users. Arceus-Dark can freely set up Stealth Rock or Defog away entry hazards against support Arceus formes, except Arceus-Fairy, and other passive Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Celesteela, Skarmory, defensive Zygarde-C, and support Necrozma-DM.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Necrozma-DM is one of the best teammates for support Arceus-Dark, as it is a solid check to Fairy-types like Xerneas, Arceus-Fairy, and Clefable. Defensive Ho-Oh also pairs excellently with Arceus-Dark, as it is a reliable switch-in to Fairy-types and Marshadow lacking Rock Tomb. Arceus-Poison is another great teammate for Arceus-Dark, since it is a very good check to both Fairy-types and Marshadow. Arceus-Dark can benefit from Primal Groudon's amazing bulk, typing, and ability to spread status very effectively. Mega Gengar is another very good teammate, as it removes most of the threats that bother Arceus-Dark as well as other statused and weakened Pokemon.</p> "

  "Arceus-Fairy": {
    "overview": "<p>Arceus-Fairy is a staple within the Anything Goes metagame thanks to its great offensive and defensive typing, expansive movepool, and impressive natural bulk. Due to this, it can reliably take on many potent threats within the metagame, such as Mega Rayquaza, Marshadow, Mega Sableye, Yveltal, and Zygarde-C. The ability to check these Pokemon makes Arceus-Fairy incredibly useful on balance teams that are often threatened by them otherwise. Arceus-Fairy's extensive movepool also allows it to be relatively unpredictable, with access to a plethora of coverage and status moves. This allows Arceus-Fairy to take on or impair most threats without much difficulty. However, Arceus-Fairy's crippling weakness to both Shadow Tag users limits its potential significantly. Additionally, while Fairy is often a great offensive typing, Arceus-Fairy is limited in its offensive capabilities by Necrozma-DM, which counters it. Arceus-Fairy is also heavily impaired by the myriad of other Steel-types in the metagame, in addition to Ho-Oh, Primal Groudon, and Arceus-Poison.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A lead set can be run with extra utility over Recover to take advantage of Arceus-Fairy's ability to force out Magic Bounce users like Mega Sableye and reliably set up Stealth Rock. This set often includes Judgment, Stealth Rock, Roar, and Toxic. Stone Edge can be used to lure in and KO Ho-Oh; however, without significant Attack investment, Arceus-Fairy struggles to OHKO even offensive variants. Perish Song can be slotted on the support set to deal with Baton Pass teams efficiently, especially if they lack Mr. Mime. Roar can be run on the support set without sacrificing recovery to deal with opposing setup sweepers and Gothitelle. However, if the Gothitelle user knows that Arceus-Fairy is running Roar, they can prevent being phazed by repeatedly using Taunt and Rest. Thunder on the Calm Mind set gives Arceus-Fairy an option to hit Celesteela, Ho-Oh, and Skarmory somewhat efficiently. It should only really be considered if Ho-Oh is unable to be dealt with effectively by another teammate. Will-O-Wisp is an option on the Calm Mind set to weaken incoming Necrozma-DM and Arceus-Poison, but it's often not as useful as the respective attacks to hit either. Iron Defense on the Calm Mind set allows Arceus-Fairy to set up against many offensive builds, although it is virtually useless if the opposing team has a Marshadow still remaining. Refresh is a mediocre option on both sets but does still serve a relevant purpose. It is, however, often not worth sacrificing another moveslot for. Arceus-Fairy can also run maximum Special Attack investment on Calm Mind sets, but this is rarely ever worth it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Shadow Tag: Gothitelle and Mega Gengar both easily remove Arceus-Fairy without much to fear in return. Offensive Mega Gengar sets may be unable to eliminate Earth Power variants of Arceus-Fairy if it has already used Calm Mind once.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Arceus-Fairy is unable to deal with any Necrozma-DM sets effectively; however, its power can be sufficiently weakened by Will-O-Wisp. Even while burned, Necrozma-DM checks Arceus-Fairy quite reliably. Prism Armor makes all of Arceus-Fairy's coverage attacks relatively weak and unable to deal sufficient damage. Other more defensive Steel-types like Celesteela, Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Magearna can all deal with defensive variants of Arceus-Fairy without much hassle, although offensive variants of Arceus-Fairy can overwhelm the former three.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh: Ho-Oh can easily switch into all of Arceus-Fairy's attacks while shrugging off Toxic due to its ability Regenerator. Arceus-Fairy can stall out Ho-Oh with Toxic and require it to switch out if Arceus-Fairy is unable to be badly poisoned due to an alternate status ailment.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Primal Groudon can switch into any of Arceus-Fairy's attacks reliably except Earth Power. Due to this, it can find many ways to take advantage of Arceus-Fairy, such as using Swords Dance, setting up Stealth Rock, or firing off a powerful attack. Primal Groudon should still be wary of residual damage from moves like Toxic, though.</p> <p><strong>Arceus-Poison</strong>: Arceus-Poison handles support variants of Arceus-Fairy extremely well without any concerns; however, some defensive Arceus-Poison sets may struggle against Calm Mind + Earth Power Arceus-Fairy.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls</strong>: Blissey and Chansey are both able to reliably stall Arceus-Fairy with Toxic in conjunction with Confide and Soft-Boiled. Clefable is unable to be 3HKOed due to Unaware and Leftovers, and it can easily deal with Arceus-Fairy as a result.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Judgment is Arceus-Fairy's strongest STAB move, allowing it to OHKO Marshadow, Yveltal, and Mega Rayquaza after Stealth Rock damage while doing substantial damage to Zygarde-C and Giratina. Recover ensures Arceus-Fairy can preserve its health throughout the match to let it switch into attacks such as Yveltal's Oblivion Wing repeatedly. Stealth Rock is a great option, as Arceus-Fairy is able to force out Mega Sableye and Yveltal, the latter of which may be equipped with Defog. Defog can be slotted onto Arceus-Fairy if entry hazard removal is hard to fit; however, its weakness to common trappers and hazard setters makes Defog a subpar option. Toxic allows Arceus-Fairy to deal with a few common switch-ins in Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon, ensuring these Pokemon cannot come in freely. Will-O-Wisp provides Arceus-Fairy with a way to impair Necrozma-DM and other Steel-types but is usually less useful than Toxic, as Necrozma-DM still threatens Arceus-Fairy, and other Steel-types can shrug off the burn damage with Leftovers and Leech Seed.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>16 Speed EVs enable Arceus-Fairy to outspeed maximum Speed neutral-natured base 90s, such as Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon. The rest of the EVs are invested into its physical bulk in order to maximize its chances of surviving a +1 Mega Rayquaza's Dragon Ascent after Stealth Rock damage. Alternatively, Arceus-Fairy can run the same set with 248 HP / 8 SpA / 252 Spe and a Timid nature to outspeed Mega Rayquaza and Speed tie with other maximum Speed Arceus formes. Pixie Plate gives Arceus-Fairy's already potent Judgment a slight boost.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Arceus-Fairy's defensive typing strategically by switching into Pokemon whose attacks it resists and capitalizing on opportunities to spread status and set or remove entry hazards. Utilize Recover to carefully preserve Arceus-Fairy throughout the match. Play Arceus-Fairy extremely carefully against teams with Shadow Tag users such as Mega Gengar and Gothitelle, as letting it get trapped by either almost always results in Arceus-Fairy fainting. Prevent Arceus-Fairy from gaining a status ailment, as it won't be able to reliably check Pokemon it would normally have no issue with. If opposing Mega Rayquaza are revealed to be holding a Choice Scarf or Lum Berry, keep Arceus-Fairy healthy so it can be used as a check. Avoid revealing Will-O-Wisp against opposing teams unless you are sure that Necrozma-DM or another Pokemon that does not appreciate being burned will switch in.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pursuit trappers such as Tyranitar and Marshadow can remove common Mega Gengar sets that would otherwise make Arceus-Fairy a lot worse from matchup. Pokemon that can reliably check Necrozma-DM, such as Arceus-Dark, Arceus-Water, and Yveltal, are good teammates, as Arceus-Fairy can use a turn to perform whatever function is required without worrying about a potential Necrozma-DM switch-in. Reliable checks for Primal Groudon, such as Zygarde-C and Arceus-Ground, make for good teammates, as they can deal with one of Arceus-Fairy's biggest threats. Primal Groudon is an excellent option because it can capitalize off Steel- and Poison-types that appreciate Arceus-Fairy's inability to hit them both while benefiting from Arceus-Fairy taking on Primal Groudon's weaknesses in Yveltal and Zygarde-C. Gothitelle can remove bulky Steel-types and Arceus-Poison for Arceus-Fairy so that it can freely use Toxic without concern. Reliable defensive answers to Mega Rayquaza, such as Arceus-Rock and Tyranitar, are incredibly useful, as Arceus-Fairy is unable to switch into both Choice Band and Life Orb variants. Ghost-types like Mega Gengar and Lunala appreciate Arceus-Fairy's ability to efficiently and repeatedly switch into Yveltal. Mega Gengar specifically appreciates Arceus-Fairy's matchup versus Zygarde-C. Primal Kyogre can handle many of Arceus-Fairy's common checks well but can miss out on Blissey, Chansey, and Ferrothorn depending on which set it runs.</p> "

        "name": "Calm Mind",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Judgment is Arceus-Fairy's most powerful attack, with boosts from both STAB and Pixie Plate solidifying its necessity. Calm Mind allows Arceus-Fairy to boost both its Special Attack and Special Defense so that it can break through offensive teams more easily. Recover provides longevity for Arceus-Fairy so that it can't be whittled down by repeated attacks. Earth Power gives Arceus-Fairy the ability to hit Primal Groudon and Mega Gengar for maximum damage. Fire Blast is Arceus-Fairy's best option to hit Celesteela, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory, even OHKOing the latter two after a single Calm Mind. It also is Arceus-Fairy's best option to hit Necrozma-DM; however, this still requires boosts to do substantial damage. Flamethrower is another option over Fire Blast for improved accuracy, but it gives Arceus-Fairy an even harder time against Celesteela and Necrozma-DM.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed EVs with a Timid nature allow Arceus-Fairy to outspeed Mega Rayquaza and Speed tie with opposing Arceus formes. Maximum HP investment gives Arceus-Fairy the ability to survive a Choice Band-boosted Dragon Ascent from Mega Rayquaza while also allowing it to take on Marshadow and Zygarde better. Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy can instead run a spread of 108 Def / 148 SpA / 252 Spe with a Timid Nature to have a 98.8% chance to 2HKO opposing support Arceus formes after a single Calm Mind while still being able to take a Choice Band-boosted Dragon Ascent from Mega Rayquaza, but sacrificing overall bulk usually isn't worth it. Pixie Plate boosts Judgment slightly, whereas any other item would make Arceus and Judgment Normal-type.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to remove Arceus-Fairy's defensive switch-ins like Necrozma-DM before setting up, as Arceus-Fairy is unable to reliably break it. Use Arceus-Fairy to switch into Pokemon it checks, such as Marshadow and Zygarde, if required before potentially setting up late-game. Play carefully around Shadow Tag users, using Calm Mind when necessary. Even though Mega Gengar can't break through Arceus-Fairy after multiple uses of Calm Mind, it can still use Taunt, Disable, or Destiny Bond to ensure that Arceus-Fairy is removed. Avoid getting hit by Toxic or Thunder Wave, as these status conditions can make Arceus-Fairy a lot less effective for the remainder of the match.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Offensive checks to Necrozma-DM and Primal Groudon such as Life Orb Yveltal and Swords Dance Arceus-Ground make for great teammates, as they allow Arceus-Fairy to sweep more easily late-game. Necrozma-DM appreciates having Arceus-Fairy as a team member due to its ability to cover Yveltal and Arceus-Dark efficiently, whereas Necrozma-DM can switch in on Arceus-Poison and multiple common Steel-types to aid Arceus-Fairy. Primal Groudon is also an effective teammate, dealing with Steel- and Poison-types that force Arceus-Fairy out and with Pokemon that can overwhelm Arceus-Fairy with special moves, such as Primal Kyogre and Geomancy Xerneas. Arceus-Rock or Tyranitar can be used to reliably check Ho-Oh, which walls Arceus-Fairy. Calm Mind Arceus-Fairy appreciates having entry hazard support to sweep more easily. Stealth Rock from Primal Groudon or a support Arceus forme is extremely beneficial to have. A setter of Spikes is also very useful; however, it may be difficult to fit due to its limited distribution. Mega Rayquaza can remove many of the Steel-types that can switch in on Arceus-Fairy while also dealing with Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh relatively well.</p> "

  "Arceus-Ground": {
    "overview": "<p>While several Arceus formes do well in the Anything Goes metagame due to their general versatility, solid base 120 stats across the board, and effectiveness in both their offensive and defensive sets, Arceus-Ground is one of the best due to it superb typing that allows it to switch into and force out common Ground-, Poison-, and Steel-types such as Primal Groudon, Zygarde-C, Arceus-Poison, Mega Gengar, and Necrozma-DM. Offensively, Arceus-Ground's coverage options of Stone Edge for Ho-oh and Ice Beam for Zygarde-C and Mega Rayquaza complement its Ground-type STAB attacks well, and its access to excellent setup moves such as Calm Mind and Swords Dance furthers its set diversity. In fact, Arceus-Ground's set diversity allows it to take on a number of roles, with each having a different list of checks and counters, which can make it difficult to initially switch into. Arceus-Ground's versatility is also attributed to the fact that it's hard to distinguish what type it is from Team Preview. However, every Arceus-Ground set is susceptible to Toxic from users such as Ho-oh and Primal Groudon. Furthermore, Gothitelle is also able to trap and remove support and Calm Mind variants of Arceus-Ground from play, potentially breaking the team's structural core. Some Pokemon that Arceus-Ground should otherwise have no problem switching into and checking are able to run mixed or fully special sets such as Primal Groudon and Ultra Necrozma, meaning in actuality Arceus-Ground has a shaky matchup versus some of the Pokemon it's trying to check. Prevalent Flying-types such as Ho-Oh and Celesteela also can easily switch into Arceus-Ground depending on the specific coverage move it has for them. Finally, special attackers such as Primal Kyogre and Geomancy Xerneas can also capitalize on its relative passivity.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Arceus-Ground could play a dedicated lead role, as its access to Stealth Rock and Magic Coat and its Ground typing allow it to beat most opposing dedicated leads such as Smeargle and Excadrill. Toxic can be utilized over Defog on support Arceus-Ground sets if the team already has another entry hazard remover. Such a set can pressure Steel-types such as Arceus-Steel and Necrozma-DM from coming in, as they aren't safe switch-ins to Judgment either. Toxic variants of Arceus-Ground are also notably able to cripple Ho-Oh and Lugia. However, even if Arceus-Ground does pack Toxic, the only Steel-types that would purposefully switch into it would be Celesteela and Skarmory, and they are immune to Judgment. Toxic is also way more situational than Defog. Gravity can be utilized over Stone Edge or Ice Beam to leave Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Celesteela, and Skarmory susceptible to Arceus-Ground's STAB attacks. However, Gravity's limited turns of use make it an inconsistent option and the aforementioned Pokemon can switch out anyway. One notable partner for Gravity Arceus-Ground is Mega Gengar, which greatly appreciates the secondary effect of lowering every Pokemon's evasion by two stages during Gravity's effect, allowing it to use Hypnosis more reliably. Refresh may seem like an interesting choice on Arceus-Ground considering how detrimental being induced with Toxic is for all of its sets. However, Arceus-Ground generally doesn't have room for such an option, as taking away its coverage moveslots would allow Ground-immune Pokemon to come in more freely. Thunder can be utilized over Ice Beam on Calm Mind sets and nails Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Skarmory, Celesteela, and Primal Kyogre. However, Ground + Electric's neutral coverage is nowhere near as vast coverage as Ground + Ice's, which is further hampered by Thunder's inaccuracy. An Adamant nature can be utilized over Jolly for higher damage output on Sticky Web teams, allowing Swords Dance Arceus-Ground to break Pokemon such as Zygarde-C and support Arceus formes more easily. Recover is also usable on Swords Dance Arceus-Ground to perform the role of a bulky setup sweeper.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Lugia: Lugia is the most reliable answer to Arceus-Ground, as its immense bulk, Multiscale, and access to reliable recovery via Roost allow it to easily tank multiple Ice Beams, Thunders, and Stone Edges. In fact, Lugia's only worry is the extremely rare Toxic variant of support Arceus-Ground, as it cannot alleviate its Toxic status on its own and will be unable to get back to Multiscale range.</p> <p><strong>Celesteela and Skarmory</strong>: Celesteela and Skarmory are able to check Arceus-Ground due to their immunity to Judgment and Earthquake, neutrality to Stone Edge and Ice Beam, and access to recovery options in Leech Seed + Protect and Roost. Meanwhile, Celesteela and Skarmory are able to put Arceus-Ground on a timer with Toxic and, in the case of Skarmory, either set up entry hazards or phaze Arceus-Ground with Whirlwind. However, neither Celesteela nor Skarmory can stay in against Thunder variants of Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, and Celesteela additionally cannot beat Substitute + Swords Dance Arceus-Ground.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Water-types such as Primal Kyogre, Arceus-Water, and Choice Scarf Kyogre all threaten to eliminate Arceus-Ground with their respective STAB attacks. Arceus-Water can even Perish trap Arceus-Ground with the combination of Whirlpool + Perish Song, and Choice Scarf Kyogre can fish for the OHKO with Sheer Cold. However, it should be noted that Primal Kyogre cannot switch into Swords Dance variants after they have already gotten to +2, that Arceus-Water generally only defeats support variants of Arceus-Ground, and that Choice Scarf Kyogre gets easily worn down over time, which lessens the power of its STAB Water Spout.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh: Similarly to Lugia, Ho-Oh is another huge threat to Arceus-Ground, as it can wall both support and Calm Mind sets with relative ease and either afflict it with Toxic status or attack it with Sacred Fire and Brave Bird. However, Ho-Oh cannot take on Swords Dance variants, as they tend to run Stone Edge, which OHKOes Ho-Oh.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey</strong>: Support and Calm Mind variants of Arceus-Ground are not capable of breaking Chansey or Blissey due to their extremely high HP and Special Defense stats. Chansey and Blissey, however, can put Arceus-Ground on a timer with Toxic and restore their health with Soft-Boiled. Swords Dance variants of Arceus-Ground can swiftly take care of them, however, as their Defense stats are pitiful.</p> <p><strong>Marshadow</strong>: Marshadow outspeeds Arceus-Ground and can use Spectral Thief against it to OHKO Swords Dance sets after stealing one boost and a bit of prior chip damage or stop Calm Mind sets from sweeping the opposing team.</p> <p><strong>Gothitelle</strong>: Gothitelle can trap both support and Calm Mind variants of Arceus-Ground due to its naturally high base Special Defense, heavy Special Defense investment, and support Arceus-Ground's passivity. However, Gothitelle does not have the raw, natural physical bulk to be able to take on Swords Dance variants.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Judgment is Arceus-Ground's strongest attack, super effectively threatening Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM. Defog allows Arceus-Ground to support teammates such as Ho-Oh and Yveltal by removing entry hazards for them. Arceus-Ground in particular is a great Defog user, as it not only resists Stealth Rock, but also beats common Stealth Rock users, such as Primal Groudon, defensive Necrozma-DM, and Arceus-Poison, one-on-one and forces them out. Ice Beam is fantastic coverage for Arceus-Ground, as it can hit Flying- and Dragon-type Pokemon such as Mega Rayquaza, Vivillon, and Zygarde-C whereas Judgment would have dealt nothing or very little. Ice Beam also gives Arceus-Ground nearly perfect neutral coverage in tandem with Judgment. Alternatively, Will-O-Wisp can cripple physical attackers such as Mega Rayquaza, Marshadow, and offensive Necrozma-DM, allowing Arceus-Ground to more reliably check these threats and for its teammates.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>252 HP and 240 Defense EVs are utilized to increase Arceus-Ground's bulk, allowing it to take on common physical attackers such as Arceus and Ultra Necrozma. Maximum defensive investment also enables Arceus-Ground to withstand strong physical attackers such as Marshadow and Choice Scarf Mega Rayquaza. In return, Arceus-Ground can either cripple Marshadow and Mega Rayquaza with Will-O-Wisp or heavily dent them with Judgment or Ice Beam. 16 Speed EVs allow Arceus-Ground to outspeed maximum Speed neutral-natured variants of Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre. Alternatively, a spread of 252 HP / 160 Def / 96 Spe alongside a Timid nature allows Arceus-Ground to outspeed Adamant Mega Rayquaza and below.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Due to its heavy defensive investment, Arceus-Ground can switch into a multitude of physical threats such as Necrozma-DM, Primal Groudon, and Marshadow and threaten to either hit them hard with STAB Judgment or burn them with Will-O-Wisp and neutralize them as a threat. Be wary around the former two, as Necrozma-DM could be Calm Mind Ultra Necrozma and Primal Groudon could be a specially offensive, mixed, or Toxic-inducing set. Arceus-Ground's presence and set diversity can force Pokemon such as Necrozma-DM to switch out. These generated free turns can be used to Defog away entry hazards for Arceus-Ground's teammates. Arceus-Ground must be wary of being afflicted with Toxic by Pokemon such as Ho-Oh and opposing support Arceus formes, especially since support Arceus-Ground cannot do much back. Therefore, Arceus-Ground should be switched out into a teammate that can capitalize on the passivity of these checks, such as Calm Mind Arceus-Rock and Zygarde-C. Support variants of Arceus-Ground tend to be quite passive, allowing threats such as Geomancy Xerneas and Calm Mind Primal Kyogre free turns to set up, so playing more aggressively by double switching to Arceus-Ground's offensive teammates would help further momentum.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Pokemon susceptible to Stealth Rock such as Mega Rayquaza and Ho-Oh greatly appreciate the Defog support Arceus-Ground provides. Toxic-immune Pokemon, such as Mega Gengar, and Steel-types, such as Necrozma-DM, Celesteela, and Arceus-Steel, make fantastic partners with support Arceus-Ground, as they can prevent it from being worn down over time. Answers to Ho-Oh such as Zygarde-C and Arceus-Rock also make great teammates with support Arceus-Ground, as Ho-Oh can otherwise easily tank an Ice Beam and either use Toxic or Brave Bird to wear support Arceus-Ground down. Answers to Primal Kyogre such as Primal Groudon and Ferrothorn pair great with Arceus-Ground, as Primal Kyogre is one of its most common checks and takes advantage of support Arceus-Ground's passivity. Arceus-Water is also a good partner for support Arceus-Ground, as Grass-types are also few and far between, and together they can check non-Toxic variants of Primal Groudon reliably.</p> "

        "name": "Swords Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Earthquake is Arceus-Ground's most reliable physical STAB option, plowing through Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Arceus-Poison. Stone Edge nails Flying-types such as Ho-oh, Yveltal, and Vivillon that are immune to Earthquake. Substitute shields Arceus-Ground from Toxic and Leech Seed users, such as Celesteela, support Arceus formes, and Ferrothorn, while also generating free turns to set up with Swords Dance whenever Arceus-Ground is safely behind a Substitute. Substitute is also notable for racking up Defense drops on Mega Rayquaza as it breaks each Substitute with Dragon Ascent. Extreme Speed is another decent option if you need a form of priority and is 100% accurate compared to Stone Edge's shaky accuracy. However, even at +2 Attack, Extreme Speed is relatively weak, especially compared to other priority moves, though it does help revenge kill threats such as Deoxys-A.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Groundium Z turns Earthquake into Tectonic Rage, which allows Arceus-Ground to pick up important KOs such as the chance to OHKO defensive Zygarde after Stealth Rock at +2 Attack and the chance to OHKO Primal Kyogre after Stealth Rock without a boost. Earth Plate can also be used if the team has another chosen Z-Move user. A Jolly nature is preferred when using Swords Dance Arceus-Ground on a balance offense team to Speed tie opposing maximum Speed Arceus formes.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Arceus-Ground should wait until the most opportune time to set up with Swords Dance, as it generally doesn't utilize Recover and therefore only has one shot to sweep. Usually, this happens late-game when all of the Pokemon on the opposing side are weakened and have been chipped away at. However, if given the opportunity, Arceus-Ground should consider what Pokemon remaining on the opponent's side are stopping it from sweeping and determine if breaking holes through the opponent's team by removing something such as Zygarde-C is beneficial to the rest of Arceus-Ground's team. Swords Dance Arceus-Ground should also wait for the most opportune time to utilize Tectonic Rage. Usually from Team Preview, you should have in mind what particular Pokemon on the opponent's side you are going to have to need to save Tectonic Rage for. Because Groundium Z is well known for being more popular than Earth Plate on Swords Dance Arceus-Ground, the opponent might double switch to a Ground-immune or -resistant Pokemon to waste its Z-Move. Be cautious of prematurely wasting Tectonic Rage. Focus on eliminating key threats such as Marshadow, Celesteela, and Skarmory, as they can stop Swords Dance Arceus-Ground's sweep outright if not removed prior.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Swords Dance variants of Arceus-Ground fit best on offensive and hyper offensive teams, so Pokemon such as Ultra Necrozma, Primal Groudon, Smeargle, and Mega Rayquaza make great teammates. Although it cannot switch in, Marshadow is able to outspeed Arceus-Ground, steal its Swords Dance boosts, and eliminate it with Spectral Thief. Marshadow is also immune to Extreme Speed, meaning Arceus-Ground cannot bypass it that way either. Therefore, solid Marshadow answers such as Arceus-Fairy, Zygarde-C, and Xerneas are key to not being counterswept. Mega Gengar is one of the best Mega Evolutions to utilize alongside Swords Dance Arceus-Ground, as it can trap its more passive checks such as Celesteela, Lugia, Chansey, and non-Shed Shell Skarmory. Mega Gengar also has access to Destiny Bond, which allows it to trade one for one to eliminate one of Swords Dance Arceus-Ground's offensive checks, such as Calm Mind Arceus-Water. Specially defensive Primal Groudon is a fantastic teammate for Arceus-Ground, as it can set Stealth Rock, check threats such as Primal Kyogre, threaten to eliminate Skarmory and Celesteela with Overheat, and badly poison support Arceus formes with Toxic, potentially opening windows of opportunity for Arceus-Ground later. Pokemon such as Calm Mind Arceus-Steel are most thankful for Arceus-Ground luring in Pokemon such as Ho-Oh that would otherwise be able to take on support and Calm Mind variants of Arceus-Ground.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind allows Arceus-Ground to showcase its specially offensive presence as well as pick up important KOs such as Necrozma-DM and specially defensive Primal Groudon at +1. Judgment is Arceus-Ground's primary STAB option and, when boosted, allows it to smack neutral targets such as support Arceus-Dark and Ferrothorn hard. Ice Beam allows Arceus-Ground to take on Flying- and Dragon-types such as Vivillon, Yveltal, Arceus-Flying, Mega Rayquaza, and Zygarde-C.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack EVs are utilized to increase Calm Mind Arceus-Ground's overall damage output. Instead of running Special Attack EVs, however, Calm Mind Arceus-Ground can invest more into HP to grant it more setup opportunities. However, it sacrifices a lot of power, and therefore should only be considered when Arceus-Ground is on a balance team. This extra HP investment allows Arceus-Ground to more freely set up on Pokemon such as Zygarde-C and Primal Groudon, although simultaneously Arceus-Ground will need additional Calm Mind boosts to achieve the same damage output as a variant with maximum Special Attack investment instead.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Arceus-Ground should try to set up Calm Mind boosts against Pokemon that can't do much back to it such as non-Dragon Tail Zygarde-C and offensive Arceus-Steel. Calm Mind Arceus-Ground's biggest checks and counters, such as Ho-Oh, Lugia, Celesteela, Chansey, Blissey, and Primal Kyogre, should be heavily damaged or removed before Arceus-Ground attempts to set up and sweep, and therefore it should primarily be reserved for late-game.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Gothitelle is a great teammate, as it's able to trap Celesteela and Chansey and remove them before Arceus-Ground begins setting up with Calm Mind. Primal Groudon is yet another fantastic teammate, as depending on what moves it is running, it can check a multitude of Pokemon Arceus-Ground doesn't like. Sets utilizing both Stone Edge and Stealth Rock are able to pressure Arceus-Ground checks such as Ho-Oh and Primal Kyogre. Sets with Toxic can also cripple Lugia and Ho-Oh. Arceus-Poison and Necrozma-DM are fantastic partners for Arceus-Ground, as they can both set up Stealth Rock for it while still applying offensive pressure and maintain defensive presence. Calm Mind Arceus-Ground dislikes being inflicted with Toxic, so teammates such as Arceus-Poison, Necrozma-DM, and Celesteela that are either immune to Toxic or can cure their own status make great partners. Magearna is a special example, as it can act as a cleric with Heal Bell and remove the status conditions of both Calm Mind Arceus-Ground and its teammates. Calm Mind Arceus-Ground also appreciates entry hazard setters such as Primal Groudon, as chipping the opposing side, namely Ho-Oh, throughout the match is extremely important to Arceus-Ground's success late-game.</p> "

  "Arceus-Poison": {
    "overview": "<p>Arceus-Poison is a premier counter to Fairy-types that can provide fantastic team support by setting or removing entry hazards. While Necrozma-DM and Magearna have their own advantages as Fairy-type counters, Arceus-Poison is unique in that it provides hazard support, has reliable recovery, and has the additional benefit of being able to check both Marshadow and Yveltal. Furthermore, access to Will-O-Wisp ensures that Arceus-Poison will not be setup bait for physical attackers. However, despite the importance of Arceus-Poison's role, it is quite one-dimensional in its usage. It is easily forced out by threats such as Primal Groudon and Ultra Necrozma and is fairly passive, limiting its utility in many scenarios.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Swords Dance set with Poison Jab, Earthquake, and Recover can be run alongside Poisonium Z but is greatly outclassed as an offensive Xerneas check by Swords Dance variants of Necrozma-DM and as a sweeper by other Arceus formes. A set with Calm Mind / Sludge Bomb / Earth Power or Fire Blast / Recover can be used, but it is generally inferior to Calm Mind Arceus-Steel as a poison-immune Calm Mind Arceus forme due to its poor offensive typing. A specially oriented set with Sludge Bomb or Judgment can deal a bit more damage than Poison Jab can but fails to OHKO Geomancy Xerneas. Flamethrower or Fire Blast can be used to hit Ferrothorn and Celesteela, but Will-O-Wisp is generally enough to hinder those Steel-types. Toxic can cripple incoming switch-ins but leaves Arceus-Poison unable to touch Steel-types at all, making it inferior to Will-O-Wisp in most cases. Whirlpool and Perish Song can be used to trap support Arceus formes that switch into Arceus-Poison, but this is very situational and generally hard to pull off.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Primal Groudon, Arceus-Ground, and Zygarde-C can easily switch into any of Arceus-Poison's moves and threaten it out with their STAB attacks. However, Zygarde-C dislikes being burned, while Primal Groudon and Arceus-Ground do not appreciate poison.</p> <p><strong>Ultra Necrozma: Ultra Necrozma can easily switch in on Poison Jab and OHKO Arceus-Poison with Photon Geyser, but it has to watch out for Will-O-Wisp if it is physical.</p> <p><strong>Mega Gengar</strong>: Mega Gengar can easily trap Arceus-Poison with the combination of Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, and Hex, but must watch out for Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind Arceus Formes</strong>: Calm Mind Arceus formes, including Arceus-Dark, Arceus-Rock, Arceus-Steel, and Arceus-Ground, take minimal damage from Poison Jab and are only forced out by Perish Song.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Attackers: Powerful attackers such as Choice Band Ho-Oh and Primal Kyogre avoid the 2HKO from Poison Jab and can 2HKO back with their STAB attacks, but they should be wary of Acid Downpour.</p> <p><strong>Burns: Burns greatly limit Arceus-Poison's ability to deal reasonable damage and may inhibit its ability to check Geomancy Xerneas.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Poison Jab is Arceus-Poison's primary attack of choice that can hit Fairy-types hard and has the added benefit of a poison chance to cripple switch-ins. Will-O-Wisp neuters opposing physical attackers, especially Mega Rayquaza and Necrozma-DM, preventing Arceus-Poison from becoming setup bait. Stealth Rock is generally the best support move of choice, as it can be set on many common Defoggers in the metagame such as Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Water. Defog can be used if the team requires a Defogger but is usually inferior due to the fact that Arceus-Poison is countered by Primal Groudon, the most common Stealth Rock setter in the metagame. If neither Stealth Rock nor Defog is necessary, Earth Power can be used to 2HKO Mega Gengar even with a Special Attack-lowering nature and hit Primal Groudon for more damage. Finally, Perish Song is an option to hinder the sweeps of opposing Calm Mind + Refresh Arceus formes.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>248 HP EVs combined with 8 Defense EVs and 148 Special Defense EVs allow Arceus-Poison to survive both Psyshock and Psychic from +2 Geomancy Xerneas even after Stealth Rock damage. 96 Speed EVs alongside a Jolly nature allow Arceus-Poison to outspeed Adamant Mega Rayquaza and burn it with Will-O-Wisp or hit it with Acid Downpour. Poisonium Z is the preferred item, since it enables Arceus-Poison to OHKO Geomancy Xerneas along with 8 Attack EVs, but a Toxic Plate can suffice if the Z-Move is required elsewhere. However, Perish Song is preferred with Toxic Plate, as Arceus-Poison is unable to OHKO Xerneas and may lose to Psyshock or Psychic variants.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Arceus-Poison should be brought in freely on Fairy-types such as Arceus-Fairy and Xerneas to fire off Poison Jabs, set Stealth Rock, or remove hazards with Defog. If Arceus-Poison is needed to check Yveltal or especially Life Orb Marshadow, be sure to keep it healthy. Try not to keep it in for too long, as its passiveness can give opportunities to Calm Mind Arceus formes for set up. Be sure to scout for Ultra Necrozma before attempting to burn Necrozma-DM; Photon Geyser easily OHKOes Arceus-Poison. Furthermore, while Life Orb Marshadow struggles to break past Arceus-Poison, Bulk Up variants with Marshadium Z will OHKO Arceus-Poison at +1 after minimal chip damage, so be wary when trying to check it. Mega Gengar should be played around carefully, as Arceus-Poison is easily trapped and removed if lacking Earth Power.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Many Pokemon that fear Xerneas or Arceus-Fairy such as Mega Rayquaza, Yveltal, and Marshadow appreciate Arceus-Poison's ability to absorb opposing Fairy-type STAB moves. In addition, Tyranitar and Marshadow can Pursuit trap Mega Gengar for Arceus-Poison. Checks to Ground-types are necessary, so Arceus-Ground and Primal Kyogre make good teammates. Arceus-Dark can help by checking Ultra Necrozma, while Zygarde-C counters Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon lacking Hidden Power Ice.</p> "

  "Arceus-Rock": {
    "overview": "<p>Arceus-Rock's typing and good stats make it a premier check to the tier's Flying-types, including Mega Rayquaza variants that are Choice-locked or lack Earthquake, Yveltal, Ho-Oh, and Vivillon. It's notably one of the few Stealth Rock setters and Calm Mind Arceus formes that can beat Ho-Oh. Arceus-Rock differentiates itself from Tyranitar, the other relevant Rock-type in Anything Goes, with its high Speed, access to instant recovery, and support options like Will-O-Wisp, which allow it to reliably handle mixed variants of Mega Rayquaza. Rock also isn't awful as a standalone attacking type, hitting many of Arceus-Rock's offensive checks like Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre for neutral damage. However, Arceus-Rock's typing leaves it with numerous weaknesses to common offensive types. As a result, common Pokemon like Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Necrozma-DM, and Marshadow can easily force it out, and Pokemon like Mega Rayquaza can elect to run coverage moves in order to get past it. Tyranitar competes heavily with Arceus-Rock for its defensive niche. The former can also check Mega Rayquaza, and its secondary Dark typing and access to Pursuit give it an edge against threats like Mega Gengar. Tyranitar also has the ability to hold items like Shuca Berry, which lets it check Earthquake variants of Mega Rayquaza, whereas Arceus-Rock has a restricted item slot. Arceus-Rock tends to give away momentum rather easily, as there will always be a number of Pokemon that wall it depending on its set. Such Pokemon include support Arceus formes it it lacks Toxic or Calm Mind + Refresh, Steel-types if it lacks Fire Blast, and Zygarde-C if it lacks Ice Beam. As a Calm Mind user, Arceus-Rock is usually outclassed by other Pokemon such as Arceus-Fairy, Arceus-Ground, and Ultra Necrozma, which have better defensive typings that give them an easier time setting up.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Defog is an option over Stealth Rock on the support set if your team desperately needs it. However, Arceus-Rock loses to most entry hazard setters including Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, and support Arceus formes, so it's a subpar option. Fire Blast and Ice Beam can be used to hit Steel-types and Zygarde-C, respectively, which otherwise fear little from Arceus-Rock besides Will-O-Wisp.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Ground-types resist Arceus-Rock's Judgment and threaten it with their super effective STAB moves. Support Arceus-Ground can use Defog as Arceus-Rock is forced out, while Calm Mind variants can use Arceus-Rock as setup fodder; Swords Dance Arceus-Ground doesn't like being burned, but once safely in, it can use Substitute to dodge Will-O-Wisp. Defensive Zygarde-C can use Rest to shrug off burns, letting it completely shut down Arceus-Rock. Primal Groudon can easily OHKO Arceus-Rock with Precipice Blades, and support variants are usually able to avoid the 3HKO from Judgment and recover their health with Rest. However, Arceus-Rock can cripple Zygarde-C lacking Rest with Will-O-Wisp, and Primal Groudon is a shakier switch-in to Arceus-Rock due to its lack of resistance to Judgment.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Arceus-Steel, Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, and Magearna can usually wall Arceus-Rock with impunity thanks to their solid bulk and resistance to Judgment. However, Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn are greatly annoyed by Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre: Primal Kyogre's massive special bulk lets it easily switch into Arceus-Rock when healthy, and it can either OHKO Arceus-Rock with Origin Pulse or use the opportunity to set up Calm Mind boosts.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types</strong>: Marshadow and Mega Mewtwo X can easily OHKO Arceus-Rock with their attacks; Marshadow can also take advantage of Arceus-Rock if it's running a Substitute + Bulk Up set. However, it's extremely risky for them to switch in, since Arceus-Rock can cripple them with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage: Moves like Earthquake and Surf from Mega Rayquaza, Focus Blast from Mega Mewtwo Y, and Sunsteel Strike from Ultra Necrozma severely damage Arceus-Rock.</p> <p><strong>Support Arceus Formes: Support Arceus formes like Arceus-Water, Arceus-Fairy, and Arceus-Dark don't really mind burns, and they can use Defog to remove the Stealth Rock Arceus-Rock sets or use Toxic to put it on a timer. Arceus-Rock can't do much back to them unless it's running Toxic or Calm Mind + Refresh, and in the latter case they can still cut its sweep short via Perish Song or Roar.</p> <p><strong>Shadow Tag Users: Since Arceus-Rock only runs one attacking move, Mega Gengar can trap and dispose of it with a Substitute + Disable set. Alternatively, it can 2HKO Arceus-Rock with Focus Blast or boosted Hex or force a trade with Destiny Bond. Gothitelle traps support Arceus-Rock and neutralizes it by using Confide and PP stalling Judgment.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Chansey: Arceus-Rock is completely walled by Blissey and Chansey, which usually run Confide, allowing them to beat the Calm Mind + Refresh set.</p> <p><strong>Status Conditions</strong>: Status totally cripples Arceus-Rock, greatly compromising its ability to check the Pokemon it's supposed to and making it even more of a momentum drain by forcing it to use Recover more often. Some Pokemon that Arceus-Rock is supposed to check like Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Choice Scarf Mega Rayquaza often carry Toxic. Arceus-Rock can overcome status if it's running Refresh, however.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Judgment allows Arceus-Rock to threaten Yveltal and Ho-Oh, OHKOing the former after Stealth Rock damage and the latter from full health. It also hits some of Arceus-Rock's switch-ins, like Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre, for decent chip damage. Recover keeps Arceus-Rock healthy throughout the game, letting it consistently check the Pokemon it needs to. Will-O-Wisp cripples physical attackers like Necrozma-DM and Marshadow that would otherwise happily switch into Arceus-Rock and allows it to beat Mega Rayquaza more consistently. Stealth Rock allows Arceus-Rock to take advantage of the switches it forces. While Arceus-Rock has a favorable matchup against some Defoggers like Ho-Oh and Yveltal, support Arceus formes with Toxic are very common Defoggers that can beat it. Perish Song enables Arceus-Rock to deal with Baton Pass strategies and puts other setup sweepers like Extreme Killer Arceus, Calm Mind Arceus formes, and Vivillon on a timer. Roar phazes these setup sweepers more quickly and may also catch Gothitelle off guard. However, the next time it manages to trap Arceus-Rock, Gothitelle can just use Taunt to prevent Arceus-Rock from using Roar. Toxic can be run over Stealth Rock or Will-O-Wisp to hit Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and support Arceus formes. However, forgoing Will-O-Wisp makes Arceus-Rock complete bait for Steel-types.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP investment improves Arceus-Rock's bulk, letting it serve as a solid defensive check to the likes of Ho-Oh and certain Mega Rayquaza variants. Maximum Speed investment is essential to outspeed Mega Rayquaza so that Arceus-Rock can use Recover or Will-O-Wisp before the latter attacks. Arceus-Rock also appreciates Speed tying with other Arceus formes. 4 Special Defense EVs ensure that Arceus-Rock avoids the 2HKO from Choice Scarf Yveltal's Dark Pulse after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Use Recover frequently to keep Arceus-Rock healthy. For example, Arceus-Rock should generally use Recover after it switches into Dragon Ascent from mixed variants of Mega Rayquaza, as otherwise it will be unable to switch in safely the next time. Keep in mind that some Pokemon Arceus-Rock is supposed to check may run coverage moves to hit it. For example, Mega Rayquaza can easily overwhelm it with Earthquake, Surf, or Choice Band-boosted Outrage, while Choice Scarf Ho-Oh can 2HKO it with Earthquake after Stealth Rock damage. Arceus-Rock should avoid Toxic at all costs from Pokemon like support Arceus formes and from foes it's supposed to check like Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and Mega Rayquaza at all costs, as poison status will greatly hinder its ability to check the threats it's supposed to. Depending on the matchup, it may not be too necessary to utilize prediction with Arceus-Rock. Many of its offensive checks like Primal Groudon take neutral damage from Judgment, and others such as Necrozma-DM and Marshadow are severely crippled by burns or lack reliable recovery. Therefore, Arceus-Rock can simply use Judgment in order to attack what's in front of it and use Will-O-Wisp if the opponent opts to switch to a slower physical attacker. Keep in mind, however, that it will be forced out by faster threats like Marshadow and Ultra Necrozma if it doesn't use Will-O-Wisp as they switch in. Stealth Rock can be used as a form of insurance against Defoggers that Arceus-Rock fails to threaten, like support Arceus formes. After using Stealth Rock, you can switch to an offensive threat like Mega Rayquaza or Necrozma-DM, forcing the opponent to choose between using Defog and giving you a free switch and punishing your switch and not removing your entry hazards. Revealing Arceus-Rock's typing as late as possible can be beneficial, since the opponent won't realize there's a downside to using moves like Dragon Ascent with Mega Rayquaza.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Support Arceus-Rock fits on balanced and bulky offense teams that want security against Flying-types like Mega Rayquaza. Note that it should be incorporated into teams that need it, rather than built around. Mega Rayquaza covers many of Arceus-Rock's weaknesses in Ground, Fighting, and Water. It also can be a decent pivot into Pokemon like Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre and puts a lot of pressure on defensive Pokemon such as support Arceus formes and Steel-types that wall Arceus-Rock. Alternatively, Mega Sableye can check Marshadow and Ultra Necrozma for Arceus-Rock and bounce back entry hazards and status from passive Steel-types like Ferrothorn and support Necrozma-DM. Ho-Oh covers Arceus-Rock's Ground, Fighting, and Steel weaknesses, making it a natural partner. It can easily switch into Calm Mind Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Steel, two of the biggest offensive threats to Arceus-Rock, and check Primal Groudon, Marshadow, and most support Arceus formes as well. Celesteela and Skarmory have fantastic defensive synergy with Arceus-Rock. Arceus-Rock can deal with Fire-types like Ho-Oh that trouble them, while they cover its Ground- and Steel-type weaknesses. Celesteela can deal with Calm Mind Arceus-Ground and Calm Mind Arceus-Steel, as well as other Arceus formes that annoy Arceus-Rock, while Skarmory provides Spikes support and can reliably deal with support and Swords Dance variants of Arceus-Ground and Necrozma-DM. Either of them in tandem with Arceus-Rock can collectively wall Mega Rayquaza with accurate prediction, as they can handle Earthquake variants and take Choice Band-boosted Outrage, while Arceus-Rock can deal with V-create variants. Primal Groudon pressures many of Arceus-Rock's checks, including Primal Kyogre and Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, and appreciates Arceus-Rock's ability to switch in to Ho-Oh and Yveltal. Running Stealth Rock on Arceus-Rock also frees up Primal Groudon to run a more offensive set. Ferrothorn can stack entry hazards alongside Arceus-Rock, as it can force out most support Arceus formes while Arceus-Rock can beat Ho-Oh. It provides a strong check to Primal Kyogre for Arceus-Rock and greatly appreciates Arceus-Rock's ability to deal with Ho-Oh. Arceus-Fairy and Xerneas can deal with Marshadow and Zygarde-C for Arceus-Rock, and they appreciate it wearing down a shared check in Primal Groudon and crippling Steel-types with Will-O-Wisp. Once Necrozma-DM has been burned, Arceus-Fairy can potentially sweep with a Calm Mind + Refresh set. Various other support Arceus formes pair well with Arceus-Rock. Arceus-Ground can check Primal Groudon, Zygarde-C, and Steel-types for Arceus-Rock, and it appreciates Arceus-Rock's ability to deal with Ho-Oh. Arceus-Water can also take on these attackers and serve as a pivot into Primal Kyogre. Arceus-Poison provides a Toxic immunity and can take on Marshadow thanks to its Fighting-type resistance. Mega Gengar and Gothitelle can be good partners, as they can trap and dispose of common checks to Arceus-Rock including support Arceus formes and passive Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Celesteela. Once these checks have been removed, Arceus-Rock will be able to wear down the opposing team more easily with the combination of Will-O-Wisp and Judgment and keep its Stealth Rock up if the opponent's Defogger has been eliminated.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Calm Mind lets Arceus-Rock slowly overwhelm foes like support Arceus formes and makes it harder to revenge kill for special attackers.

Refresh allows Arceus-Rock to consistently switch into and set up on Pokemon like Ho-Oh, Yveltal, and support Arceus formes that cannot punish it outside of status. Recover extends Arceus-Rock's longevity and allows it to set up on most foes that can't 2HKO it.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP investment improves Arceus-Rock's bulk so that, in addition to its role of a sweeper, it can serve as a solid defensive check to Pokemon like Ho-Oh and Mega Rayquaza.

Arceus-Rock also appreciates Speed tying with other Arceus formes. 4 Special Defense EVs ensure that Arceus-Rock avoids the 2HKO from Choice Scarf Yveltal's Dark Pulse after Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Arceus-Rock is best used to sweep late-game once its offensive and defensive checks have been removed. It can also be used early- to mid-game to check Pokemon like Ho-Oh and Mega Rayquaza and to absorb status moves. Be aware that some Pokemon Arceus-Rock is supposed to check often run coverage moves to hit it. For example, Mega Rayquaza can muscle past it with Earthquake, Surf, or Choice Band-boosted Outrage, while Ho-Oh can hit it with Earthquake. Be wary of handing over free turns to defensive Pokemon early-game. For example, Steel-types like Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn can switch into this set with impunity and proceed to set entry hazards or, in Ferrothorn's case, annoy Arceus-Rock's teammates with Leech Seed. It may be necessary to play aggressively and make double switches to teammates that can threaten these Pokemon. Don't attempt to sweep if faster revenge killers like Marshadow and Ultra Necrozma are still alive. Instead, Arceus-Rock should spam Judgment or use Calm Mind only as necessary to break through the threat it's currently facing. Revealing Arceus-Rock's typing as late as possible can be beneficial, since the opponent won't realize there's a downside to using moves like Dragon Ascent with Mega Rayquaza and may be more willing to let checks such as Necrozma-DM get weakened.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>This set fits on balanced and bulky offense teams looking for a late-game sweeper that can also provide some security against Flying-types like Mega Rayquaza and act as a status absorber. Mixed variants of Mega Rayquaza can shred through Steel-types and Zygarde-C, allowing Arceus-Rock to sweep much more easily. Alternatively, Mega Sableye can check Marshadow and Ultra Necrozma for Arceus-Rock and bounce back entry hazards from passive Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and support Necrozma-DM. Ho-Oh is an excellent defensive partner because it covers Arceus-Rock's Ground-, Steel-, and Fighting-type weaknesses and can shut down passive Steel-types that attempt to take advantage of it. Celesteela and Skarmory have fantastic defensive synergy with Arceus-Rock; Arceus-Rock can deal with Fire-types like Ho-Oh that trouble them, while they cover its Ground- and Steel-type weaknesses. Celesteela can deal with Calm Mind Arceus-Ground and Calm Mind Arceus-Steel, as well as other Arceus formes that annoy Arceus-Rock, while Skarmory provides Spikes support and can reliably deal with support and Swords Dance variants of Arceus-Ground and Necrozma-DM. Either of them in tandem with Arceus-Rock can collectively wall Mega Rayquaza with accurate prediction, as Skarmory and Celesteela can handle Earthquake variants and take Choice Band-boosted Outrage, while Arceus-Rock can deal with V-create variants. Primal Groudon pressures many of Arceus-Rock's checks, including Primal Kyogre and Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and appreciates Arceus-Rock's ability to switch in to Ho-Oh and Yveltal. Ferrothorn provides a strong check to Primal Kyogre and provides Spikes support to facilitate Arceus-Rock's sweep. It greatly appreciates Arceus-Rock's ability to reliably deal with Ho-Oh. Arceus-Fairy and Xerneas can deal with Marshadow and Zygarde-C for Arceus-Rock, and they appreciate it wearing down a shared check in Primal Groudon. Arceus-Fairy can also lure in support Necrozma-DM and cripple it with Will-O-Wisp, allowing this set to use it as setup fodder. Various other support Arceus formes pair well with Arceus-Rock. Arceus-Ground can check Primal Groudon, Zygarde-C, and Steel-types for Arceus-Rock, and it appreciates Arceus-Rock's ability to deal with Ho-Oh. Arceus-Water can also take on these attackers and serve as a pivot into Primal Kyogre.</p> "

  "Arceus-Steel": {
    "overview": "<p>Arceus-Steel is one of the most threatening Calm Mind sweepers in the metagame. An immunity to Toxic thanks to its Steel typing allows it to run coverage in Earth Power or Thunder instead of Refresh, and solid resistances including Flying and Fairy combined with its great bulk make it a decent switch-in to threats such as Mega Rayquaza and Arceus-Fairy. Solid coverage with Judgment and Earth Power enables Arceus-Steel to hit the entire metagame neutrally aside from Ho-Oh, Celesteela, and Skarmory, the latter two of which it can beat anyway. As Ho-Oh is extremely rare on hyper offense and generally uncommon on bulky offense, Arceus-Steel has a great matchup against offensive teams, which generally have to rely on offensive checks such as Choice Scarf Mega Rayquaza and Marshadow. Furthermore, Arceus-Steel finds numerous setup opportunities by switching into Pokemon such as Arceus-Fairy, Arceus-Poison, and Choice Scarf Xerneas freely thanks to its fantastic defensive capabilities, offering both offensive and defensive utility to a team. However, Arceus-Steel is often dead weight against teams with Ho-Oh unless it is running Thunder and Stealth Rock is up. Additionally, Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh can take any +1 hit and OHKO Arceus-Steel. It is also susceptible to being revenge killed by Pokemon such as Marshadow and Choice Scarf Mega Rayquaza, and other Pokemon with high Special Defense such as Primal Kyogre and Confide Blissey can be tough for Arceus-Steel to break through.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Swords Dance with Steelium Z and a moveset of Iron Head / Swords Dance / Stone Edge / Extreme Speed can act as a good lure for Ho-Oh and catch opponents off guard. However, Calm Mind is much more threatening and can get past more Pokemon. Roar over Earth Power is a decent option to beat other Calm Mind sweepers such as other Arceus formes and Primal Kyogre. However, this set loses out on important coverage. A set of Judgment / Recover / Toxic / Stealth Rock can be a decent support Arceus, but Arceus-Steel's typing is generally ineffective in this role, as it loses to Marshadow and can be OHKOed by Mega Rayquaza. It also has almost no advantages over Necrozma-DM, which handily checks Xerneas. Lastly, Iron Defense over Earth Power can allow Arceus-Steel to set up on Ho-Oh without Whirlwind, Primal Groudon without Roar, and other physical attackers. However, like Roar, it gives up important coverage and doesn't help with Marshadow.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon generally wall Arceus-Steel. Ho-Oh's Regenerator and access to Recover make it much more difficult to break through, especially without Thunder. Primal Groudon can be overcome with Earth Power and has no access to recovery but can OHKO Arceus-Steel or set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Marshadow and Choice Scarf Mega Rayquaza can OHKO Arceus-Steel with Close Combat and V-create, respectively. They can either switch in on a predicted Calm Mind and force Arceus-Steel out or come in after a teammate has been KOed. Ultra Necrozma can also inflict massive damage with Earthquake and OHKO Arceus-Steel after some chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre: Primal Kyogre's immense special bulk allows it to take almost nothing from everything except Thunder. It can also deal massive damage to Arceus-Steel, even when Arceus-Steel is at +1 Special Defense, and use Arceus-Steel to set up Calm Mind of its own.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: Chansey and Blissey's insane special bulk allow them to wall Arceus-Steel completely. They also run Confide to prevent Arceus-Steel from setting up on them.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Recover gives Arceus-Steel the longevity needed to easily set up against Pokemon such as Arceus-Fairy, Arceus-Poison, and Arceus lacking Earthquake and shrug off most hits from them. Earth Power is useful coverage mostly for Primal Groudon, doing solid damage to it at +1, and also hits opposing Steel-types such as Necrozma-DM. Thunder is an option over Earth Power that allows Arceus-Steel to bypass Ho-Oh and Primal Kyogre, OHKOing the former after Stealth Rock at +1. However, its shaky accuracy against Ho-Oh and complete inability to touch Primal Groudon make Earth Power preferable in most situations.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment gives Arceus-Steel a lot of power with Calm Mind boosts, allowing it to hit notable benchmarks such as the OHKO against Mega Rayquaza at +1 after Stealth Rock and the 2HKO against support Arceus formes with +1 Judgment.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Arceus-Steel should utilize its resistances and immunities to freely switch into Pokemon like Arceus-Fairy, Arceus-Poison, Arceus-Rock, and Mega Sableye and set up with Calm Mind. Predicting an opponent's switch to Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, or Ho-Oh and hitting it with the appropriate coverage move can weaken it for Arceus-Steel to easily sweep later. Arceus-Steel can act as a pivot against Mega Rayquaza on more offensive teams, but it should be careful of Dragon Dance and coverage attacks such as V-create. It can also act as a solid switch-in to Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Mega Rayquaza and Xerneas for teammates such as Ultra Necrozma and Zygarde-C. Since Arceus-Steel is indefinitely walled by Ho-Oh, attempt to get rid of it before setting up with Arceus-Steel. On the same note, try to set up Stealth Rock before attempting to sweep; notably, Stealth Rock allows Arceus-Steel to OHKO Mega Rayquaza with +1 Judgment and Ho-Oh with +1 Thunder. On offensive teams, playing aggressively with Arceus-Steel and its teammates can open doors for it to sweep. For example, double switching to Mega Rayquaza on a predicted Chansey switch-in can allow an offensive team to break through a defensive one.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Arceus-Steel can fit on most bulky offensive and hyper offensive teams, since its Steel typing provides a good buffer for status and allows it to act as a pivot into threats like Mega Rayquaza. It is also a huge threat to offensive teams, since it is very hard to switch into without Ho-Oh. Stealth Rock setters such as Primal Groudon and suicide leads like Excadrill can be useful to weaken Ho-Oh and threats such as Mega Rayquaza. Primal Groudon also acts as a switch-in to Primal Kyogre, which can set up on Arceus-Steel. Primal Kyogre can also be a good teammate to aggressively switch in on Ho-Oh and Primal Groudon, forcing them out or removing them for Arceus-Steel to sweep. Mega Rayquaza is a fantastic partner for Arceus-Steel, since it can threaten all of Arceus-Steel's defensive checks in Ho-Oh, Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, Chansey, and Blissey. Arceus-Steel can also switch into most of Mega Rayquaza's checks, such as Arceus-Rock and Arceus-Fairy. More defensively, support Arceus formes like Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Ground can switch into Marshadow and Choice Scarf Mega Rayquaza, which easily revenge kill Arceus-Steel. In general, most offensive Pokemon work well with Arceus-Steel in breaking down both defensive and offensive teams. Examples include Mega Rayquaza, Primal Kyogre, Bulk Up Marshadow, and Swords Dance Arceus formes.</p> "

  "Arceus-Water": {
    "overview": "<p>Arceus-Water is a solid pick in the Anything Goes metagame due to its good defensive typing in Water, great bulk, access to reliable recovery, and ability to check many dangerous threats, notably Primal Groudon and offensive Necrozma-DM. It can also soft check many other threats such as Zygarde-C, Marshadow, Arceus, and Mega Rayquaza. These valuable qualities make Arceus-Water really useful on balanced teams, which otherwise typically lack defensive countermeasures to mixed Primal Groudon and better pivots into Primal Kyogre. However, Arceus-Water is notably passive; although Water is a good defensive typing, offensively it is resisted by many common Pokemon such as Mega Rayquaza and Primal Groudon. This makes Arceus-Water largely dependent on status to punish opposing Pokemon, which can exploited by setup sweepers like Calm Mind Ultra Necrozma and defensive Pokemon resistant to status like Giratina. It also suffers from four-moveslot syndrome, often having to forego a support or coverage move, which leaves it unable to harm certain threats it would normally check such as Necrozma-DM if it doesn't opt for Judgment and Mega Rayquaza if it doesn't opt for Ice Beam or Will-O-Wisp. Lastly, Arceus-Water is vulnerable to being trapped by Shadow Tag users, notably Gothitelle and, if it lacks Judgment, Mega Gengar.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Liquidation can be used with an Impish or Relaxed nature to deal more damage to Calm Mind Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Steel. It also lets Arceus-Water avoid getting trapped by Confide Gothitelle. However, Judgment deals more damage to the vast majority of Steel-types and can be used with Ice Beam without needing to run a Relaxed nature, making Judgment more consistent. Waterium Z is a another option that can be used with Liquidation, as the Z-Move can heavily damage threats such as Calm Mind Arceus-Ground and Primal Kyogre.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Defensive Steel-types: With their Toxic immunity, resistance to Ice Beam, and good overall bulk, defensive Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Necrozma-DM, Magearna, and Celesteela can switch into Arceus-Water and punish it with Toxic, or by setting entry hazards in Ferrothorn and Necrozma-DM's case. Arceus-Water can try to wear down them with Judgment, but it will usually fail, since these Pokemon have access to recovery. However, Steel-types can be annoyed by Will-O-Wisp, which makes it more difficult for them to heal, especially in the case of Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Shadow Tag Users: Both Gothitelle and Mega Gengar can trap Arceus-Water and remove it in different ways. Gothitelle PP stalls it with Confide + Rest, while Mega Gengar can use Substitute + Disable to prevent the use of Judgment and then use Perish Song or an offensive move to take out Arceus-Water. However, Mega Gengar strongly dislikes switching into Judgment.</p> <p><strong>Toxic: Toxic makes Arceus-Water more susceptible to being picked off by powerful moves such as +1 Dragon Ascent from Life Orb Mega Rayquaza and forces it to use Recover more often.</p> <p><strong>Other Status-resistant Foes: Arceus-Water is mainly dependent on status to punish bulky Pokemon and struggles with those that are resistant to it thanks to Rest, Regenerator, Magic Bounce, and Natural Cure such as Giratina, Ho-Oh, Mega Sableye, Chansey, and Blissey, which can also punish Arceus-Water return with Toxic. Giratina is especially notable with Defog and Pressure to ensure that Stealth Rock Arceus-Water is unable to keep Stealth Rock up. Arceus-Steel and Calm Mind + Refresh Arceus formes can also set up on Arceus-Water without risk. Finally, Arceus-Poison is able to pressure it with status from Poison Jab while being immune to Toxic, letting it set Stealth Rock against Defog sets.</p> <p><strong>Primal Kyogre: Primal Kyogre resists Judgment and Ice Beam and can threaten to 2HKO Arceus-Water back with Thunder. Even without Thunder, Primal Kyogre can break through Arceus-Water with the combination of Calm Mind and Origin Pulse if it's faster or completely wall Arceus-Water with Rest and Toxic. However, Arceus-Water can use its resistances to Water- and Ice-type moves to switch into Primal Kyogre before pivoting out to a more appropriate check such as Primal Groudon.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Special Attackers: Arceus-Water is mainly invested in Defense and relies on its typing to take on special attackers. Powerful special attackers that can hit it neutrally, such as Geomancy Xerneas, Calm Mind Lunala, and Calm Mind Arceus formes, can often 2HKO Arceus-Water and potentially set up on it.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Recover is mandatory to keep Arceus-Water healthy, while Toxic is very a important move to punish bulky Pokemon such as Primal Kyogre, Primal Groudon, and support Arceus formes, which aren't really threatened by any other move. Ice Beam is primarily an offensive move, hitting many offensive Pokemon such as Mega Rayquaza, Yveltal, and Zygarde-C for super effective damage. However, Will-O-Wisp is a very viable option and can be used over Ice Beam to neutralize physical attackers such as Mega Rayquaza, Necrozma-DM, Marshadow, and Extreme Killer Arceus, making them easy to take on for the rest of the team. Judgment is an aggressive way to hit Steel-types, mainly offensive Necrozma-DM, and it also 2HKOes Ho-Oh and Mega Gengar, which both check Arceus-Water otherwise. Arceus-Water is a decent user of Stealth Rock thanks to the good role compression it provides and its ability to beat Defog Arceus-Ground, a trait that is relatively rare in common Stealth Rock setters. Defog can be considered instead of Judgment to remove entry hazards. However, in addition to the fact that Steel-types like specially defensive Necrozma-DM and Ferrothorn are completely free to switch back in to set entry hazards, Arceus-Water struggles to consistently remove Stealth Rock against Primal Groudon even with a type advantage versus it due to the popularity of Toxic on the latter, making Defog a subpar option.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>16 Speed EVs allow Arceus-Water to outspeed neutral-natured base 90 Speed Pokemon, notably Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre. 252 HP and 240 Defense EVs maximize Arceus-Water's physical bulk, allowing it to survive powerful moves such as +2 Searing Sunraze Smash from Necrozma-DM and +1 Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike from Marshadow and giving it a good chance to survive +1 Dragon Ascent from Life Orb Mega Rayquaza. Alternatively, a spread of 252 HP / 160 Def / 96 Spe with a Timid nature allows Arceus-Water to outspeed Adamant Mega Rayquaza and anything below.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Thanks to heavy defensive investment, this set can switch into many physical attackers like offensive Necrozma-DM, Primal Groudon, Zygarde-C, and Marshadow and punish them with the appropriate coverage or status move. Arceus-Water should use Toxic against bulky foes such as Primal Groudon as soon as possible to punish them over the match, while Recover should be used often to ensure that Arceus-Water can still check common Pokemon like offensive Necrozma-DM, Marshadow, and Primal Groudon. Use Ice Beam and Judgment only against foes they hit super effectively or, in Judgment's case, against Steel-types that lack both recovery and Toxic. Otherwise, it is often better to use Toxic or switch out to an appropriate teammate. If running Will-O-Wisp, keep in mind that your opponent can scout for it by pivoting to Pokemon like Calm Mind Arceus formes, which Arceus-Water will lose the ability to threaten with Toxic, before sending in a Pokemon that dislikes Will-O-Wisp like offensive Necrozma-DM. In general, avoid unnecessarily revealing Will-O-Wisp. If running Stealth Rock, setting it on Pokemon forced out by Arceus-Water, like support Arceus-Ground, is ideal. Finally, Defog variants of Arceus-Water should not be played passively, so try to use Toxic on opposing entry hazard setters, notably Primal Groudon, before attempting to Defog.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Because Arceus-Water is passive, it should be mainly used on balance and stall teams where its defensive qualities are appreciated, unlike on offensive teams where its passivity is an undesirable trait to have. Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh are good teammates for Arceus-Water; Primal Groudon can set Stealth Rock, phaze Geomancy Xerneas with Roar, and pivot into Thunder from Primal Kyogre, while Ho-Oh provides Defog support and checks Pokemon that both Arceus-Water and Primal Groudon struggle against, like Calm Mind Arceus-Ground and Lunala. Both Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh can threaten potentially problematic Steel-types, especially Ferrothorn, with their STAB Fire-type attacks, and they appreciate Arceus-Water's ability to pivot into Primal Kyogre, Zygarde-C, most Mega Rayquaza sets, and opposing Primal Groudon. Mega Gengar is a great teammate for Arceus-Water due to its ability to threaten opposing defensive cores, which are highly problematic for Arceus-Water, thanks to Shadow Tag and various tools at its disposal like Taunt, Perish Song, Substitute, a Toxic immunity, and its sheer power. In return, Mega Gengar appreciates Arceus-Water handling bulky foes such as Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Zygarde-C, which can all take powerful attacks from Mega Gengar and KO it back. Arceus-Water has good synergy with Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Necrozma-DM, Celesteela, and Magearna due to its ability to provide a safe switch-in to Primal Groudon, support Arceus-Ground, and Zygarde-C. In return, Steel-types can switch into Toxic and provide various utility options; Necrozma-DM and Magearna also check Geomancy Xerneas. Ferrothorn can check Primal Kyogre and almost all viable support Arceus formes, and its Spikes support is appreciated by nearly every team. Necrozma-DM can provide Stealth Rock support or, with an Ultranecrozium Z set, wallbreak to weaken defensive cores that Arceus-Water struggles against. Celesteela provides an additional measure of security against Dragon Dance Mega Rayquaza and Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, both of which can overpower Arceus-Water. Magearna checks Life Orb Yveltal and Vivillon and provides momentum with Volt Switch for Arceus-Water's team. Finally, Dark-types such as Yveltal, Arceus-Dark, and Tyranitar can switch into Ghost- and Dark-types like Lunala and Yveltal for Arceus-Water. Both Yveltal and Arceus-Dark can run Defog to remove entry hazards, and Tyranitar can set Stealth Rock. Tyranitar is particularly notable for its ability to Pursuit trap Mega Gengar and Gothitelle, which greatly helps out Arceus-Water. In return, Arceus-Water can check Primal Groudon, Zygarde-C, and Marshadow for it.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Excadrill is a great suicide lead for hyper offensive teams due to its decent Speed, access to Rapid Spin, and ability in Mold Breaker, which lets it set up Stealth Rock against Magic Bounce users. Toxic and Rapid Spin allow Excadrill to beat opposing leads such as Shuckle and Arceus-Fairy by crippling them with Toxic and removing their entry hazards. However, due to its shallow movepool, Excadrill is quite predictable and can be easily outplayed by leading Pokemon that can easily beat it such as Zygarde and faster Pokemon that can shut it down with Taunt. This leaves Excadrill only viable on hyper offensive teams, as balanced and defensive teams prefer Pokemon such as Skarmory that can easily clear away hazards with Defog and more bulky Stealth Rock setters such as Ferrothorn.</p> ",

Rapid Spin clears entry hazards from Excadrill's side of the field, allowing it to match up nicely against other lead Pokemon. Rock Tomb lets Excadrill hit Flying-type Pokemon like Ho-Oh for super effective damage while also lowering the foe's Speed. This allows it to soft check setup sweepers that rely on Speed boosts such as Dragon Dance Mega Rayquaza and support teammates such as Vivillon that appreciate slower foes. Toxic can cripple walls like defensive Arceus formes and offensive setup sweepers such as Geomancy Xerneas and pressures Defoggers by crippling their ability to switch in through the battle to clear hazards. Earthquake prevents setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Arceus from using Substitute to safely set up. However, using Earthquake means that Excadrill can't cripple setup sweepers such as Arceus-Ghost with Toxic.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Attack and Speed EVs alongside a Jolly nature allow Excadrill to hit as hard as possible and outspeed Pokemon such as Modest Yveltal and Adamant Primal Groudon. A Focus Sash allows Excadrill to survive any one attack, nearly guaranteeing that it can set up Stealth Rock or get off a Toxic. Mold Breaker gives Excadrill an advantage over other leads by letting it set up Stealth Rock against Magic Bounce Pokemon such as Espeon on Baton Pass teams and Mega Sableye.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Excadrill should mostly be used as the lead Pokemon to almost guarantee it setting Stealth Rock. This also allows Excadrill to cripple threats such as Primal Groudon with Toxic before they can set up. When using Excadrill, decide carefully whether getting up hazards or removing them is more important. If there is a Pokemon on your opponent's team that can clear hazards easily against a majority of your Pokemon, then Excadrill should prioritize removing hazards over setting up Stealth Rock. Mold Breaker lets Excadrill badly poison all Pokemon that aren't Poison- or Steel-type, which helps it against other entry hazard setters and removers and lets it win the hazard war. Excadrill should slow down offensive setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Primal Groudon with Rock Tomb, allowing faster teammates to revenge kill them with more ease. If the opponent has a bulky Defogger such as Arceus-Water or Giratina, it should not try to set up Stealth Rock until after they are gone. Against potentially faster Pokemon that can lead against Excadrill, such as Choice Scarf Yveltal, it is better to just set up Stealth Rock rather than trying to slow them down with Rock Tomb.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Setup sweepers and wallbreakers such as Dragon Dance Mega Rayquaza, Geomancy Xerneas, and Ultra Necrozma appreciate Excadrill's ability to clear entry hazards from the field, set up Stealth Rock to cripple their checks such as Skarmory and Ho-Oh, and badly poison defensive Pokemon such as Lugia for them. Since Excadrill's main purpose is to set up Stealth Rock, it enjoys teammates such as Marshadow and Arceus-Ghost that can act as spinblockers as well as Defog users such as Yveltal that have a decent matchup against other lead Pokemon. Pokemon such as Arceus-Ground and Primal Groudon appreciate Excadrill's ability to set up Stealth Rock, allowing them to run another coverage move. Vivillon appreciates Excadrill's ability to spin away Stealth Rock and lower the foe's Speed stat with Rock Tomb, allowing it to easily get off a Sleep Powder and then proceed to set up. Taunt users such as Yveltal and Mega Gengar are able to stop Defog users such as Arceus-Water from clearing Excadrill's hazards. Fast Taunt users like Yveltal benefit from Excadrill's Rock Tomb, as after one Rock Tomb they can outspeed and Taunt Defog users such as support Arceus formes. Other Pokemon such as Ultra Necrozma and Eruption Primal Groudon make great teammates for Excadrill, as they can beat most Defog users. Choice Scarf Pokemon such as Xerneas can revenge kill threats such as Mega Rayquaza.</p> "

Aside from that, Gothitelle also traps different entry hazard removers across the tier, notably most Defog Arceus variants, as well as Choice-locked Pokemon like Choice Scarf Yveltal locked into Oblivion Wing and Choice Scarf Xerneas situationally. Despite all of this, Gothitelle offers nothing defensively to a team other than trapping a few Pokemon, often making it awkward to fit onto a build.

Taunt stops Gothitelle from being inflicted with Leech Seed by the likes of Celesteela and Ferrothorn and phazed by Arceus formes and Ho-Oh and forces the trapped foe to use attacking moves to speed up the trapping process.

Leftovers helps Gothitelle's longevity while also making it less vulnerable to critical hits and Leech Seed. Maximum HP and Special Defense investment with a Calm nature gives Gothitelle more bulk to trap support Arceus and potentially allows it trap Choice Scarf Xerneas.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Once you stall a foe out of its PP, send in a Pokemon on your team that can take advantage of the situation, which is especially useful for removing or setting up entry hazards or setting up with a sweeper. Patience is important when using Gothitelle. Figure out your opponent's sets before trying to PP stall so you can form a game plan. Also, be aware of the possibility of getting critical hits and getting frozen during a PP stall, so try to use Rest with Gothitelle to stay out of range of a critical hit from the Pokemon you are trapping. Try to force Gothitelle's trapping targets in with its teammates and proceed to catch the target with Gothitelle by conditioning your opponent into switching the target in. Be wary of the possibility of Z-Crystals on support Arceus, as these sets attempt to avoid getting trapped by Gothitelle. If facing a team with a Pursuit trapper, namely Marshadow, Tyranitar, or Alolan Muk, aim to play conservatively with your Gothitelle to avoid getting trapped. After trapping and removing a foe, Gothitelle can easily be taken advantage of, so try to switch into something that can handle the opposing team better on the last Struggle of the trapped Pokemon. To avoid Roar or Whirlwind being an issue on passive threats such as support Arceus formes, non-Shed Shell Skarmory, and Lugia, it's important to Rest immediately following a Taunt when low on health, as this prevents the Pokemon from phazing while Gothitelle is asleep.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Setup sweepers that like to see support Arceus gone such as Bulk Up Marshadow, Swords Dance Ultra Necrozma, Dragon Dance Zygarde-C, and Dragon Dance Mega Rayquaza all benefit from having Gothitelle alongside them to free them up offensively. Gothitelle enjoys a defensive core around it to make up for its vulnerability to powerful physical attackers. Zygarde-C, Skarmory, and Celesteela do that well. Reliable entry hazard setters can take advantage of Gothitelle's ability to trap a lot of viable Defoggers, so Stealth Rock Arceus variants and Ferrothorn fit that role. Pivoting in the form of Yveltal or Magearna can also be helpful for Gothitelle's trapping.</p> "

In addition to this, Ferrothorn's access to Spikes, Stealth Rock, and a myriad of other viable support moves makes it very useful as a support Pokemon, capable of being fit on many defensive archetypes. However, unlike other defensive Pokemon, Ferrothorn is crippled by its lack of reliable recovery. Due to this, Ferrothorn is forced to rely on Leech Seed and Leftovers to regain its health. It also bears a massive 4x weakness to Fire and 2x weakness to Fighting, meaning that common threats in Primal Groudon, Ho-Oh, and Marshadow force it out easily. Additionally, many Pokemon can run Fire-type coverage and effectively deal with Ferrothorn as well.</p> ",

Chople Berry provides a way for Ferrothorn to survive Marshadow's Close Combat, but Ferrothorn generally doesn't want to stay in on Marshadow regardless, and it really needs the passive recovery that Leftovers provides. Shed Shell allows Ferrothorn to escape from Shadow Tag users Gothitelle and Mega Gengar, but Leftovers is almost always a better item. Thunder Wave can be used to impair support Arceus formes; however, these Pokemon would usually be better dealt with using Toxic.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ho-Oh: Ferrothorn has a hard time impairing Ho-Oh without inflicting a status ailment via Toxic or Thunder Wave and hence generally doesn't appreciate Ho-Oh's presence on opposing teams. Stealth Rock can be used to deter Ho-Oh from switching in repeatedly; however, Ho-Oh can switch in when Stealth Rock is being set and Defog immediately, making it unmanageable for Ferrothorn.</p> <p><strong>Primal Groudon</strong>: Primal Groudon can switch into any of Ferrothorn's attacks without taking much damage and OHKO it in return with any Fire-type attack. While Primal Groudon doesn't like being badly poisoned if Ferrothorn opts to run Toxic, it frequently runs Rest and can avoid eventually falling to residual damage.</p> <p><strong>Marshadow</strong>: While it doesn't appreciate switching into Gyro Ball or Power Whip, Marshadow can OHKO Ferrothorn with Close Combat. Marshadow can also set up with Bulk Up against Ferrothorn to simultaneously weaken Ferrothorn's attacks and boost its own Attack stat.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye</strong>: Mega Sableye walls Ferrothorn completely. Mega Sableye is too slow for Gyro Ball to do significant damage, and Power Whip can't even 2HKO specially defensive variants. Mega Sableye can also impair Ferrothorn for the remainder of the match using Will-O-Wisp or Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Mega Rayquaza</strong>: Mega Rayquaza has no issues with Ferrothorn, as many sets that forgo V-create can still OHKO with Dragon Ascent. Mega Rayquaza doesn't appreciate switching into Gyro Ball, however.</p> <p><strong>Gothitelle</strong>: By repeatedly using Charm and Taunt, Gothitelle can eliminate Ferrothorn from the match without much effort.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind Arceus formes</strong>: Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Steel can both repeatedly set up with Calm Mind against Ferrothorn while shrugging off anything Ferrothorn can do. Other Arceus formes like Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Ground can also set up against Ferrothorn provided it lacks super effective coverage.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Coverage: Arceus formes, Celesteela, and Ultra Necrozma can run Fire-type coverage to avoid being walled by Ferrothorn; however, this is very often inferior to other coverage.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Setup Sweepers: Necrozma-DM and Zygarde-C are both able to take repeated attacks from Power Whip and Gyro Ball while setting up Swords Dance and Dragon Dance, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Taunt: Ferrothorn is unable to perform most of its functions by solely using attacks and thus is usually forced out if hit by Taunt.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Leech Seed enables Ferrothorn to slowly regain health throughout the match without solely relying on Leftovers in addition to slowly wearing down opposing Pokemon. Gyro Ball is Ferrothorn's strongest means of attacking, allowing it to deal large amounts of damage to threats that don't resist it. Power Whip is better against Kyogre; however, it is otherwise much worse than Gyro Ball, since it can't deal substantial damage to Mega Gengar, Mega Rayquaza, and Vivillon. Spikes provides useful utility by dealing substantial damage to aid setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Mega Rayquaza, Geomancy Xerneas, and Swords Dance Necrozma-DM. Stealth Rock can be used instead of Spikes if Ferrothorn's team lacks a setter. Protect gives Ferrothorn an extra turn of recovery from Leech Seed and Leftovers. Toxic can be used over Protect to impair Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh switch-ins, but Protect is often preferred due to how often Ferrothorn's health is paramount to the outcome of a match.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Special Defense investment paired with a Sassy nature gives Ferrothorn maximum special bulk to efficiently check Kyogre and support Arceus formes. 0 Speed IVs are run to increase Gyro Ball's power. A Careful nature should be used instead if Gyro Ball isn't used. Leftovers allows Ferrothorn to regain health passively throughout the course of the match to aid with longevity. Iron Barbs provides another way for Ferrothorn to damage opposing Pokemon, as any contact moves that are used against Ferrothorn will deal damage to the user.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Keep Ferrothorn healthy during the course of the match by using Leech Seed generously, especially if there is a Kyogre still remaining in the game. Feel free to switch into Kyogre, Lugia, Skarmory, and support Arceus formes to capitalize on their inability to deal sufficient damage to Ferrothorn and attempt to regain health via Leech Seed. Set up multiple layers of Spikes when opposing Pokemon are unable to deal substantial damage to Ferrothorn. Be wary with moves such as Gyro Ball, as their PP may run out before opposing threats are effectively dealt with. Use Iron Barbs to inflict damage against physical attackers such as Extreme Killer Arceus and defensive Yveltal if necessary; however, Ferrothorn should not be used as a sole check to these Pokemon. If using Toxic, use it liberally to weaken Pokemon that can remove entry hazards. Be wary of Ferrothorn becoming setup fodder against Pokemon like Ultra Necrozma and Zygarde-C, as they can capitalize on Ferrothorn's passiveness and set up without much hassle. Scout for Fire-type coverage from support Arceus formes to prevent Ferrothorn from being OHKOed by an unexpected attack. Avoid letting Ferrothorn get burned, as it cancels out Leftovers recovery and overall makes regaining health difficult.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Zygarde-C is a great partner to Ferrothorn, as it's an effective answer to Ho-Oh, Primal Groudon, and Marshadow, while Ferrothorn can also aid with Zygarde-C's massive weaknesses to Kyogre, Arceus-Fairy, and Xerneas. Arceus-Fairy is another good partner due to its ability to check Marshadow and Yveltal, whereas Ferrothorn is able to put a halt to Primal Kyogre, Celesteela, and support Necrozma-DM, some of Arceus-Fairy's most prevalent answers. Ho-Oh can be paired with Ferrothorn to help with special attackers like Calm Mind Arceus formes and Geomancy Xerneas. Checks to Primal Groudon like Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Water, and the aforementioned Zygarde-C are extremely beneficial to Ferrothorn due to its inability to deal substantial damage to Primal Groudon. Answers to Ho-Oh such as Arceus-Rock, Arceus-Water, and Tyranitar are extremely useful to have due to Ferrothorn's crippling weakness to it. Pokemon that can check Xerneas more reliably than Ferrothorn such as Necrozma-DM and Arceus-Poison are required due to the prevalence of Focus Blast on Geomancy Xerneas sets; Ferrothorn should never be used as a team's sole Xerneas answer. Pokemon that appreciate the support from Ferrothorn's Spikes such as Dragon Dance Mega Rayquaza and Swords Dance Necrozma-DM are good partners due to the number of 2HKOs and OHKOs they can obtain after entry hazard damage. Ferrothorn can also switch into Pokemon that pressure Mega Rayquaza and Necrozma-DM such as Lugia and support Arceus formes. Other Pokemon that appreciate Ferrothorn's ability to switch into Kyogre such as Arceus-Steel and Arceus-Rock are also very good options.</p> "

  "Vivillon": {
    "overview": "<p>Due to the lack of Sleep Clause and viable Sleep Talk users, Vivillon uniquely stands out as a premier sleep inducer and Quiver Dance sweeper, able to take advantage of guaranteed sleep turns to reliably set up Substitutes and Quiver Dances due to Compound Eyes Sleep Powder. However, Vivillon sits in a somewhat awkward Speed tier, leaving it outsped by Yveltal, Mega Rayquaza, Marshadow, Arceus, and Ultra Necrozma before it starts boosting with Quiver Dance. Furthermore, Vivillon is incredibly frail and doesn't have the best defensive typing, so it's 4x weak to the ubiquitous Stealth Rock, doesn't have room in its moveset for a reliable recovery option like Roost, and is picked off fairly easy by priority users such as Arceus, Mega Rayquaza, and Marshadow. This makes it hard for Vivillon to set up, since it needs team support and can only set up against slower foes. Nevertheless, Vivillon is the very definition of a Pokemon in the Anything Goes metagame that can spiral out of control easily if not immediately assessed as a threat, and although it is somewhat niche, it can be a dangerous threat if left unchecked.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Bug Buzz utilizes Vivillon's primary STAB move, is perfectly accurate unlike Hurricane, and nails Psychic- and Dark-type Pokemon such as Mega Mewtwo Y and Arceus-Dark. However, it is important to note that Hurricane is a better option in almost every circumstance.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Having to switch into Stealth Rock is not ideal for Vivillon as it begins to set up and sweep, as it needs as much health as possible to guarantee that it can set up multiple Substitutes and take a priority move if need be.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users</strong>: Strong priority users such as Mega Rayquaza, Marshadow, and Arceus can proactively threaten to KO Vivillon once its Substitute has faded or act as a revenge killers. However, they are all scared of taking a boosted Hurricane.</p> <p><strong>Faster Attackers: Pokemon that exceed the base 90 Speed benchmark such as Arceus-Steel and Mega Gengar can outspeed an unboosted Vivillon and KO it. Mega Mewtwo Y is one of the best examples, as it can switch into a predicted Sleep Powder due to Insomnia.</p> <p><strong>Perish Song Arceus: Certain Arceus formes such as Arceus-Rock, Arceus-Fairy, and Arceus-Poison can utilize Perish Song to force Vivillon to either switch out or be KOed. Their base 120 all-around defensive stats also allow them to withstand a boosted Hurricane or two. However, this is a short-term solution, as Vivillon can easily set up again at another point in time.</p> <p><strong>Status Ailments: Bad poison or paralysis stops Vivillon from performing its role as a setup sweeper. However, inducing Vivillon with status is easier said than done, as most of the time Vivillon will set up a Substitute. Vivillon can also still generate free turns for teammates by putting foes to sleep.</p> <p><strong>Phazers</strong>: Specially defensive phazers such as Primal Groudon, Tyranitar, and Lugia can take a couple of boosted Hurricanes after they have been put to sleep and Roar or Whirlwind Vivillon out when they wake up. However, these Pokemon risk taking a substantial amount of damage and are ultimately last-resort options.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Sleep Powder works well in tandem with Compound Eyes and generates free turns for Vivillon to set up a Substitute and boost with Quiver Dance. Substitute shields Vivillon from status, gives it more opportunities to take advantage of sleep, and most importantly prevents it from being revenge killed after the opposing Pokemon wakes up. Quiver Dance allows Vivillon to outspeed the entire metagame after just two boosts and dish out powerful Hurricanes. Hurricane is Vivillon's strongest STAB move and works well in tandem with Compound Eyes. This is complemented by the fact that Flying is one of the best offensive types in Anything Goes, further cementing Vivillon's place as a great setup sweeper.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Speed EVs alongside a Timid nature allow Vivillon to outspeed a large majority of the metagame to put them to sleep effectively. 136 Defense EVs allows Vivillon to survive several notable priority moves from full, such as Life Orb Mega Rayquaza's Extreme Speed and Life Orb Arceus's Extreme Speed. The remaining 120 Special Attack EVs help make Vivillon a fearsome setup sweeper. Leftovers gives Vivillon a passive recovery option and allows it to set up Substitute multiple times throughout the match. Compound Eyes is the focal point of using Vivillon, as it boosts the accuracy of both Sleep Powder and Hurricane to above 90%, which is crucial for it securing a sweep.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Teammates should try to lay Stealth Rock, Sticky Web, and as many layers of Spikes as possible before you attempt to sweep with Vivillon. Vivillon is quite frail and should try to switch in after a teammate has fainted and the opposing Pokemon is guaranteed to be slower than it. Once brought in against a slower Pokemon such as Zygarde or Primal Groudon, Vivillon should use Sleep Powder to put the opposing Pokemon or its switch-in to sleep. From there, Vivillon can set up a free Substitute and start boosting with Quiver Dance. If the foe wakes up on the second sleep turn and breaks Vivillon's Substitute, use Sleep Powder again to put them back to sleep and set up another Substitute. Remember that there is no Sleep Clause in Anything Goes, so Vivillon can put all of the opposing team to sleep if need be. Once Vivillon has successfully set up six Quiver Dances and its Substitute is still intact, begin firing off super powerful Hurricanes until the opposing team is defeated. However, Vivillon should be wary of priority users such as Arceus and Mega Rayquaza. Marshadow is also a huge threat that must be played around carefully; if Vivillon puts a Pokemon to sleep and then uses Substitute as Marshadow switches in, Vivillon can be KOed by Spectral Thief. Using Quiver Dance over Substitute is optimal if the opponent has a Marshadow lurking in the back. If Vivillon is behind a Substitute, it's generally safe to use Sleep Powder as they break the Substitute. Removing or severely crippling priority users with teammates should be made a top priority if utilizing Vivillon. Stealth Rock is also crucial to remove before Vivillon is brought in and attempts to sweep.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Deoxys-S and Excadrill are two of the best entry hazard stacking leads for the hyper offensive teams Vivillon fits best on. Excadrill has additional utility options such as Rapid Spin to remove Stealth Rock for Vivillon and Rock Tomb to let Vivillon outspeed the foe, put it to sleep, and start boosting with Quiver Dance. Primal Groudon is also notable as another Rock Tomb and Stealth Rock user that can forcibly slow down the foe and create extra opportunities for Vivillon to set up. Dedicated Sticky Web leads such as Shuckle, Smeargle, and Slurpuff can assist Vivillon by slowing down the opposing team, allowing it to put foes naturally faster than it such as Arceus-Dark and Choice Scarf Xerneas to sleep before it sets up the first Quiver Dance. These Sticky Web users are also able to provide additional utility options such as Encore, Stealth Rock, Spore, and Endeavor. Hazard removal from Pokemon such as Arceus-Fairy and Yveltal is a necessity for Vivillon to sweep, increases the likelihood that its sweep will not be interrupted, and is already a fundamental part of teambuilding. Removing Stealth Rock from play also decreases the likelihood that Vivillon will be picked off by opposing priority. Other hyper offensive teammates such as Dragon Dance Mega Rayquaza, Calm Mind Arceus-Steel, Choice Scarf Xerneas, and Double Dance Primal Groudon all appreciate the sleep support and Hurricane chipping Vivillon provides even if its sweep proves unsuccessful.</p> "

  "Yveltal": {
    "overview": "<p>With a good offensive and defensive typing and an extensive movepool, Yveltal is a premier threat in the Anything Goes metagame. A decent base 99 Speed stat allows Yveltal to outspeed the cramped base 90 Speed tier and more, notably getting the jump on Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, bulky Arceus formes, and Zygarde, while also Speed tying with Xerneas. Its other stats are also very well-rounded, allowing it to run a plethora of sets, with good offenses in conjunction with Dark Aura and reasonable defenses allowing it to run defensive sets. Its ability to viably utilize a multitude of sets allows it a degree of unpredictability and forces opponents to proceed with caution. Its STAB combination allows it to beat a large number of Pokemon, like Marshadow, Lunala, and Necrozma-DM. However, Yveltal has a weakness to Stealth Rock, the most common entry hazard in the metagame, meaning that it can be worn down quickly, as well as further weaknesses to Rock and Fairy, which are common offensive types. Its unfavorable matchup against popular picks such as Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Rock means that it will require some team support. Base 99 Speed, while decent, is not enough to outrun some of the biggest threats of the metagame, including Ultra Necrozma, Mega Gengar, Marshadow, and Mega Rayquaza, which means that Yveltal will require a Choice Scarf to outpace these Pokemon. Yveltal is also setup fodder for many Calm Mind Arceus formes and other Pokemon like Xerneas when not using Taunt.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Choice Specs set can be used to pick up many more OHKOs and 2HKOs, notably netting a guaranteed OHKO against offensive Necrozma-DM and a 2HKO against Arceus formes that have not invested in Special Defense. It generally uses Dark Pulse, Oblivion Wing or Hurricane, U-turn, and a coverage move such as Heat Wave or Focus Blast. However, this set suffers from being locked into a move and is sometimes even setup fodder for Pokemon it can force out otherwise, such as Necrozma-DM. Metronome, while less consistent than other boosting items, helps Yveltal break walls better, as the power of its moves is multiplied to up to 2x over time. This is especially useful against defensive Arceus, which may assume that Yveltal does not have a boosting item and attempt to heal all damage with Recover. Yveltal can also utilize a Dread Plate to give its Dark-type moves a boost with no drawbacks, but it has less power than Life Orb or Choice Specs. A set with Darkinium Z or Flyinium Z allows Yveltal to catch foes by surprise, as often they do not expect Yveltal to OHKO a Pokemon from full or almost full health. However, the lack of a boosting item or a Choice Scarf afterward makes Yveltal's job much harder to do. Choice Band is an unexpected item on Yveltal that can let it blow past some of its usual checks like Chansey and Ho-Oh. However, the lack of a reliable physical Flying-type STAB move as well as Knock Off's inability to remove the items from most of the tier make this set less threatening to most foes.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types are able to easily come in on a Dark-type move and OHKO or almost OHKO Yveltal with their STAB attacks. Arceus-Fairy is Yveltal's worst enemy, as it can switch in on any attack and proceed to threaten it out, set or remove entry hazards, or heal itself with Recover. The other Fairy-types in the tier cannot come in safely, as most Xerneas are 2HKOed by Life Orb- or Choice Specs-boosted Oblivion Wing, and Magearna must watch out for Heat Wave.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: If Yveltal is not using Taunt, Tyranitar and Arceus-Dark wall it fairly easily and can either status it or use it as setup fodder for Stealth Rock, Defog, or Calm Mind.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Rock-types, most notably Arceus-Rock, can switch in on a Flying-type attack and also hit Yveltal back hard.</p> <p><strong>Calm Mind Arceus Formes: Calm Mind Arceus Formes can shrug off the majority of Yveltal's attacks with Special Defense boosts and threaten it with their boosted attacks. They do not like taking Toxic, however, and are crippled by Taunt.</p> <p><strong>Ho-Oh</strong>: Defensive Ho-Oh can shrug off all of Yveltal's attacks with Recover and Regenerator, though it must be wary of Taunt. Offensive Ho-Oh can threaten to do heavy damage with Sacred Fire or Brave Bird, but it is 2HKOed by Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey</strong>: Chansey and Blissey take hardly any damage from any special attack from any set, and can easily heal themselves with Soft-Boiled and status Yveltal with Toxic. However, they are shut down completely by Taunt and crippled by Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Attackers</strong>: Pokemon like Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and Mega Rayquaza are able to threaten Yveltal with an OHKO with their high Base Powered moves backed by insane attacking stats. They are all heavily crippled by Dark Pulse or Sucker Punch, though.</p> ",
    "sets": [
      {
        "name": "Life Orb",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dark Pulse is Yveltal's most powerful move, as it is boosted by Dark Aura, STAB, and Life Orb. Oblivion Wing hits almost everything that resists Dark Pulse neutrally, with the added benefit of providing a form of recovery to combat Life Orb recoil. Taunt is used to shut down defensive Pokemon attempting to status Yveltal or heal. It is preferred over Knock Off, as many of the Pokemon in the metagame hold non-removable items. Knock Off can still be used to remove the items of many defensive Pokemon, most notably Chansey's Eviolite. It also removes Mega Rayquaza's item and allows Yveltal to 2HKO offensive Ho-Oh. Sucker Punch gives Yveltal a form of priority, allowing it to finish off foes such as Ultra Necrozma, Marshadow, and Mega Gengar.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack and Speed investment allows Yveltal to hit as hard as possible and outpace base 90 Speed Pokemon and Zygarde. A Rash or Naive nature is chosen to preserve Yveltal's attack if using Knock Off or Sucker Punch. Rash provides a decent Special Attack boost, while Naive allows it to outspeed as much as possible and Speed tie with Xerneas. Life Orb provides a consistent boost to all of Yveltal's attacks at the cost of 10% of its health per attack. Dark Aura provides Yveltal with a moderately large boost to its Dark-type moves. Be aware that Dark-type moves like Arceus-Dark's Judgment and Tyranitar's Pursuit will also do more damage to Yveltal.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Yveltal's primary role is as a wallbreaker that can rip apart defensive cores that rely on status moves. It can also be a good revenge killer if utilizing Sucker Punch. Be advised that your opponent may attempt to predict that you will use Sucker Punch and use a status move. Do not carelessly use the move, and note that Taunt can help ease predictions with it. It is best not to switch Yveltal into powerful attacks, as this will leave it severely crippled and potentially only able to fire off a last few moves due to Life Orb recoil. If there is an opposing defensive threat that Yveltal is needed to break such as Lugia or Giratina, be sure to preserve it and keep it free of status.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM are both great partners, as they can take on Fairy- and Rock-types and appreciate Yveltal's ability to switch into Ground-type attacks. Due to Yveltal's weakness to Stealth Rock, entry hazard removers are essential to preserve its health. A good partner is Arceus-Poison, as it can take on Fairy-types such as Xerneas and act as a secondary check to Marshadow. Yveltal is also immune to both types that Arceus-Poison is weak to and can take on threats that are able to remove Arceus-Poison. Ho-Oh is also helpful as a Defog user, as even though it increases the Rock-type weaknesses on the team, it can help burn foes and badly poison certain Pokemon that Yveltal cannot significantly damage. It also threatens Magearna, which is one of the only viable Pokemon that resist both of Yveltal's STAB types. Hazard setters are very useful, as Yveltal can often force switches with Taunt or by virtue of its typing. Setup sweepers like Extreme Killer Arceus, Bulk Up Marshadow, Dragon Dance Mega Rayquaza, and Double Dance Necrozma-DM appreciate Yveltal's ability to break through many physically bulky Pokemon such as Lugia, Toxapex, Giratina, Mega Sableye, Skarmory, Celesteela, and Zygarde-C. In return, they can wear down Yveltal's checks. Extreme Killer Arceus and Marshadow can also help revenge kill opposing Mega Rayquaza, which heavily threatens Yveltal, and they can help beat Rock-types as well. Yveltal functions well on Sticky Web teams due to its access to Taunt as well as a decent Speed tier, which means that Smeargle and Shuckle are decent partners.</p> "

        "name": "Choice Scarf",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dark Pulse and Oblivion Wing are great STAB options that are boosted by Dark Aura and heal Yveltal, respectively. Foul Play is used on this set because Choice Scarf Yveltal's lack of firepower otherwise makes it hard to KO even offensive threats, and Choice Scarf allows Yveltal to usually use Foul Play before the opponent can attack, turning their own Attack boosts and investment against them. For example, Foul Play can OHKO +2 Swords Dance Arceus-Ground and Choice Band Mega Rayquaza. U-turn allows Yveltal to pivot out of unfavorable matchups, such as against Chansey, and allows a teammate that can force the foe out and do heavy damage to come in. Toxic sets Pokemon that wall Yveltal otherwise, such as support Arceus formes, on a timer. Defog can provide entry hazard removal in a pinch.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum Special Attack investment with a Modest nature gives Yveltal a decent damage output even without a boosting item. Maximum Speed investment coupled with a Choice Scarf allows Yveltal to outpace many threats, notably including Deoxys-A, Mewtwo, Ultra Necrozma, Mega Gengar, Marshadow, and all Arceus formes.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Choice Scarf Yveltal should not focus on wallbreaking, as it does not have the firepower to do so, but instead on revenge killing weakened threats or Pokemon that are weak to one of its STAB types. Paralysis cripples this set far more than any other set, as it essentially negates Yveltal's item while making it even slower and causing it to be fully paralyzed every so often, so it should be avoided unless there is no way to, or if there is a cleric on the team. Using U-turn on foes that Yveltal forces out gains momentum for the team. Think carefully before locking Yveltal into a move, as the wrong choice can cause loss of momentum and force Yveltal out. This is especially true for status moves like Toxic and Defog, as they do not offensively pressure the opponent and can result in Yveltal becoming setup fodder.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Yveltal's lack of firepower makes trappers like Mega Gengar and Gothitelle good teammates, as they are able to remove defensive Pokemon with the combination of Taunt and attacks in the case of the former or PP Stall in the case of the latter, and Yveltal is able to pivot into them and ease prediction with U-turn. Mega Gengar and Gothitelle are notably able to remove support Arceus formes that Yveltal cannot break. Hard hitters like Choice Band Mega Rayquaza and Calm Mind Primal Kyogre go well with this set, as Yveltal is able to keep faster foes in check while they are able to break walls. Mixed Rock Polish Primal Groudon and Swords Dance Necrozma-DM can also take on Pokemon that threaten Yveltal. In return, Yveltal is able to provide U-turn support for them, which often allows them a free turn. Be aware that if using Mega Rayquaza, you are increasing Fairy- and Ice-type weaknesses on the team, as well as stacking a weakness to Stealth Rock. Cleric support from the likes of Aromatherapy Xerneas is greatly appreciated, as the lessened damage output from Oblivion Wing means that Yveltal is not able to heal as much, and removing paralysis is necessary for Yveltal to function as a revenge killer. Entry hazard removal is greatly appreciated, as Yveltal will fall to strong priority after Stealth Rock sometimes. A support Arceus forme is a good fit for this, as it will be able to take powerful hits directed at Yveltal.</p> "

        "name": "Physically Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Foul Play allows Yveltal to hit physical threats hard without the need for investment. Roost provides reliable recovery, allowing it to check threats throughout the game. Taunt helps Yveltal take on other defensive Pokemon such as Blissey and Chansey better, which otherwise wall it easily and can use Toxic on it or a teammate that Yveltal wishes to switch to. Toxic helps wear the foe down, giving Yveltal a way of dealing damage other than Foul Play. Defog provides entry hazard removal for the team, which works well with Yveltal's increased bulk from its defensive investment. Sucker Punch provides priority in a pinch; however, it is quite weak without a boosting item or Attack investment. U-turn allows a teammate a free turn against certain foes and eases prediction when pivoting.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP investment and 180 Defense EVs with a Bold or Impish nature allow Yveltal to stomach physical hits remarkably well, notably allowing it to always tank Mega Rayquaza's Dragon Ascent and retaliate with an OHKO from Foul Play. 80 Speed EVs allow Yveltal to always outspeed Adamant Necrozma-DM. Leftovers provides passive recovery, which Yveltal greatly appreciates, as it is not always able to use Roost. Charti Berry can surprise some foes with Rock-type coverage, like Ultra Necrozma, that expect to OHKO Yveltal, only to be OHKOed in return by Foul Play. Rocky Helmet allows Yveltal to punish contact attackers, which it can make use of to chip Pokemon like Marshadow down without the need to use Toxic. An alternative EV spread of 248 HP / 252 Def / 8 SpD can be used for more bulk at the cost of not outpacing Adamant Necrozma-DM.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Physically defensive Yveltal can switch into any physical attack weaker than Life Orb Mega Rayquaza's Dragon Ascent, taking pitiful damage from common moves like Extreme Speed from Extreme Killer Arceus. If using Rocky Helmet, it is advised to switch into weaker contact moves as much as possible, as that will result in free chip damage on the foe. Use Taunt and Toxic liberally, as that combination is Yveltal's best way to damage the foe. Taunt is especially important, as that will result in the foe being unable to status Yveltal, heal themselves, or use Refresh. Avoid being hit by Toxic at all costs, as it will cut into Yveltal's longevity and force it to use Roost in less-than-ideal situations.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As avoiding Toxic is important, cleric support is a great benefit to defensive Yveltal. Chansey is particularly good for this role, as it can take on special attackers that may trouble physically defensive Yveltal. If Yveltal is not using Defog, entry hazard removal support is important to ensure that Yveltal can consistently switch in on powerful attacks. Defensive Ho-Oh is good for this role, as it provides a Fairy-type resistance and can also help take special hits better. If Yveltal must be sacrificed, a revenge killer such as Mega Gengar can guarantee that Yveltal will not faint in vain by removing the Pokemon that knocked out Yveltal. Primal Groudon and Ferrothorn are also helpful as hazard setters and checks to Primal Kyogre and Fairy-types. Necrozma-DM and Arceus-Poison are also very helpful, as they can set hazards, check Fairy-types, and absorb Toxic.</p> "

  "Zygarde": {
    "overview": "<p>Zygarde has numerous positive attributes that make it stand out as one of the premier threats in Anything Goes. Its signature attacking move, Thousand Arrows, hits most relevant Pokemonâ€”including Flying-typesâ€”for at least neutral damage. Access to excellent utility options such as Glare and Dragon Tail lets it punish its checks and makes it very difficult to take advantage of. A solid defensive typing of Ground / Dragon and colossal bulk gained after activating Power Construct buy offensive variants of Zygarde plenty of opportunities to set up and let defensive sets act as a blanket check to many of the tier's most dangerous physical attackers, including Primal Groudon, Marshadow, Ho-Oh, Necrozma-DM, Swords Dance Arceus formes, and some Mega Rayquaza variants. However, Zygarde's offensive presence is rather lackluster even with Attack investment; it typically requires support from teammates or the use of a boosted Z-Move in order to pressure its common checks in support Arceus formes and Fairy-types. Offensive sets face competition from Mega Rayquaza as a setup sweeper, as it offers more immediate firepower, has higher base Speed, and finds setup opportunities on largely the same threats. Zygarde's effectiveness during a match can also vary depending on whether it manages to activate Power Construct or not: base forme Zygarde has only decent bulk, and a smart opponent can play around it so that Zygarde is KOed before Power Construct activates. Nevertheless, Zygarde's versatility and ability to contend against top threats in the metagame make it one of the best Pokemon in the tier.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sleep Talk on the defensive set prevents Zygarde from being wholly passive while it is asleep and can be useful on teams that do not provide cleric support, but Zygarde loses its ability to check setup sweepers. Extreme Speed on the Dragon Dance set gives Zygarde some utility in revenge killing boosted threats like Mega Rayquaza and allows it to pick off weakened Choice Scarf users that attempt to revenge kill it like Xerneas, Yveltal, and Mega Rayquaza. Protect grants Zygarde an extra turn of Leftovers recovery while possibly racking up more residual damage on a foe; the combination of Substitute + Protect can be lethal if Zygarde is paired with a Toxic Spikes setter. Outrage used with Dragonium Z OHKOes opposing Zygarde and Giratina after a Dragon Dance boost and has a slightly higher Base Power than Tectonic Rage, but Fairy-types are commonly used to check Zygarde and Outrage takes up an extra moveslot, making Groundium Z the generally superior option. Coil can be used on the Dragon Dance set to boost Zygarde's defenses, making it even harder for physical attackers to break its Substitute. For example, simply adding 24 Defense EVs ensures that defensive Primal Groudon can never do so once Zygarde is at +1 Defense in its Complete forme. However, forgoing another move for Coil will mean that Zygarde completely lacks an option to punish support Arceus formes. Iron Tail used with Steelium Z deals massive damage to Arceus-Fairy and defensive Xerneas after a Dragon Dance boost, but it does not help with Zygarde's matchup against other threats. A set of Dragon Dance, Thousand Arrows, Thousand Waves, and Rest with a spread of 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 SpD aims to trap passive foes that cannot 4HKO Zygarde with Thousand Waves and then fully set up on them with Dragon Dance. However, it lacks an option to punish the support Arceus formes that tend to switch into Zygarde and force it out with Ice Beam.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Arceus-Fairy and defensive Xerneas are among the best checks to Zygarde, as they can easily withstand its attacks and retaliate with their super effective STAB moves; Xerneas can also heal off the status Zygarde inflicts with Aromatherapy. Offensive sets require at least three Dragon Dance boosts before these Pokemon can be knocked out with Tectonic Rage.</p> <p><strong>Support Arceus Formes</strong>: Support Arceus formes typically run quite a lot of Defense investment and wall Zygarde to no end. Zygarde requires many Dragon Dance boosts before it can start to threaten the likes of Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Water, and Arceus-Dark, and in the meantime, they can retaliate with Ice Beam, neuter it with Toxic and Will-O-Wisp, phaze it with Roar, or put it on a timer with Perish Song. Arceus-Grass gets a special mention, since it resists Thousand Arrows.</p> <p><strong>Other Bulky Pokemon: Giratina, Lugia, defensive Zygarde, and defensive Primal Kyogre can easily withstand a boosted Thousand Arrows from Zygarde. The first two can phaze Zygarde to cut its sweep short, defensive Zygarde can remove its boosts with Haze, and Primal Kyogre can threaten it with Ice Beam. Most of them also carry Rest, so they aren't really bothered by status moves like Glare and Toxic. However, Zygarde can circumvent attempts at phazing with its own Dragon Tail, evade status conditions with Substitute or Rest, and muscle past Giratina and Zygarde with a boosted Devastating Drake.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Choice Scarf users are able to outspeed a +1 Zygarde and revenge kill it; Mega Rayquaza, Xerneas, Yveltal, Kyogre, and Lunala are all notable examples. If Mega Rayquaza has a Speed-boosting nature, it can even outspeed a +2 Zygarde-C. Very fast Pokemon like Mega Mewtwo Y and Deoxys-A can do the same without a boosting item (although the former gets outsped at +1 if Zygarde has not activated Power Construct yet), and they can OHKO Zygarde with Ice Beam. None of these Pokemon really want to switch into Zygarde, however, as they are crippled by Glare.</p> ",

        "name": "Defensive",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Rest is Zygarde's only source of recovery. It has the benefit of removing status incurred from Pokemon like Ho-Oh, defensive Primal Groudon, and Arceus-Poison that cannot otherwise punish Zygarde. Thousand Arrows provides Zygarde with a STAB attack that targets most of the metagame for at least neutral damage and hits important targets like Primal Groudon and Mega Gengar super effectively. Glare paralyzes foes that attempt to switch into Zygarde and force it out; it's also useful for slowing down setup sweepers such as Dragon Dance Mega Rayquaza, allowing teammates to deal with them more easily. Toxic can be used instead of Glare if the residual damage it inflicts is more beneficial for your team; it should be used alongside Coil so that Zygarde can force out bulky Pokemon like Ferrothorn and support Necrozma-DM. The final moveslot gives Zygarde a method of dealing with setup sweepers: Dragon Tail phazes Pokemon that are not Fairy-types or behind Substitute, racks up damage from entry hazards, and prevents Zygarde from being trapped by Gothitelle. Most importantly, it enables Zygarde to handle Dragon Dance Mega Rayquaza more effectively than other options; a paralyzed Mega Rayquaza will still outspeed Zygarde if it's already at +1, and Zygarde will still be overwhelmed by boosted hits if it tries to use Coil alongside a Life Orb variant. Alternatively, Coil boosts Zygarde's Attack and Defense by one stage each, letting it go toe-to-toe with Swords Dance users (including ones behind Substitute) and possibly pull off a late-game sweep once its checks have been weakened or eliminated. Haze is an option that allows Zygarde to deal with Baton Pass teams, opposing Zygarde, and Substitute + Bulk Up Marshadow and possibly waste Xerneas's Power Herb.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum investment in HP and Defense alongside an Impish nature maximizes Zygarde's already impressive physical bulk. This allows it to withstand very strong neutral hits prior to transformation, including +1 Dragon Ascent from Life Orb Mega Rayquaza and +2 Precipice Blades from Primal Groudon, so that it can activate Power Construct. Leftovers provides Zygarde with a source of passive recovery that leaves it less reliant on Rest.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Oftentimes, using Glare or Toxic has the fewest drawbacks. Electric-types are virtually nonexistent in Anything Goes, and Zygarde naturally scares them away along with Steel- and Poison-types, so its status moves can be spammed quite liberally. Use Rest to keep Zygarde healthy and rid it of status; however, do so sparingly unless Zygarde's team provides cleric support, since it will leave Zygarde very exploitable for two turns. Variants with Coil should avoid trying to sweep until revenge killers such as Xerneas and support Arceus formes have been crippled or removed. A healthy Marshadow can also punish the use of excessive Coil boosts with Spectral Thief; this is particularly undesirable if Zygarde is the team's primary switch-in to Marshadow. Finally, Zygarde should be wary of coverage moves like Draco Meteor from Mega Rayquaza, Outrage from Ultra Necrozma, and Hidden Power Ice from Marshadow.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Gengar is a great partner for Zygarde, since it can trap and remove the Fairy-types and support Arceus formes that threaten it. It can also revenge kill threats like mixed Mega Rayquaza and Outrage Ultra Necrozma that are capable of muscling past Zygarde, ensuring that they do not deal further damage to the team. In return, Zygarde can easily switch into Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh for Mega Gengar, and the paralysis it spreads via Glare boosts the power of Mega Gengar's Hex and can potentially buy it free turns to use Substitute. Alternatively, Mega Rayquaza has an easier time breaking through Fairy-types and support Arceus formes once Zygarde lures them in and cripples them with status. It also appreciates Zygarde's ability to threaten Flying-type switch-ins like Arceus-Steel, Tyranitar, and Celesteela. Steel-types possess natural defensive synergy with Zygarde: Celesteela checks Arceus-Fairy, Arceus-Ground, and Choice Scarf Xerneas for it, while Zygarde switches into Fire-types like Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh for Celesteela. Ferrothorn can switch into the majority of support Arceus formes and Primal Kyogre, and it can set Spikes to help wear down Zygarde's grounded checks. Support Necrozma-DM and Magearna perform similar roles, but they also reliably check Xerneas. Arceus-Fairy and Choice Scarf Xerneas make for effective partners, as they can pivot into Dragon-type moves such as Draco Meteor from Mega Rayquaza and provide extra security against Marshadow in case it's running Hidden Power Ice or Substitute + Bulk Up. Xerneas and Magearna also provide cleric support so that Zygarde can wake up quickly after it uses Rest. In return, Zygarde can very easily switch into and take advantage of Fairy-type switch-ins like Arceus-Poison, Necrozma-DM, and Ho-Oh. Arceus-Poison checks Fairy-types and provides extra security against Marshadow in case it's running Hidden Power Ice, while Zygarde can deal with common switch-ins to Arceus-Poison like Steel-types and Primal Groudon. Primal Groudon checks both Primal Kyogre and Xerneas for Zygarde, while Zygarde can check opposing Primal Groudon and some Mega Rayquaza variants. It's worth noting that despite sharing a Ground typing, the two don't stack any type weaknesses. Slow wallbreakers and setup sweepers including Life Orb or Choice Band Mega Rayquaza, Life Orb Yveltal, Calm Mind Primal Kyogre, and Swords Dance Necrozma-DM can take advantage of the paralysis that Zygarde spreads.</p> "

      {
        "name": "Dragon Dance",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Dragon Dance turns Zygarde into an offensive threat by boosting its Attack and Speed by one stage. Thousand Arrows is Zygarde's primary attacking move that hits most relevant Pokemon in the tier for at least neutral damage. Substitute shields Zygarde from status moves like Toxic, Will-O-Wisp, and Leech Seed. It also allows Zygarde to set up on any Pokemon that cannot break its Substitute in one hit; once it's in its Complete forme, this list includes various passive Pokemon such as support Necrozma-DM, Ferrothorn, and Celesteela. Dragon Tail allows Zygarde to circumvent checks such as Giratina, Lugia, and opposing Zygarde that rely on phazing to deal with it, as they will be phazed by Dragon Tail themselves before they can do the same to Zygarde. Glare punishes offensive foes that attempt to switch in and check Zygarde, and paralysis can occasionally give Zygarde a free turn to set up or attack. Toxic is more effective at pressuring bulky foes such as support Arceus formes and Lugia; after Zygarde poisons one of its checks, it can use Substitute repeatedly to stall out Toxic damage on said check until it is in range of being knocked out by Thousand Arrows.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>12 HP EVs ensure that Zygarde survives Life Orb Mega Rayquaza's Dragon Ascent prior to transformation, and they maximize Zygarde's Leftovers recovery in its Complete forme. If Zygarde is holding Groundium Z, they make Zygarde's HP number divisible by four so that Power Construct will activate after two uses of Substitute. 48 Special Defense EVs ensure that Zygarde survives an uninvested Ice Beam from support Arceus formes or Judgment from Arceus-Fairy prior to transformation. 232 Speed EVs allow Zygarde-C to outspeed Mega Gengar after a Dragon Dance boost. The rest of the EVs are placed into Attack with an Adamant nature to ensure that Zygarde hits as hard as possible. Leftovers provides Zygarde with passive recovery, increasing the number of times it can use Substitute and aiding its attempts to stall out foes with Glare or Toxic. Groundium Z allows Zygarde to use Tectonic Rage, which lets it bypass some of its usual checks. At +1, the Z-Move OHKOes Geomancy Xerneas after Stealth Rock damage and takes out defensive Arceus formes after they have been hit by Thousand Arrows.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Zygarde should be brought in via a free switch into Pokemon that it forces out, like Primal Groudon and Necrozma-DM, or passive Pokemon that are unable to break its Substitute, like Ferrothorn and Celesteela. Switching directly into these Pokemon is risky, however, since they can set up or cripple Zygarde with status moves before it can use Substitute. Once Zygarde is safely in, use Substitute initially to scout for status moves or a switch from the opponent; even if the foe is likely to attack, it can still be useful for safely activating Power Construct. After Zygarde is behind a Substitute, it can start setting up if the opponent's Pokemon does not pose a significant threat to it. Alternatively, Glare or Toxic can be used to cripple the opponent's check to Zygarde so that it will be harder to deal with later in the game. Zygarde should not attempt to sweep until its checks and revenge killers have been weakened or removed. Have a plan to deal with support Arceus formes; crippling them with status or setting entry hazards is usually a good idea. Try to secure prior damage on offensive checks like Primal Kyogre and Xerneas, as they can tank a boosted Thousand Arrows from full HP and proceed to OHKO back if Zygarde is not behind a Substitute. Scout for potential Choice Scarf users like Mega Rayquaza, Xerneas, and Yveltal, as they outspeed a +1 Zygarde and can revenge kill it with Draco Meteor, Moonblast, or Foul Play. This set is not especially bulky due to the lack of defensive investment, so do not attempt to use it as a check to setup sweepers like Mega Rayquaza and Swords Dance Primal Groudon, especially prior to transformation. Zygarde can sometimes beat said threats in a one-on-one scenario thanks to Glare and Power Construct, but it cannot do so if they are given a free turn of setup.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Mega Gengar is one of the best partners for Zygarde, as it can trap and remove the Fairy-types and support Arceus formes that stand in the way of a sweep. It takes advantage of the status Zygarde spreads via Glare and Toxic, which boosts the power of its Hex and can potentially buy it free turns to use Substitute. Entry hazard support is crucial for pressuring Zygarde's checks. Primal Groudon, Necrozma-DM, and Arceus-Poison can set Stealth Rock and also check Fairy-types for Zygarde. Ferrothorn and Skarmory can set Spikes and switch into many of Zygarde's checks. Toxapex provides Toxic Spikes support, which enables Zygarde to stall out foes indefinitely with Substitute and Protect. More offensive teams can employ dedicated entry hazard leads such as Deoxys-S and Excadrill. Wallbreakers like Life Orb or Choice Band Mega Rayquaza and Life Orb Yveltal break down checks they share with Zygarde and take advantage of paralysis spread by Glare. Fairy-types can pivot into Dragon-type attacks from Pokemon like Mega Rayquaza, and they tend to lure in Fire-, Steel-, and Poison-types that Zygarde can use as setup fodder. Defensive Arceus-Fairy checks dangerous physical attackers such as Mega Rayquaza and Marshadow and can set Stealth Rock for Zygarde's team. Xerneas and Magearna provide invaluable cleric support, curing this set of status ailments inflicted by Pokemon like Ho-Oh, Primal Groudon, and Arceus-Poison, allowing Zygarde to switch into said foes more liberally. Gothitelle can neutralize passive foes like support Arceus formes and provide Zygarde a safe environment in which to set up; unlike Mega Gengar, it can switch into most of them rather comfortably provided they don't use boosting moves like Calm Mind.</p> "

  "Celesteela": {
    "overview": "<p>Celesteela is a very potent wall in AG, capable of checking common Pokemon such as Swords Dance Ultra Necrozma, Necrozma-DM, Arceus-Fairy, Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Steel, Extreme Killer Arceus, and non-V-create Mega Rayquaza. Its high viability comes from its ability to check almost all Arceus formes and Pokemon that struggle to deal significant damage to it due to its ability to easily recover HP while simultaneously wearing down the opponent's team with Leftovers, Toxic, and Leech Seed. Furthermore, Celesteela possesses a stellar Steel / Flying typing as well as phenomenal natural bulk to go along with it. Immunity to the omnipresent Toxic makes it far easier for it to take on bulky support Pokemon that rely on poisoning the foe, making Celesteela much more challenging to break. Due to how passive it is, however, it's able to be trapped and removed by Shadow Tag Pokemon such as Gothitelle and Will-O-Wisp Mega Gengar, leaving the team open to being annoyed by the offensive and bulky Pokemon that Celesteela handles. Also, Pokemon such as Mega Rayquaza, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Swords Dance Arceus-Ground commonly carry moves to beat Celesteela, with the former carrying V-create and the latter two carrying Substitute in order to set up and take out Celesteela one-on-one. Lastly, due to Celesteela's passive nature and method of removing opposing Pokemon, it cannot properly take advantage of Beast Boost.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Celesteela performs its specific role of walling passive Pokemon and wearing down the opponent's team with Toxic and Leech Seed very well, and due to this specificity, there are very few other options for it. Flamethrower can be used instead of Heavy Slam if Celesteela's team benefits from taking out Ferrothorn and Skarmory, which otherwise wall this set and set up Spikes for free. Shed Shell can be used to mitigate Celesteela's weakness to Gothitelle and Mega Gengar. However, this is discouraged, as Celesteela appreciates Leftovers recovery even just to recover Stealth Rock damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Pokemon such as Primal Groudon and Ho-Oh force Celesteela out due to their type advantage Ho-Oh is not bothered too greatly by any of Celesteela's moves due to Regenerator, and defensive variants of Primal Groudon can sometimes carry Rest.</p> <p><strong>Pokemon Resilient to Leech Seed and Toxic: Pokemon such as Giratina, Zygarde, Ferrothorn, Ho-Oh, and Arceus-Poison are not bothered by Toxic and Leech Seed damage. Ferrothorn is immune to Leech Seed and Toxic but it must be wary of Flame Charge. Ho-Oh is not bothered by Toxic or Leech Seed thanks to Regenerator and forces Celesteela out.</p> <p><strong>Substitute Setup Sweepers: Dragon Dance Zygarde, Swords Dance Arceus, and Swords Dance Arceus-Ground can carry Substitute, making them immune to Celesteela's Toxic and Leech Seed. These Pokemon are also bulky and heavy enough that Celesteela's Heavy Slam does not break their Substitutes.</p> <p><strong>Shadow Tag: Pokemon with Shadow Tag can trap and remove Celesteela, especially Gothitelle, as it does not fear the damage from Heavy Slam as Mega Gengar does.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers</strong>: Pokemon like Yveltal, Primal Kyogre, Geomancy Xerneas with Thunder, Choice Specs Lunala, and Calm Mind Ultra Necrozma can take out Celesteela with their heavy-hitting special attacks due to Celesteela's uninvested Special Defense.</p> <p><strong>Mega Sableye: Mega Sableye can bounce back Celesteela's Leech Seed and Toxic, which effectively shuts it down. It also does not take significant damage from Heavy Slam.</p> ",

        "name": "Physical Wall",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Leech Seed is Celesteela's primary means of maintaining its HP throughout the match. It helps force switches and wears down the opposing team, especially when facing threats like Mega Rayquaza and Marshadow, which do not have access to recovery. Protect is used to increase the recovery Celesteela receives from Leech Seed and Leftovers as well as scout Choice-locked Pokemon. Toxic is used to wear down the opposing team's support Pokemon as well as switch-ins to Celesteela, reducing their overall longevity and pressuring them, making it easier for Celesteela's teammates to sweep. The combination of Substitute and Protect, along with recovery from Leftovers and Leech Seed, enables Celesteela to wear down the foe more efficiently. Flame Charge is used to outspeed threats such as support Arceus, Calm Mind Arceus, and Necrozma-DM. Provided Celesteela hasn't been afflicted with Leech Seed, Flame Charge allows it to beat Ferrothorn. Celesteela is still quite slow after this boost, so Flame Charge must be used multiple times in order to gather significant Speed. Heavy Slam is used to hit Pokemon such as Mega Gengar, which traps Celesteela and can afflict it with Taunt to shut it down otherwise, as well as hitting threats such as Xerneas, Marshadow, Mega Rayquaza, and Ultra Necrozma for solid damage.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Maximum HP and Defense investment helps Celesteela better handle Pokemon such as Marshadow, Swords Dance Arceus formes, and Swords Dance Ultra Necrozma and switch into non-V-create Mega Rayquaza. Its Special Defense is high enough naturally to handle support Arceus and other passive Pokemon uninvested, so it should not be invested in. Leftovers is the only item for Celesteela, as it allows it to recover more HP in conjunction with Leech Seed, as well as providing recovery if Leech Seed misses.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Celesteela should be used primarily to wear down passive Pokemon such as the ubiquitous support Arceus formes, which can do little to Celesteela, while it can poison them with Toxic or recover HP on them. Celesteela should be brought in on Pokemon that it walls such as Arceus-Ground, Arceus-Steel, Arceus-Poison, defensive Necrozma-DM, and Arceus-Fairy. Leech Seed is its most spammable move and should be used generously to keep Celesteela's HP high throughout the match. Protect can be used to scout Choice-locked Pokemon such as Mega Rayquaza, Ho-Oh, and Yveltal. This move must be used carefully, however, as it can give the opponent free setup turns or a boost from Moody. Toxic should be used when Celesteela does not need Leech Seed recovery, as it can permanently hinder an opponent's Pokemon unless a cleric is present. Heavy Slam prevents Celesteela from being completely passive and provides a way to break opposing Pokemon that have Substitute or Taunt. It also more quickly pressures Pokemon that cannot be worn down with status such as Mega Gengar. Flame Charge variants can take on and defeat Pokemon such as Arceus-Steel, Arceus-Poison, and Necrozma-DM, as they can rack up Speed boosts to be faster, set Leech Seed, and use Substitute and Protect to stall out the foe's PP and maintain Celesteela's HP. Celesteela heavily benefits from entry hazard support, as the opponent may try to stall out Leech Seed and Flame Charge's PP with constant switches. Celesteela needs to keep its HP high so it can keep its teammates safe from opposing bulky Toxic users, so it is very important for Celesteela to not stay in against strong special attackers, as it acts as a physical wall to passive Pokemon, as well as not staying in on Pokemon with strong super effective hits such as Zygarde, Mega Rayquaza, Ho-Oh, and Primal Groudon. Celesteela should not be left in against Pokemon with Substitute, as it cannot break it and they are immune to Leech Seed and Toxic. To avoid being trapped by Gothitelle, aggressive switching can be used.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Celesteela acts as a fantastic defensive glue on balanced teams that need to wear down opposing passive walls, so it fits best with Pokemon seen on balanced teams rather than stall. Entry hazard support such as Stealth Rock is great for Celesteela teams, as it increases the damage to the opposing Pokemon when combined with Toxic + Leech Seed damage. Arceus-Rock makes a great partner for Celesteela, as together they can wall most Rayquaza sets with their combined typings, and Arceus-Rock can set Stealth Rock. Arceus-Water can check Pokemon that annoy Celesteela such as Zygarde-C, Ho-Oh, and Primal Groudon, although it must be wary of Toxic. Ferrothorn makes a good partner for Celesteela, as together they form a Leech Seed core that wears down the opposing team, and Ferrothorn can set entry hazards for Celesteela as well as handle Primal Kyogre. Zygarde is another great partner for Celesteela, as it can handle Ho-Oh and Groudon and wall other Zygarde with either Dragon Tail or Haze. It can also help spread Toxic if it opts to run it. Celesteela in turn takes care of support Arceus formes such as Fairy, Water, and Ground. Setup sweepers that benefit from bulky support Pokemon worn down such as Mega Rayquaza and Ultra Necrozma appreciate Celesteela's help. Yveltal and Arceus-Dark are good partners for Celesteela, as they can take out and pressure Mega Gengar and Gothitelle. Offensive answers to Calm Mind Arceus formes such as Arceus-Dark, Arceus-Fairy with Fire Blast, and Arceus-Rock are important if Flame Charge is not used, such as Choice Scarf Rayquaza and Marshadow, as well as defensive ones such as Chansey and Ho-Oh.</p> "

Heart Swap is essential for Magearna because it makes it a reliable answer to Geomancy Xerneas and Calm Mind Arceus variants barring Arceus-Ground and Arceus-Steel. It also allows Magearna to swap over its Special Attack drops from Fleur Cannon onto the opponent. Pain Split can help Magearna stay healthy throughout the game.

Magearna enjoys entry hazards being set up alongside it to take even more advantage of momentum gained by Volt Switch and weaken Ground-types even further. Ferrothorn or Primal Groudon achieve this very well. Powerful breakers such as Primal Kyogre, Marshadow, and Mega Rayquaza make for good partners because they can take advantage of the free switches Magearna can provide for them. Ho-Oh pairs well with Magearna because it can check Necrozma-DM, Calm Mind Arceus-Ground, and Calm Mind Arceus-Steel reliably unless they pack super effective coverage moves. Yveltal and Arceus-Dark appreciate Magearnas ability to reliably answer Fairy-types. Mega Gengar and Gothitelle can take advantage of Magearna's slow Volt Switch and aim to trap Pokemon that switch into it. Lunala also pairs well with Magearna due to its ability to switch into Yveltal and its pivoting ability.</p> "

  "Marshadow": {
    "overview": "<p>Marshadow separates itself from other common picks with reliable and hard-hitting STAB options with unresisted coverage. Its great Speed tier allows it to outpace Mega Rayquaza and Arceus, while its Fighting typing, immunity to Extreme Speed, and ability to steal stat boosts allow it to revenge kill Swords Dance Arceus formes and check some Calm Mind sweepers. A fantastic ability in Technician also enables it to boost the power of moves such as Rock Tomb, Shadow Sneak, Hidden Power Ice, and Pursuit, while a 195-Base Power STAB Z-Move allows it to break through bulky defenders, stall, and balance. Spectral Thief is an amazing STAB move, due to the prevalence of boosting moves in the metagame, that allows Marshadow to be a great weapon against hyper offense. Furthermore, a great priority move in Shadow Sneak helps Marshadow threaten faster Pokemon such as Ultra Necrozma and Mega Gengar, while Bulk Up allows it to be a frighteningly powerful wallbreaker after a boost. Marshadow also has the potential to serve as an excellent revenge killer against offensive teams with correct prediction, but it struggles to break defensive walls it can't hit super effectively. Marshadow also suffers from having poor defensive utility, meaning it can't switch into many of the Pokemon it checks, and is weak to common threats, such as Arceus-Fairy and Yveltal, both of which threaten it out with their respective STAB options. Because of its middling Attack stat, it can be walled by Pokemon such as Arceus-Poison, Primal Groudon, and Zygarde.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Marshadow can also run a Focus Sash set with Endeavor; however, this is completely unreliable due to the prevalence of entry hazards and an incredible lack of power, leaving it unable to break through many common Pokemon. A Choice Scarf set with Pursuit is a niche option to guarantee revenge killing Deoxys-A and often KO Mega Gengar. It can also surprise faster Pokemon and steal their boosts, such as Dragon Dance Mega Rayquaza and Swords Dance Ultra Necrozma. However, this set lacks power and can be easily switched into. A Substitute + Swagger set with Leftovers can be used to force switches; however, this set needs entry hazards to properly function, and it can be hard to initially set up. It also heavily relies on RNG, making it rather unreliable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Support Arceus Formes: Support Arceus formes aren't 2HKOed by any of Marshadow's attacks and use Judgment to put Marshadow under half health or status it with Thunder Wave or Will-O-Wisp, halving one of Marshadow's most important stats. Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Poison are particularly dangerous, as they resist Close Combat and can either KO Marshadow with Judgment or burn it; however, they still have to be wary of getting broken through by Marshadium Z sets.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf Users: The three most common Choice Scarf users, Yveltal, Xerneas, and Mega Rayquaza, all threaten Marshadow out with their STAB moves and can take most hits from it. They aren't bothered by priority moves and can additionally switch into an attack if need be.</p> <p><strong>Zygarde-C: Zygarde-C can beat every Marshadow set lacking Hidden Power Ice due to its immense physical bulk and access to crippling moves such as Dragon Tail and Glare. It still needs to scout for Hidden Power Ice, however, as it reliably KOes it with some prior chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Pokemon such as Ho-Oh, Arceus-Flying, and Yveltal can all take a Spectral Thief quite comfortably, as well as a Close Combat in Yveltal's case. While Marshadow can circumvent this by carrying Rock Tomb, this fails to OHKO all but Ho-Oh, leaving Marshadow open to being KOed by their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Pokemon such as Skarmory, Toxapex, and Mega Sableye can avoid being 2HKOed by Marshadow's STAB options and retaliate with their appropriate STAB moves.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Spectral Thief is Marshadow's preferred STAB move, giving it good coverage, allowing it to steal boosts, and going through Substitute. Shadow Sneak is a good priority option boosted by Technician, effectively receiving 90 Base Power after the boost from STAB and giving Marshadow the ability to revenge kill Mega Rayquaza. Close Combat is Marshadow's hardest-hitting STAB option, and with Life Orb, it allows Marshadow to OHKO many Pokemon that are weak to it. Pursuit allows Marshadow to trap Pokemon such as Mega Gengar, Lunala, and weakened foes, though it needs the opponent to switch for it to be effective. Rock Tomb is boosted to 90 Base Power with Technician, making it hit very hard while also allowing Marshadow to hit Pokemon like Ho-Oh and Choice Scarf Yveltal on the switch. It also provides speed control, which can aid slower sweepers on the team. Hidden Power Ice can be used to KO Zygarde after little chip damage; however, it doesn't have much more utility than that.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Life Orb is used to boost Marshadow's power, allowing it to OHKO Pokemon such as Arceus formes weak to its STAB attacks, which it can't do otherwise. Maximum EVs in Attack and Speed allow Marshadow to hit as hard as possible without sacrificing its crucial Speed tier. A Jolly nature is used if Marshadow lacks Hidden Power Ice; however, Hasty is used if running it as to not lower its Attack. Hasty is run instead of Naive in order to take less damage from neutrally effective Judgment.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Marshadow must be played with caution. Overpredictions can often cost games due to how valuable Marshadow is to most teams. Players should be hesitant to switch Marshadow into Pokemon due to its frailty. Playing cautiously for the start of the game allows you to scout sets to better prepare you to beat the opposing team, which is essential for Marshadow to function. Forcing Necrozma-DM to Ultra Burst or forcing the opponent to reveal Arceus-Steel or Arceus-Dark all benefit Marshadow, since you will know to keep it alive for these threats. Looking for Choice Scarf on Mega Rayquaza and Chople Berry on Arceus is also very important, as not switching Marshadow out can lead to you losing it early. Do not run a coverage move if the Pokemon it beats are already covered by the majority of your team; there is no need to waste a moveslot for additional coverage against a Pokemon that isn't a threat to your team. Additionally, revealing a coverage move at the start of the game can defeat the purpose of it, as said Pokemon will be more cautious around Marshadow. Scouting a team is essential for Marshadow to function. Marshadow struggles to break bulkier Pokemon, so wait to play it until those foes are weakened down enough. Marshadow should also be used as a capable revenge killer, taking out important threats like Dragon Dance Mega Rayquaza and checking Arceus formes such as Arceus-Dark and Arceus-Steel.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Arceus-Fairy is a good option for Marshadow, checking threats to it such as Yveltal, Mega Rayquaza, and opposing Marshadows. Its access to Defog also helps, as Marshadow is greatly hindered by Sticky Web. Zygarde-C assists in checking physical setup sweepers such as Chople Berry Arceus, whether through Coil or through Haze, as well as Arceus-Poison, Primal Groudon, and Mega Rayquaza. Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre are also good options, as both threaten support Arceus formes. Groudon can do this either with Toxic or with a special set, and Kyogre's monstrously high Special Attack allow it to easily 2HKO every viable support Arceus forme. Additionally, Groudon has access to Stealth Rock, which aids Marshadow by providing guaranteed chip damage. Specially defensive Necrozma-DM beats Xerneas and any variant of Arceus-Fairy, Marshadow's biggest bane, while also spreading status, setting Stealth Rock, and having access to reliable recovery to heal off chip damage done by these Fairy-types. Arceus-Steel is also able to check Fairy-types. Mega Gengar can trap support Arceus formes that trouble Marshadow, including Arceus-Fairy and Arceus-Poison. Mega Rayquaza can deal extensive damage to support Arceus formes as they switch in, which can pave the way for Marshadow to break the team, making it an especially notable partner.</p> "

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Bulk Up is an absolute necessity on Z-Move Marshadow sets to OHKO many walls with a little bit of prior damage. Spectral Thief and Close Combat are obligatory STAB moves that hit very hard. Shadow Sneak is a strong priority option though it cannot KO Ultra Necrozma without chip damage or a boost. Substitute is another option that allows Marshadow to dodge Will-O-Wisp, one of its biggest banes while setting up. It also turns Arceus-Poison, one of Marshadow's most reliable checks, into setup fodder.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Marshadium Z with Spectral Thief gives Marshadow access to Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike. This allows it to break through many threats that it could not before, including Mega Rayquaza, Arceus-Fairy, and Primal Kyogre. A Jolly nature is preferred on this set to maximize Marshadow's Speed for Arceus formes without lowering any important stats.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Marshadow greatly appreciates entry hazards, as it relies on weakening down checks to properly operate. Avoid boosting until said checks are worn down into its KO range. This allows you to properly break the team, instead of the opponent already knowing what set Marshadow is running. Play cautiously with Marshadow's Z-Move, as it is its biggest weapon. The opponent will often try to sacrifice weakened Pokemon to get in their check to Marshadow. Marshadium Z Marshadow can be a threat versus stall if it's played carefully and sets up at the right time.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Marshadow appreciates Spikes and Stealth Rock support, as it can get the chip damage it needs on threats. Mega Rayquaza is a good partner for Marshadow, breaking Choice Scarf Yveltal, Primal Groudon, Primal Kyogre, and Zygarde-C, depending on the set. Eliminating these Pokemon assists in a sweep. Arceus-Steel is a good offensive option, as it switches into both Yveltal and Arceus-Fairy and threatens many teams due to the lack of reliable checks to it. Gothitelle is a good partner, as it traps support Arceus formes and renders them incapable of stopping Marshadow, as well as allowing you to switch Marshadow in directly when the trapped Pokemon has been PP stalled for free setup.</p> "
