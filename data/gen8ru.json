Charizard remains a solid pick for sun teams despite facing competition from Solar Power Heliolisk, which has a higher Speed tier and better defensive typing that grants a Ghost immunity and Flying resistance, as a wallbreaker. Solar Beam makes it so bulky Water-types such as Gastrodon and Milotic, as well as bulky Rock-types such as Diancie, cannot wall Charizard safely in sun. Scorching Sands hits Fire-types such as Volcanion, Chandelure, and Incineroar, as well as Dragalge, which could give its team grievances. Fire Blast provides a strong Fire-type STAB attack outside of sun, while Roost lets Charizard heal against Grass-types such as Vileplume and Roserade and Pokemon attempting to stall out sun turns with Protect, such as Umbreon, Suicune, and Chandelure. Heavy-Duty Boots improves Charizard's longevity, although Choice Specs is an option to increase its wallbreaking capabilities and secure KOs, such as OHKOing defensive Togekiss, at the cost of being less consistent due to the crippling Stealth Rock weakness and being Choice-locked.</p> <p>Charizard is only seen on sun teams, so its partners should reflect this. Torkoal sets sun and empowers Charizard, Chlorophyll sweepers such as Shitry can capitalize on Charizard's wallbreaking and ability to handle Togekiss and opposing Fire-types, and wallbreakers such as Darmanitan and Entei provide additional offensive pressure as well as pivot support and strong priority. Xatu makes a solid partner for Charizard thanks to its ability to block entry hazards with Magic Bounce with Teleport, for Charizard to take advantage of should especially if it opts to run Choice Specs. Klefki makes an excellent manual sun setter and provides Spikes to wear down bulky Water-types. Other partners include Choice Scarf Flygon, which can safely bring in Charizard with U-turn and provide a valuable Rock resistance, and Choice Scarf Gardevoir, which provides Healing Wish and can cripple Pokemon like Snorlax with Trick or bring Charizard in safely with Teleport.</p> "

  "Nidoqueen": {
    "overview": "<p>Nidoqueen is both a premier offensive Stealth Rock setter and a devastating Sheer Force wallbreaker with few safe switch-ins. It can forgo Stealth Rock altogether to run a dedicated wallbreaker set, which can even get past some usual answers like Umbreon, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Bronzong with the right moves. Nidoqueen's typing lends it crucial resistances like Fighting and an immunity to Electric, which lets it check prominent Pokemon such as Cobalion and Raikou. Most importantly, however, is having that Electric immunity without a Grass weakness, which lets it check Xurkitree and block its Volt Switch, a trait only shared by Steelix. However, Nidoqueen's lack of reliable recovery severely cuts into how long it can check a foe. At best, it might check a Pokemon like Xurkitree twice, but Nidoqueen can take full advantage of these opportunities to punish the opponent with an onslaught of Sheer Force + Life Orb boosted attacks. Nidoqueen's slightly below average Speed is just enough to get the jump on common Pokemon such as Volcanion and Metagross, but it barely misses out on a lot of other prevalent threats like Togekiss, Gardevoir, and Xurkitree. This often leads to worse matchups against fast-paced teams, as Nidoqueen will have fewer opportunities to set Stealth Rock or get an attack off against faster foes.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A specially defensive set with Black Sludge is viable on balance and stall teams as a solid switch-in to Xurkitree, but it competes with Steelix and is harder to fit elsewhere, as more offensive teams heavily value Nidoqueen's wallbreaking ability. With Choice Scarf, Nidoqueen can outspeed and surprise KO revenge killers such as Flygon, Obstagoon, and Celebi, but outside of the surprise factor, it's generally outclassed by other Choice Scarf users due to its lower Speed tier. Nidoqueen can set Toxic Spikes, but the abundance of Poison-types such as opposing Nidoqueen and Roserade, Heavy-Duty Boots users, and ungrounded Pokemon, such as Crobat and Flygon, leaves few relevant targets for the move. Focus Blast with a Modest nature 2HKOes Umbreon and Porygon2 after Stealth Rock, but Nidoqueen already has more reliable methods to deal with both in Taunt and Toxic.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Specially defensive Pokemon such as Assault Vest Reuniclus, Umbreon, and the rarer Porygon2 can comfortably switch into any of Nidoqueen's attacks; Reuniclus, in particular, does this well, as it out-heals any damage it takes with Regenerator. However, all of them need to watch out for Toxic, and Umbreon also fears Taunt. Snorlax can switch in with ease and use Nidoqueen as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Certain bulky Water-types such as Milotic, Jellicent, and Vaporeon sport high enough special bulk to comfortably switch into Nidoqueen. However, the former two will lose in the long run to sets with Toxic, and all of them fear the rare Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats: Common faster threats such as Flygon, Starmie, and Gardevoir can outspeed and KO Nidoqueen but can't safely switch in. Gardevoir can even copy Sheer Force with Trace to boost its moves and make it harder for Nidoqueen's teammates to deal with it.</p> <p><strong>Bronzong: Thanks to Levitate, Bronzong hard counters any Nidoqueen set without Fire Blast.</p> ",

Ice Beam OHKOes Flygon and 2HKOes Crobat, both of which Nidoqueen can't touch without it. Sheer Force, alongside Life Orb, lets Nidoqueen OHKO or 2HKO most of the tier except the bulkiest of special walls. Still, Shuca Berry is a valid option to check Flygon and other Ground-types Nidoqueen lures in. 16 Defense EVs can be run with Shuca Berry so Nidoqueen isn't OHKOed by Outrage from Choice Band Flygon. A Timid nature ensures Nidoqueen outspeeds Pokemon such as Volcanion and 24 Special Defense EVs avoid the 2HKO from Xurkitree's Energy Ball.</p> <p>Cobalion, Obstagoon, Togekiss, and Pangoro can all take advantage of Nidoqueen's switch-ins such as Assault Vest Reuniclus and Umbreon. Pivots such as Crobat and Noivern can provide free switches with U-turn against Steel- and Rock-types such as Registeel, Metagross, and Diancie. Crobat and Noivern also help check Fighting-types, which Nidoqueen can't reliably do on its own, as can Reuniclus and Galarian Weezing. Dark-types such as Umbreon, Incineroar, and Guzzlord can check Psychic-types such as Assault Vest Reuniclus and Celebi, while Steel-types such as Metagross and Escavalier can take on Calm Mind Reuniclus and Gardevoir. Umbreon deserves special mention, as it also keeps Nidoqueen healthy throughout the match with Wish. Electric- and Grass-types such as Xurkitree, Celebi, and Rotom-C take care of bulky Water-types, and Grass-types are also crucial for Electric-types like Xurkitree, Raikou, and Rotom-C, which can otherwise overwhelm Nidoqueen with either repeated strong attacks or super effective coverage. Water-types such as Milotic, Golisopod, and Vaporeon help with common Ground-types like Flygon. Golisopod also provides Spikes to help Nidoqueen out-damage Assault Vest Reuniclus's Regenerator healing and wear down other switch-ins like Umbreon, while, similarly to Umbreon, Vaporeon can heal it with Wish.</p> "

Thunderbolt is an option to 2HKO bulky Water-types such as Milotic, Jellicent, and Vaporeon after Stealth Rock.

Pivots such as Crobat, Noivern, and Tornadus can provide free switches with U-turn against Steel- and Rock-types such as Registeel, Metagross, and Diancie. The former two also help Nidoqueen check Fighting-types, which it can't do on its own, while the latter can help break through Umbreon with Superpower. Steel-types such as Registeel, Metagross, Stakataka, and Bronzong halt any Psychic-types like Gardevoir and Celebi trying to take advantage of Nidoqueen. Water-types such as Milotic, Golisopod, and Vaporeon can soak up hits from Ground-types such as Flygon. Golisopod also provides Spikes, which lets Nidoqueen push past Assault Vest Reuniclus without needing Toxic and more quickly whittle down Umbreon if Nidoqueen is running Toxic. Meanwhile, Vaporeon is noteworthy for its Wish support, which keeps Nidoqueen healthy throughout the match. Grass-types such as Celebi, Dhelmise, and Roserade can deal with Water-types like Milotic and Vaporeon, and they help Nidoqueen check Electric-types such as Xurkitree, Raikou, and Rotom-C, which can otherwise overwhelm it with either repeated strong hits or super effective coverage.</p> "

Unfortunately, Vileplume can get worn down quickly and is often forced to use its recovery to remain healthy, which gives openings to Pokemon it invites in like Toxtricity and common Flying-types such as Noivern and Crobat. Strength Sap is Vileplume’s main recovery move and allows it to lower the Attack stat of an opposing physical attacker. Corrosive Gas is used to remove important items such as Leftovers, Heavy-Duty Boots, and Choice items from Pokemon such as Cobalion, Crobat, and Toxtricity. Alternatively, Sleep Powder can be used to put common switch-ins such as Crobat and Noivern to sleep, generating free turns for itself and its teammates. An alternative EV spread of 252 HP / 144 Def / 112 SpD can be used to avoid a 4HKO from Xurkitree's Thunderbolt. Vileplume is best suited for balance teams that need a check for prominent physical attackers such as Zarude and Mienshao. Due to Vileplume's weakness to Fire-types, bulky Water-types such as Suicune and Milotic can be great teammates. In return, Vileplume can handle offensive Electric-types such as Xurkitree and Raikou. Since Vileplume often invites in Flying-types like Crobat and Tornadus, checks to these Pokemon such as Xurkitree and Raikou are good partners. Registeel and Steelix also make great teammates for Vileplume, since they are able to check offensive Psychic-types such as Gardevoir and Necrozma.

        "description": "<p>Shell Smash Cloyster's ability to potentially break past its checks through flinches make it a threatening setup sweeper. It also takes advantage of teams relying on Seismitoad and Gastrodon as their bulky Water-type, as neither is a suitable Cloyster check. Rock Blast hits Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune neutrally, helping Cloyster beat them with flinches. It also hits Volcanion and can be used against other Fire-types like Incineroar and Chandelure. Hydro Pump is the preferred last move due to its greater damage against Steel-types such as Metagross, Cobalion, and Steelix. Liquidation can be used instead to OHKO Diancie and potentially 2HKO Registeel after Spikes damage while also giving Cloyster a more reliable Water-type STAB move. However, it makes Cloyster more reliant on breaking past the aforementioned Steel-types with flinches. King's Rock gives Cloyster's Icicle Spear and Rock Blast an effective 41% flinch chance. A Naive or Jolly nature should be used, as they allow +2 Cloyster to outrun Choice Scarf Mienshao. Explosion can be used to take down Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune for a teammate. Focus Sash can be used to almost guarantee setup, but this requires solid entry hazard removal, and Cloyster loses out on the ability to break past its checks with flinches. Life Orb is another item option that allows Cloyster to KO notable threats such as Cobalion, Galarian Weezing, Metagross, and Doublade at +2 without prior residual damage. Spikes allows Cloyster, which beats most Defoggers, to give value to its team in a matchup where it doesn't do much else. However, Spikes also forces Cloyster to ditch its Water-type STAB moves, which worsens its matchup against Steel-types significantly.</p> <p>Cloyster's natural physical bulk is impressive even without investment and gives it some notable setup opportunities against Pokemon such as Darmanitan, Crobat lacking Taunt, and Mimikyu. Cloyster is potentially capable of breaking past its defensive answers with flinches, but this requires a fair bit of luck. Bulky Water- and Steel-types can halt Cloyster barring an ill-timed flinch, so efforts should be put into wearing these Pokemon down. Most of the tier's bulky Steel-types will get worn down by Spikes; offensive Metagross, Cobalion, and Doublade will be in KO range of +2 Hydro Pump after switching in with three layers of Spikes, while Liquidation variants will be able to reliably 2HKO Registeel after two layers. Therefore, Spikes setters like Klefki and Roserade are good teammates. Cloyster's ability to take advantage of Spikes and cause its targets to flinch makes it a great choice for hyper offense teams, as it can be a devastating wincon or a supportive wallbreaker for another sweeping teammate such as Necrozma, Mimikyu, or Polteageist. Cloyster is also capable of sweeping on standard offensive and bulky offensive teams. Teams utilizing Cloyster in this regard should attempt to wear down bulky Water- and Steel-types. Knock Off from the likes of Incineroar, Reuniclus, and Obstagoon can remove Leftovers from Pokemon like Registeel and Suicune, making it easier for Cloyster to break through them. Pivoting teammates, such as Mienshao, Incineroar, and Crobat, can get Cloyster into battle safely. Toxic from Diancie and Salazzle can help wear down Water-types to let Cloyster go wild late-game.</p> "

Heracross is also capable of sweeping and cleaning with a Choice Scarf set and Moxie. However, Heracross has nearly no defensive utility and lacks any longevity, so it sometimes struggles to come in safely and make use of its strength.

Megahorn lets Heracross cleave through Grass- and Psychic-types such as Vileplume, Necrozma, and Reuniclus, which can normally take on most other Fighting-types. Facade is great at thrashing the Flying-types of the tier in Togekiss, Crobat, and Noivern on the switch, as well as being a safe option if you don't want to deal with Close Combat dropping defenses or Megahorn's accuracy. Knock Off hits Ghost-types such as Chandelure, Golurk, and Mimikyu while being great at crippling Pokemon such as Togekiss, Crobat, and Galarian Weezing.

Heracross pairs very well with Volt Switch users such as Raikou and Xurkitree, which invite in the Grass-types that it preys on while covering its Flying weakness.

Pokemon such as Starmie, Flygon, and the aforementioned Crobat help Heracross stick around by clearing entry hazards and provide the momentum it adores. Starmie in particular is a great partner thanks to Rapid Spin keeping your hazards up, helping Heracross grab more KOs throughout the game, which Dhelmise can also provide. Setters such as Stakataka and Diancie can provide these hazards Heracross loves while checking Pokemon that give it trouble such as Togekiss and Crobat.

Its biggest problem is its glaring inability to hit Gastrodon and Flygon very hard; the best it can do is use Toxic or try to burn Flygon with Scald, so they hold it off well early-game. Its attacks are generally a bit weak, so it often relies on teammates to actually break through bulky Pokemon like Registeel and Assault Vest Reuniclus, and its defensive typing isn't good for much beyond switching into Togekiss and Xurkitree; this means it's hesitant to take strong attacks. The Calm Mind set sacrifices Volt Switch, making it a worse team player and harder to fit, and Xurkitree and Toxtricity are much better than pivot Raikou at breaking through cores by themselves.</p> ",

Substitute provides Suicune with a way to protect itself from status effects, which will cripple sets lacking Rest, and is especially effective for PP stalling Pokemon unable to break its substitute in one hit. Note that Suicune must still be cautious not to switch into status moves like Toxic and Thunder Wave from the likes of Registeel, Togekiss, and Klefki. Protect enables Suicune to scout Choice item users, stall out low PP moves, and gain additional Leftovers recovery. Ice Beam can be used to hit the likes of Zarude and Seismitoad after boosting, which are otherwise major threats. Roar is another option that allows Suicune to phaze out other setup sweepers and rack up entry hazard damage.

This set has difficulty setting up Calm Mind against offensive Electric-types like Xurkitree, Raikou, Heliolisk, and Toxtricity, so checks like Roserade, Zarude, Celebi, and Porgyon2 work well with it. Heliolisk has the added danger of Dry Skin causing Water-type moves to heal it, so Suicune must be played particularly carefully against it. If running Roar, Suicune can phaze foes into Spikes provided by Roserade, making it a particularly notable partner.</p> "

It also has perfect coverage to hit the tier for at least neutral damage, making it sometimes difficult to deal with it. However, Ludicolo is very dependent on rain to make up for its mediocre offensive presence; otherwise, it is very easy to check and revenge kill. Even under rain, Ludicolo still struggles against specially defensive Pokemon that are not weak to its STAB moves, such as Assault Vest Reuniclus, Umbreon, and Porygon2. Many Pokemon can also revenge kill Ludicolo such as First Impression Golisopod, Trace Gardevoir, and Choice Scarf Flygon, even under rain. Ludicolo is also difficult to fit on many rain teams, as they prefer other Swift Swim sweepers like Kingdra and Kabutops or teammates such as Tornadus and Noivern that can handle problematic foes like Toxicroak and bulky Grass-types.</p> ",

Registeel and Bronzong can be 2HKOed by Weather Ball under rain after some chip damage, but they can stall out some rain turns with Protect and cripple Ludicolo with Toxic. Once rain is over, these Pokemon deal with Ludicolo more easily.</p> <p><strong>Faster Threats and Priority Users: Trace Gardevoir and Choice Scarf Flygon outspeed and revenge kill Ludicolo, even in rain. Golisopod OHKOes Ludicolo immediately with First Impression, while other priority users such as Lucario and Entei revenge kill Ludicolo once it is weakened enough. Klefki can be OHKOed by Ludicolo's Weather Ball under rain after some chip damage; however, it can keep Ludicolo in check with Prankster Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Toxicroak: Toxicroak is a huge threat to rain teams due to its typing, Dry Skin, and Sucker Punch. It is also a threat to Ludicolo, since it takes both of Ludicolo's STAB moves easily and can either OHKO it with Gunk Shot or revenge kill with Sucker Punch. However, Toxicroak is quite frail and can be 2HKOed by Ice Beam.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather</strong>: Opposing weather setters can be extremely annoying for Ludicolo, since it is dependent on rain.

A bulky Dragon Dance set with Roost can take advantage of Flygon's great defensive typing to accumulate multiple boosts, but it struggles to break through bulky Water-types even more than fully offensive sets already do. Scale Shot is an alternative STAB option over Outrage that boosts Flygon's Speed, which is especially useful on Choice Band sets to both wallbreak and clean up late-game, but its inconsistent power makes it a less desirable choice.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Water-types such as Milotic, Gastrodon, and Suicune are bulky enough to take even boosted attacks from Flygon and can KO back with Ice Beam, but they are 2HKOed by Choice Band Outrage on the switch and don't enjoy Toxic.

Rarer bulky Fairy-types such as Sylveon and Levitate Galarian Weezing can take on any set with relative ease. Gardevoir can copy Levitate with Trace, making it immune to both of Flygon's STAB moves, and has a good chance to survive even a +1 Life Orb-boosted Stone Edge.

Life Orb is the preferred item to guarantee the OHKO on maximum HP Togekiss with +1 Stone Edge, but a Lum Berry can be used instead to set up on Pokemon like Raikou without being crippled by Toxic or a Scald burn.

Grass-types like Roserade and Celebi can switch into Water-types while also making up for Flygon struggling to check Electric-types such as Raikou and Xurkitree. Roserade also provides Spikes support to whittle down Flygon's checks and counters. Celebi, on the other hand, appreciates Flygon removing Togekiss and can provide free switches with U-turn. Strong priority users like Golisopod and Lucario need to be dealt with before Flygon can attempt a sweep. Togekiss can check Golisopod while softening up the opposing team for Flygon with its Nasty Plot set or provide valuable support with Heal Bell and Wish.

    "overview": "<p>Milotic is a solid all-purpose bulky Water-type in the RU tier. This is thanks to a great combination of mixed defenses, good movepool, decent Speed as a defensive Pokemon, and an ability that actually gives it a benefit from being hit by status moves. Flip Turn even allows Milotic to be used on faster-paced teams, as it becomes a bulky Pokemon that can actually build or maintain momentum. Milotic's ability to check powerful threats like Darmanitan, Flygon, Noivern, and Metagross is very welcome on many teams. However, Milotic finds itself in a tier where Electric- and Grass-types, such as Raikou, Toxtricity, Celebi, and Roserade, are incredibly potent. While Milotic's ability to take hits of all kinds is relatively uncommon for defensive Pokemon, it does mean that extremely powerful wallbreakers, such as Lucario and Heracross, can use their powerful STAB moves to brute force their way past Milotic.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Competitive set can be a Defog deterrent on Spikes stacking teams, as the common Defoggers do not generally fare well against a Milotic with boosted Ice Beam. Marvel Scale might make Flame Orb strategies look appealing, but the constant chip damage forces Milotic to use Recover way too often.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types</strong>: RU is not short on Electric-types, and all of them can simply push past Milotic's defenses with powerful STAB moves. Raikou and Xurkitree aren't scared of Scald nor hindered too badly by a potential Toxic, as they rarely stay in long. Toxtricity is more vulnerable to Flip Turns as it switches in due to its much lower Speed, but similarly threatens out Milotic if it safely switches in and is immune to Toxic. Heliolisk, though much less common than the others, is perhaps the worst enemy of Milotic thanks to Dry Skin even cutting off Milotic's ability to pivot out with Flip Turn as Heliolisk switches in.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Celebi, Roserade, and Decidueye easily handle Milotic. Celebi's Natural Cure can make Toxic and Scald burns a non-factor for it, while Roserade's Natural Cure and secondary Poison typing work similarly. Both can utilize their powerful Grass-type STAB moves to eliminate Milotic. To make matters worse, Celebi can maintain momentum with U-turn on a forced switch out, while Roserade can litter the field with Spikes to undermine Milotic's bulk later on.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers: Milotic's good but not spectacular mixed bulk means that very powerful wallbreakers can push past it. Choice Specs Indeedee, Guts Heracross, Obstagoon, and Nasty Plot Togekiss are all strong enough to overcome Milotic with powerful neutral STAB moves.</p> ",

Flip Turn generally is preferred to generate and maintain momentum as a defensive Pokemon, something that is generally uncommon. This is especially helpful on faster-paced teams that would rather have Milotic stay a step ahead of threats like Raikou and Roserade. Ice Beam prevents Grass-types from switching into Milotic as freely, discouraging Roserade from using Spikes freely. It also OHKOs Noivern and Flygon. Toxic is able to cripple defensive Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Gastrodon, which can help Milotic's more offensive teammates push past them. It also is great for chipping away at common switch-ins like Raikou and Xurkitree. Haze is a great alternative that allows Milotic to stall out Substitute + Protect variants of Suicune lacking Toxic as well as prevent Calm Mind Reuniclus from taking advantage of Milotic's low damage output. On more defensive teams, Haze is a solid option over Flip Turn or Ice Beam, as these teams generally don't care as much about momentum as they do about covering as many offensive threats as possible. Milotic's 48 Speed EVs enable it to outpace Adamant Golurk.</p> <p>As Milotic is a defensive Pokemon that can maintain momentum, it can work on faster-paced teams that appreciate having it as a defensive backbone when they're forced out by certain Pokemon. Toxtricity and Raikou are powerful Electric-types that can threaten the majority of the tier and appreciate Milotic being able to bring them in safely. VoltTurn cores with the likes of Cobalion, Incineroar, Xurkitree, and Raikou are also powerful on more offensive teams that aim to maintain momentum. Roserade is a great check to most Electric-types, can spare Milotic from Toxic from the likes of Porygon2 and bulky Water-types, and litter the field with Spikes to amplify the effects of Flip Turn. In return, Milotic is able to check offensive Steel-types and multiple Fire-types. Porygon2 is another great slow pivot move user on balance teams that can also run Toxic to allow Milotic to more easily use Haze for the likes of Snorlax and Suicune. Registeel, Togekiss, and Galarian Weezing are great options on slower teams. Registeel is able to set up Stealth Rock, check Indeedee and most Electric- and Grass-types, and appreciates Milotic being able to switch into most Fire- and Ground-types looking to take on Registeel. Galarian Weezing and Togekiss are able to take on the likes of Obstagoon, Pangoro, and Heracross for Milotic. Galarian Weezing can even set Toxic Spikes so Milotic doesn't have to waste a turn using Toxic, while Togekiss can use Defog to clear the field of entry hazards, which sometimes force Milotic to use Recover more often than it would like.</p> "

  "Roserade": {
    "overview": "<p>Roserade has found its place in RU as a Spiker that is able to stand up to the top Electric-types Raikou and Xurkitree. Once it switches in, its good STAB combination can be difficult for teams without a particularly bulky Steel- or Poison-type to handle. Its Spikes support is greatly appreciated by wallbreakers and setup sweepers, as it helps to wear down their conventional checks. Additionally, Natural Cure Roserade is one of the best switch-ins to bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune, being able to negate Scald burns. However, Roserade's low Defense and average Speed are easily exploited by physical attackers such as Metagross, Darmanitan, and Choice Scarf Heracross. While Roserade's main opportunities to switch in are against Pokemon such as Raikou, Xurkitree, and Milotic, these Pokemon can easily pivot out with Volt Switch or Flip Turn. Roserade is also pressured by common Flying-types such as Crobat and Noivern, which KO it with their STAB moves immediately or after a bit of prior damage.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Life Orb can be used with Leaf Storm to provide greater damage output and a chance to OHKO threats such as Volcanion and Necrozma while also doing more damage against Steel-types such as Cobalion, Metagross and Steelix. However, this comes at the cost of being more vulnerable to Electric-types due to Life Orb recoil. Grass Knot is an alternative Grass-type STAB move that provides consistent damage against Pokemon such as Stakataka, Suicune, and Raikou. However, it does not provide recovery like Giga Drain and does not have as much damage potential as Leaf Storm. Shadow Ball hits some of Roserade's conventional checks in Chandelure, Doublade, and Metagross, while Extrasensory hits Poison-types such as Crobat, Dragalge, Salazzle, and Toxtricity. However, they require Roserade to give up an important utility move.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Assault Vest Reuniclus: Assault Vest Reuniclus is able to switch into Roserade's attacks with impunity. However, it is susceptible to being worn down by Roserade's Spikes and poison from Sludge Bomb, and it has to watch out for Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types</strong>: Steel-types such as Metagross and Registeel can switch into Roserade's attacks fairly freely and are immune to Sludge Bomb. However, they are prone to getting worn down by Spikes, have to watch out for Sleep Powder, and have no form of reliable recovery to offset any damage taken.</p> <p><strong>Fast Flying-types: Fast Flying-types such as Crobat and Noivern can be huge nuisances to Roserade, as they outspeed it and can threaten it with STAB moves. However, Noivern is unable to switch in directly, as Sludge Bomb does a lot of damage and can poison it.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types such as Chandelure and Darmanitan threaten Roserade massively with their Fire-type STAB moves, while it is unable to OHKO them. However, they cannot act as direct switch-ins, as Sludge Bomb does decent damage and can limit their effectiveness in the long run with poison.</p> ",

On the other hand, Leaf Storm pressures checks such as Metagross and Stakataka with Spikes up while also OHKOing offensive threats such as Xurkitree. Synthesis allows Roserade to more reliably check Raikou and Xurkitree. On the other hand, Sleep Powder is able to net free turns for teammate wallbreakers or setup sweepers. Heavy-Duty Boots keeps entry hazards from pressuring Roserade into repeatedly using Synthesis. However, on teams with sufficient entry hazard control, Black Sludge can be considered to provide Roserade with extra recovery, which can help it take attacks more comfortably.</p> <p>Roserade is unable to hit most Steel-types, including Metagross and Registeel, for any meaningful damage. Therefore, Fighting-type wallbreakers such as Pangoro and Heracross make for good partners. They also greatly appreciate Roserade's Spikes support and ability to handle bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Suicune. Late-game sweepers such as Sharpedo and Tyrantrum also appreciate Roserade's Spikes support weakening their checks. In order to increase the effectiveness of Spikes, Knock Off users such as Incineroar and Heracross are necessary to remove Heavy-Duty Boots. Rock- and Steel-types such as Diancie, Stakataka, and Registeel check Flying-types, which threaten to easily KO Roserade and remove Spikes with Defog. Fire-types such as Darmanitan and Entei are a huge nuisance to Roserade, so bulky Water-types such as Milotic and Gastrodon complement it nicely. Gastrodon's ability to check Electric-types and block Volt Switch alleviates pressure from Roserade and prevents it from getting too worn down throughout the course of the game, especially if it chooses to run Sleep Powder over Synthesis.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Gastrodon has won its title as one of RU's best blanket checks by solidly handling Raikou, Steel-types, certain Water-types, and certain Fire-types like Darmanitan and Salazzle as well as by checking various weaker attackers like Noivern in a pinch. Recover gives it great longevity, and Clear Smog can be used to hold off bulky setup sweepers like Reuniclus, which has pretty few surefire answers. Its solid coverage in Earth Power alongside Ice Beam or Scald keeps it from a being particularly easy wall for offensive teams to switch into. However, many of the Pokemon it can switch into run Toxic or Knock Off, so it will often be under pressure from passive damage, especially when used as a blanket check on more offensive teams. These conditions will force Gastrodon to use Recover at predictable times, which will give up offensive momentum. It's forced out by the powerful and common Grass-types Celebi and Roserade, which can make progress as Gastrodon switches out by using U-turn or Spikes.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Using Sticky Hold as Gastrodon's ability is feasible if you don't expect to face Water-types, or if your team's counterplay to them is very solid overall; it makes Gastrodon a solid Knock Off absorber against weaker users like Incineroar and Salazzle. Protect is difficult to fit but eliminates guessing games against Choice-locked Xurkitree and Toxtricity trying to force Gastrodon out. Curse lets Gastrodon beat Psyshock + Calm Mind Reuniclus and present a late-game threat, but it's vulnerable to faster special attackers, status ailments, and critical hits.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon and Coverage: Grass is naturally the best way to immediately threaten a Water / Ground type like Gastrodon. Roserade, Vileplume, Celebi, Dhelmise, and Decidueye are RU's main Grass-types and make various forms of progress as Gastrodon is forced out, though none like switching into Ice Beam and some fear Scald burns. Grass-type coverage on other Pokemon, including Energy Ball Xurkitree and Chandelure, easily takes Gastrodon out.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage and Offensive Pressure: Gastrodon's solid typing and bulk make it difficult for most Pokemon to quickly and safely defeat, but many of the Pokemon it checks can hit it with Toxic on the switch, particularly Raikou. Toxic poison limits how long Gastrodon can stay in, forces it to spend more turns using Recover, and makes it easier for Pokemon to 2HKO with neutral attacks. Using Leftovers or losing Heavy-Duty Boots to Knock Off causes entry hazard damage to similarly accumulate.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Pokemon with Recovery: Toxic Gastrodon is setup fodder for Calm Mind Reuniclus and most Suicune, while Clear Smog Gastrodon cannot pressure other walls like Milotic and Togekiss.

  "Bronzong": {
    "overview": "<p>Bronzong's unique access to Levitate sets it apart from its Steel-type competition and lets it check many top-tier Pokemon such as Metagross, Nidoqueen, and Flygon. Furthermore, Levitate prevents Spikes from wearing Bronzong down, and it resists Stealth Rock, which lets it fit and perform without issue on teams lacking solid entry hazard control. Bronzong's main appeal is the role compression it provides, but simultaneously serving as a bulky Steel-type, checking Ground-types, and maintaining Stealth Rock can quickly overwhelm it. Bronzong can struggle to keep Stealth Rock up against common Defoggers and spinners like Volcanion, Dhelmise, and Starmie; however, it works wonders against others like Flygon and Crobat. Bronzong's typing has many upsides, but it comes with nasty weaknesses to the common Dark- and Ghost-types and the ever-so-prevalent Knock Off. On top of that, Bronzong's low Attack stat means that it's complete setup fodder for Calm Mind Reuniclus and it gives wallbreakers such as Obstagoon, Golurk, and Volcanion free switches in. If Bronzong's Ground immunity isn't needed, then it's generally outdone by other bulky Steel-types such as Registeel, Metagross, and Steelix, which have far greater Special Defense, more offensive presence, and better defensive typing, respectively.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A fully physically defensive EV spread could be used to handle Pokemon like Metagross and Flygon even better but makes the matchup against Gardevoir, Necrozma, and Noivern significantly worse. Protect is an option to scout Choice-locked foes like Golurk and gain extra Leftovers recovery, but it's hard to fit over Toxic and Earthquake. Hypnosis can be used over Toxic on more offensive teams to provide either safe switch-ins or setup opportunities to its offensive teammates. It also prevents Bronzong from being completely helpless against Calm Mind Reuniclus, but it's generally too inconsistent to be worth it. Iron Defense + Body Press gives Bronzong a more offensive presence and can potentially sweep ill-prepared teams, but such sets are hard-pressed to choose between Toxic to cripple Ghost-types and a Steel-type move for Nasty Plot Togekiss. Bronzong has another stellar ability in Heatproof, but the most common Fire-types—Volcanion, Incineroar, and Chandelure—all carry moves that get by Heatproof, and Pokemon such as Choice Specs Gardevoir and Necrozma can run coverage moves like Shadow Ball and Earth Power. Psychic is an option to hit Poison- and Fighting-types like Crobat, Vileplume, and Toxicroak, but Bronzong most often prefers its listed attacks. Trick alongside Choice Band could cripple bulky switch-ins such as Calm Mind Reuniclus, but Bronzong sorely misses Leftovers recovery.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Calm Mind Reuniclus: Bronzong is complete setup fodder for Calm Mind Reuniclus, as its attacks will barely leave a scratch and Toxic doesn't deal damage due to Magic Guard.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types</strong>: Dark-types such as Incineroar, Obstagoon, Pangoro, and Sharpedo all pose a huge threat to Bronzong. The former three can even switch in on Bronzong to varying degrees. Incineroar's Intimidate reduces even Earthquake to pitiful damage, Obstagoon can switch in once on even Heavy Slam or Gyro Ball, and Pangoro takes next to nothing from Heavy Slam. Obstagoon also can't be badly poisoned by Toxic once its Flame Orb burns it. Umbreon completely walls Bronzong, can heal itself of Toxic with Heal Bell, and can pass a Wish to a more offensive teammate.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: Ghost-types such as Chandelure, Golurk, and Decidueye all threaten Bronzong with their strong STAB moves. Golurk also takes nothing from Heavy Slam, so it can often hard switch into Bronzong. Chandelure needs to watch out for Earthquake, but besides that, it can switch into Bronzong. Dhelmise can switch in and further remove Bronzong's Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin. Polteageist and Doublade can set up against Bronzong without much trouble. Mimikyu can set up on Bronzong due to Disguise. However, none of them, besides Doublade, enjoy getting badly poisoned by Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off And Corrosive Gas: Bronzong's only form of recovery is Leftovers, so losing it is detrimental to its longevity. Golisopod, Tornadus, and Assault Vest Reuniclus can all threaten to remove its Leftovers with Knock Off. Corrosive Gas Vileplume is especially troublesome because a good amount of teams with Bronzong lack good additional switch-ins to it, thus forcing Bronzong to accept losing its item.</p> <p><strong>Starmie: Starmie poses a real nuisance to Bronzong, as it can switch into any of Bronzong's moves without much care and remove Stealth Rock with Rapid Spin. Moreover, Starmie doesn't mind Toxic thanks to Natural Cure, heals off any damage it takes with Recover, and can threaten Bronzong with a potential Scald burn or safely switch a wallbreaker onto the field with Teleport.</p> ",

Golurk appreciates reliable pivots such as Xurkitree, Porygon2, and Incineroar, since it struggles to find switch-in opportunities. Noivern and Crobat often lure bulky Steel- and Rock-types like Registeel, Bronzong, and Diancie for Golurk takes advantage of. They are also good checks to Grass-types like Roserade and Celebi. Normal- and bulky Dark-types such as Porygon2, Snorlax, Umbreon, and Incineroar prevents Poltergeist from being used freely. Fighting-types such as Cobalion, Heracross, and Bewear are practical teammates to check these Pokemon offensively; Toxic Spikes and Spikes setters like Roserade, Klefki, and Golisopod also help punish them. Despite its typing, Golurk is not a great check to RU's best Electric-types in Raikou and Xurkitree. Therefore, a reliable check to them such as Assault Vest Reuniclus, Dragalge, or Roserade is recommended. These Pokemon also provide Future Sight or entry hazard support. Since itemless Flygon and the uncommon Tangela are the best defensive switch-ins to Golurk, pairing Golurk with offensive answers to them, such as Noivern, Toxicroak, and Roserade, is recommendable. Strong late-game cleaners such as Choice Scarf Heracross, Gardevoir, and Sharpedo appreciate Golurk's wallbreaking capabilities, while Golurk appreciates their capability to deal with more offense teams, which it struggles with.</p> "

Knock Off allows Tornadus to weaken its typical switch-ins such as Raikou, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Registeel by removing their items. U-turn allows Tornadus to gain momentum and pivot out of disadvantageous matchups. Tailwind is a great move to support slower teammates or give them more sweeping potential. Heat Wave, on the other hand, gives Tornadus a better matchup versus Steel-types such as Metagross, Steelix, and Klefki. Even though Tornadus is not the best defogger in RU, its ability to remove entry hazards safely due to its Prankster Defog can be useful in important situations. Taunt is an option to cripple passive Pokemon such as Porygon2 and Umbreon and to prevent Pokemon such as Barbaracle and Snorlax from setting up on it.

Outside of rain, Focus Blast is Tornadus's strongest option against various targets like Umbreon, Snorlax, Diancie, and Stakataka. Grass Knot hits Milotic and Suicune hardest, while also being an accurate option for other threats like Gastrodon and Golurk. However, Grass Knot covers much less important targets than Tornadus's other coverage, notably even the lightweight Diancie takes negligible damage, and the aforementioned bulky Water-types are all hit hard by Hurricane anyways.</p> <p>Nasty Plot Tornadus has a niche in RU as a strong wallbreaker on many archetypes, especially on rain and hyper offense teams.

The aforementioned two are also able to check Raikou and Xurkitree. Bulky Pokemon such as Milotic, Porygon2, and Assault Vest Reuniclus give Tornadus a reliable defensive backbone, since Tornadus is easily revenge killed by faster Pokemon and Choice Scarf users, such as Noivern, Xurkitree, and Darmanitan.

Strong late-game sweepers such as Choice Scarf Heracross, Xurkitree, and Sharpedo appreciate Tornadus' ability to weaken opponent's team. Tornadus fits well on rain teams, where Politoed is a necessary teammate. Kabutops and Kingdra as strong rain sweepers overwhelm bulkier Pokemon alongside Tornadus. In return, Tornadus checks bulky Water- and Grass-types. Lastly, Tornadus can also be used on dual screens teams, where the screens support give it more setup opportunities. Klefki can set up ideal conditions for Tornadus with dual screens and Spikes. Other strong setup sweepers such as Linoone, Cloyster, and Necrozma are great choices to overwhelm opposing teams.</p> "

However, Talonflame is able to check certain Steel-types such as Metagross and Steelix well, unlike its Flying-type competition. Talonflame is also able to stave off Fighting-types such as Cobalion and Heracross. Will-O-Wisp allows Talonflame to cripple common Flying-resistant Pokemon such as Diancie and Stakataka, Steel-types like Cobalion and Steelix, and setup sweepers like Swords Dance Doublade and Swords Dance Mimikyu. U-turn is helpful to keep momentum and bring in frailer wallbreakers and other teammates. Flare Blitz and Toxic can be run over Brave Bird and Will-O-Wisp to make Talonflame more immediately threatening to Steel-types and Electric-types; Toxic also makes it harder for Water-types to handle it. However, this leaves it without a move to hit Chandelure and is less threatening to Stakataka. Talonflame has the option to run a Swords Dance set with maximum Attack investment as well as Flare Blitz and Swords Dance over U-turn and Will-O-Wisp, which threatens common Flying-resistant Pokemon like Raikou and Steelix. Swords Dance Talonflame still struggles to break past most bulky Water- and Rock-types and loses immense utility by not having U-turn or Will-O-Wisp, however. 240 Speed EVs let Talonflame outspeed Ribombee. While an offensive EV spread is preferred, Talonflame can alternatively run a physically defensive EV spread of 16 HP / 252 Def / 240 Spe to more reliably check Lucario, Dhelmise, and Metagross, but it gives up the ability to guarantee a 2HKO on Chandelure.</p> <p>Talonflame cannot do much to the many Rock- and Water-type Pokemon like Diancie, Milotic, and Gastrodon in the tier, so Celebi, Milotic, and Vileplume make good teammates that are able to switch in and threaten these Pokemon. Vileplume and Celebi are especially notable, as they also handle Electric-types that threaten Talonflame like Raikou and Xurkitree. Talonflame's ability to lure in Rock- and Water-types such as Stakataka, Diancie, and Milotic can give free switches to teammates like Golurk, Decidueye, and Heracross thanks to U-turn. Talonflame appreciates cleric support from Diancie, Vileplume, and Sylveon to reliably handle Toxic users such as Metagross and defensive Stakataka. Talonflame isn't a reliable Fighting-type check on its own, so Mimikyu and Starmie make good teammates for it that are able to assist against Heracross and Cobalion. Knock Off can ruin Talonflame by removing its Heavy-Duty Boots, making it vulnerable to Stealth Rock; Knock Off absorbers like Cobalion, Vileplume, and Gastrodon can take Knock Off for Talonflame.

Sylveon is able to run Calm Mind if your team has a way of pressuring Steel-types and can afford not having Heal Bell support. Sylveon's EVs increase its physical bulk to make it a proper wall to offensive threats such as Flygon and Sharpedo. Sylveon generally fits on more bulky or balanced teams that appreciate its Wish support and useful defensive typing. Bulky Ground-types such as Flygon and Steelix can wear down bulky Steel-types, which then allows Sylveon to move freely or even rack up Calm Minds. In return, Sylveon is able to keep them healthy with its cleric support. Offensive threats like Necrozma can threaten Poison-types like Vileplume and Crobat that annoy Sylveon. Steel-types like Metagross and Cobalion are also useful, since they resist both of Sylveon's weaknesses, while in return Sylveon is able to keep them healthy with Wish.</p> "

Thunder Wave serves as a great form of speed control, allowing Klefki to shut down sweepers such as Polteageist and cripple the likes of Noivern and Crobat. Toxic in the final slot ensures that Klefki has a way to threaten Ground-type Pokemon like Golurk and Electric-type Pokemon like Xurkitree and Raikou, though it is less valuable for faster paced offensive teams, as the gradual poisoning damage doesn't have as many turns to add up. Defog can be used over a status move on teams that need emergency hazard removal; however, Klefki has poor matchups against common hazard setters like Cobalion, Steelix, and Metagross. Foul Play can be used over Toxic in order to give Klefki a way to punish a number of its checks, such as Golurk, Metagross, and Doublade, as they switch in. Magnet Rise is an option that allows Klefki to continue setting Spikes even against certain Ground-type Pokemon like Nidoqueen.

  "Noivern": {
    "overview": "<p>Noivern provides excellent utility to any team as an offensive pivot or Defogger. Its typing and sky-high Speed tier let it check and revenge kill a vast array of common Pokemon such as Volcanion and Cobalion. Noivern excels as a pivot, providing frequent free switches for wallbreakers while forming potent VoltTurn cores with Xurkitree, Raikou, and Flygon. As a Defogger, Noivern has some of the better matchups against common entry hazard setters, being able to threaten Cobalion, Steelix, and Roserade but struggling with Stakataka, Diancie, and Registeel. Noivern's defensive utility is greatly diminished by its reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots, as it can't switch in on Pokemon such as Incineroar, Seismitoad, and Golisopod without the risk of getting hit by Knock Off. Furthermore, Noivern's mediocre Special Attack means it barely scratches special walls like Diancie, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Umbreon while also leaving it as setup fodder for Calm Mind Reuniclus, Necrozma, and Nasty Plot Togekiss. However, Noivern can circumvent its switch-ins by providing a free switch for powerful wallbreakers with U-turn.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Toxic can cripple common switch-ins to Noivern such as Togekiss, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Diancie. With Toxic, Noivern can also act as a hard stop to Calm Mind + Substitute Suicune thanks to Infiltrator. However, using Toxic means giving up on the great utility provided by U-turn or Defog, which is difficult to justify on most teams. A stallbreaker set with Taunt prevents Cobalion, Bronzong, and Registeel from setting Stealth Rock and walls like Milotic, Togekiss, and Snorlax from healing. Generally, Hurricane is the preferred STAB option alongside Taunt because it gives better odds of beating Calm Mind Suicune. Switcheroo can be run alongside Choice Scarf to cripple Noivern's switch-ins such as Registeel, Assault Vest Reuniclus, and Diancie. Swapping items with bulky set-up Pokemon like Snorlax, Reuniclus, and Suicune neutralizes their attempts at a sweep. Noivern is also the fastest Choice Scarf user in RU and can even outspeed and revenge kill +2 Cloyster. However, Choice Scarf sets are greatly limited by Stealth Rock. Rocky Helmet punishes U-turn pivots like Crobat, Flygon, and Darmanitan. It can also be used alongside Taunt to always beat Registeel. The big downfall with Rocky Helmet is that it also leaves Noivern vulnerable to Stealth Rock.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types such as Togekiss, Diancie, and Grimmsnarl wall Noivern. Diancie is especially troublesome for Defog Noivern because it can freely switch in on the turn Noivern uses Defog and set Stealth Rock again. Choice Scarf Gardevoir can revenge kill Noivern, and Mimikyu can use Defog sets as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Special walls such as Assault Vest Reuniclus, Umbreon, Snorlax, and Porygon2 take very little damage from Noivern's attacks. Reuniclus can set up Future Sight or remove an item with Knock Off, Umbreon gets a free Wish for itself or its teammates, Snorlax sets up Curse, and Porygon2 pivots out with Teleport or cripples something with Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Choice Scarf users: Choice Scarf users such as Flygon, Gardevoir, Heracross, and Darmanitan can revenge kill Noivern from full or after a slight bit of prior damage.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Certain Steel-types like Registeel, Stakataka, Bronzong, and Klefki can take Flamethrower from Noivern multiple times. Klefki can also cripple Noivern with Thunder Wave. Cobalion can threaten Noivern on the switch with a Rock-type coverage move in Stone Edge.</p> ",

Heavy-Duty Boots is necessary because Noivern is held down by Stealth Rock otherwise. With Infiltrator, Noivern can ignore Substitute from Volcanion and rare Chandelure sets.</p> <p>Wallbreakers such as Obstagoon, Cobalion, and Entei appreciate the free switch provided by U-turn and take advantage of common switch-ins to Noivern like Assault Vest Reuniclus, Togekiss, and Umbreon.

It is also a reliable Stealth Rock setter that pressures various Defoggers such as Crobat and Noivern with its powerful Diamond Storm, and it provides additional support with Heal Bell. Diamond Storm’s high chance of boosting Diancie’s Defense can make it difficult to revenge kill and strengthens its Body Press, making it less passive. However, Diancie's lack of reliable recovery and susceptibility to entry hazards and status moves make it easy to wear down over the course of the battle or at least force it to be more passive with Heal Bell. Its typing leaves it weak to common threats such as Cobalion, Metagross, Volcanion, and Roserade, as well as the common spinners Dhelmise and Starmie. In addition, Diancie often invites fearsome threats such as Nidoqueen and Golurk in, and setup sweepers such as Reuniclus, Celebi, and Toxicroak can turn it into setup fodder due to its mediocre offensive stats and movepool. Diancie faces competition from other specially defensive Stealth Rock setters such as Registeel, Bronzong, and Stakataka, which have more advantageous typings with important resistances to types like Fairy, Psychic, and Grass to better check threats like Gardevoir and Roserade.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Power Gem has more PP then Diamond Storm, making it better in the long term and against threats such as Xatu and Togekiss. However, Diamond Storm's Defense boosts make it usually better. Moonblast enables Diancie to better deal with Pokemon such as Heracross and Flygon, and its high chance of lowering Special Attack comes in handy against common threats such as Nidoqueen and Calm Mind Reuniclus. Unfortunately, Moonblast is hard to fit over another move. Earth Power is an option for the last moveslot to hit Nidoqueen, Doublade, Toxtricity, and Toxicroak super effectively. However, it does little else and only 3HKOes Nidoqueen, while Doublade and Toxtricity are rather uncommon. Encore better handles Calm Mind Reuniclus but is hard to fit over another move, since it has low use outside of this. More offensive sets such as offensive Trick Room, bulky Calm Mind, Rock Polish sweeper, and Meteor Beam + Power Herb are quite conceivable. However, Pokemon such as Stakataka, Reuniclus, and Necrozma perform these roles much better due to their better offensive stats.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Offensive Steel-types such as Cobalion, Lucario, and Metagross put Diancie under immense pressure with their super effective STAB attacks. However, the former two struggle to switch in, since they take good damage from Diancie's Body Press. Defensive Steel-types such as Steelix and Bronzong take less from Body Press and OHKO Diancie with either Heavy Slam or Gyro Ball. If Registeel lacks Heavy Slam, the best it can do is weaken Diancie with Toxic. Despite being able to OHKO Diancie with Gyro Ball, Stakataka is slower then it and takes a lot from Body Press, especially offensive variants. However, every mentioned Steel-type stumbles as soon as Diancie has a Defense increase from Diamond Storm, since they take more damage from Body Press and cause less damage to it. Doublade easily uses Diancie as setup fodder due its typing and high physical bulk, but Doublade is very uncommon and must watch out for Earth Power.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Nidoqueen and Golurk do heavy damage to Diancie with their powerful STAB moves and easily switch into it, since they take little from its attacks; only Golurk dislikes Toxic. Flygon can pressure Diancie with its strong Earthquake but can lose the matchup if Diancie's Defense is boosted through Diamond Storm. Diancie has also to watch out for Ground-type coverage from Pokemon such as Darmanitan.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types such as Roserade and Rotom-C threaten Diancie with their powerful Grass-type STAB attacks but fail to OHKO Diancie and take a lot from its Diamond Storm. Nasty Plot Celebi with Recover uses Diancie as setup fodder, but utility variants have a rather shaky matchup against it, since Grass Knot does not do much to it. Dhelmise has a high chance to OHKO Diancie and can remove Stealth Rock through Rapid Spin. Bulky Grass-types such as Vileplume have nothing to fear from Diancie.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Bulky Water-types such as Gastrodon, Milotic, and Suicune have little to fear from Diancie's attacks and threaten it with either a burn through Scald or Toxic. However, Gastrodon and Milotic dislike Toxic, though Suicune can play around it with either Rest or Substitute. Offensive Water-types such as Starmie, Sharpedo, and Volcanion take a lot from Diancie's attacks, but once they get a safe switch in, they can either KO a weakened Diancie or force it out with their powerful STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers: Powerful wallbreakers such as Pangoro, Guts Heracross, and Choice Specs Chandelure easily overwhelm Diancie with their attacks. However, they all take a lot from Diancie's attacks.</p> <p><strong>Setup Sweepers: Setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Reuniclus, Nasty Plot Celebi, and Toxicroak take little from Diancie's attacks and do not care about Toxic due to their abilities or typing, which enable them to use Diancie as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Passive Damage and Trick</strong>: Since Diancie lacks recovery besides Leftovers, it is easy to wear it down over time with chip damage from entry hazards and burn or poison. In addition, many Pokemon Diancie switches into can cripple it, such as Chandelure and Darmanitan with Toxic or Entei with Sacred Fire. Diancie can cure its status with Heal Bell, but this makes it more passive. Beyond that, Diancie is a team's main answer to Dark-types, meaning it will often lose its Leftovers quickly through Knock Off from Pokemon such as Incineroar and Obstagoon. Trick users such as Darmanitan, Chandelure, and Gardevoir limit Diancie by giving it a Choice item with Trick and stealing its only recovery in Leftovers.</p> ",

Heal Bell is also a great choice, since it makes Diancie less susceptible to status and can relieve a teammate from the cleric role. Toxic cripples bulky foes such as Gastrodon, Milotic, and Dhelmise and gives a better matchup against Togekiss, since bulky variants can stall out Diamond Storm with Roost. 20 Speed EVs allow Diancie to outspeed Sassy Incineroar. This investment also allows Diancie to outspeed standard Golisopod, and alongside 20 Attack EVs, always activate its Emergency Exit with Diamond Storm. The remaining EVs are invested into HP and Special Defense to better check threats such as Togekiss, Noivern, and Gardevoir. A more physically defensive spread can be run to better check physical threats such as Darmanitan, Entei, and Obstagoon with the nice additional effect of a strong Body Press.</p> <p>Balance and bulky offense teams appreciate Diancie reliably setting Stealth Rock and checking common threats such as Togekiss, Noivern, and Darmanitan.

Bulky Water- and Ground-types such as Milotic, Gastrodon, and defensive Flygon check offensive Steel-types like Cobalion, Metagross, and Lucario. Fighting-types such as Heracross, Pangoro, and Lucario, on the other hand, check defensive Steel-types like Bronzong and Steelix for Diancie. They appreciate its ability to check Flying-types for them and lay down Stealth Rock. Cobalion deserves a special mention, since it can switch into opposing Knock Off and appreciates Diancie taking over its role as a Stealth Rock setter. Umbreon and Vaporeon are great teammates for Diancie, since they provide Wish support and check various threats that Diancie cannot check such as Nidoqueen, Volcanion, and Starmie. In return, Diancie relieves them of the cleric role. Ghost- and Dark-types such as Chandelure, Incineroar, and Obstagoon check Calm Mind Reuniclus, Nasty Plot Celebi, and the common spinners Starmie and Dhelmise reliably, which take huge advantage of Diancie.

Alternatively, Spirit Shackle is a decent option with Knock Off support to pressure Flying-types such as Togekiss, in addition to giving free momentum.

In particular, its higher Speed stat is what differentiates it from Dhelmise and lets it outspeed the whole unboosted metagame after a Rapid Spin. Tsareena's vulnerability to Toxic and difficulty to fit Synthesis make it unable to naturally switch into Electric- and Water-types like Raikou, Xurkitree, and Gastrodon unlike other Grass-types such as Roserade, Vileplume, and Celebi. Knock Off removes crucial items like Heavy-Duty Boots from switch-ins such as Incineroar while not giving away any free switches to Chandelure and Metagross. Triple Axel catches Flying- and Grass-types such as Togekiss, Noivern, and Vileplume on the switch. High Jump Kick, U-turn, and Synthesis are all great options, but without either Knock Off or Triple Axel, Tsareena is left completely vulnerable to common threats like Metagross and Togekiss.

While Flying-types such as Togekiss, Crobat, and Tornadus need to watch out for Triple Axel, they all outspeed and threaten Tsareena with their STAB moves. Metagross, Raikou, and Diancie can check said Flying-types for Tsareena. Poison-types such as Roserade, Salazzle, and Galarian Weezing can either threaten or wall Tsareena. Roserade is especially a nuisance, as it's a Spikes setter that Tsareena loses to. Pokemon such as Crobat can check Roserade while Gastrodon helps with the latter two.

  "Xurkitree": {
    "overview": "<p>Of RU's three best Electric-types, Xurkitree, Raikou, and Toxtricity, Xurkitree is commonly considered the most restrictive and consistently dangerous for one simple reason: Grass-type coverage. Its Heavy-Duty Boots set singlehandedly makes Gastrodon, a strong Raikou answer, insufficient for covering the metagame's Electric-types, and other Ground-types like Steelix and Flygon shaky at best. With Ground-types so hesitant to face Xurkitree, it's free to use Volt Switch on switch-ins like Grass-types and special walls, which are rife with weaknesses for teammates to exploit. It's at its strongest against bulkier cores, which often use slower, exploitable Pokemon like Togekiss and Water-types and which struggle to pressure it with passive damage thanks to its Heavy-Duty Boots. While its Speed and bulk aren't great against offensive teams, it can usually find at least one opportunity to threaten them as well, either by forcing a switch or taking a hit. Should its team call for it, it can use Choice Scarf for greater use against offense and potentially cleaning up with Beast Boost at the expense of threatening defensive cores. What generally holds Xurkitree back is its aforementioned bulk and Speed; it can't switch into many direct attacks, and it often has very little breathing room against offense, areas where Raikou beats it out. Its Choice Scarf set suffers from prediction reliance against Ground-types and failing to outspeed other Choice Scarf users like Heracross and Flygo, limiting its ability to revenge kill and clean up. If you're looking for raw attacking power, you might prefer Toxtricity, whose Boomburst is easier to spam and much stronger than any of Xurkitree's individual attacks.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Endure + Salac Berry has merit on Sticky Web teams, giving Xurkitree the simultaneous benefits of heightened Speed and attack freedom while blocking First Impression and outpacing Choice Scarf users not named Flygon. If you build around Indeedee-M, its Psychic Surge lets Xurkitree run Nature Power to OHKO Roserade, Vileplume, and Nidoqueen.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Roserade, Celebi, Vileplume, and Dhelmise are popular alongside Ground-types to minimize the damage Xurkitree can do, given their Electric resistance and neutrality-at-worst to its coverage. They're vulnerable to Volt Switch, though, so Xurkitree's team will often stay at an advantage, and Vileplume's and Dhelmise's lower Speed means Xurkitree doesn't even need to predict them.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Bulky Pokemon like Diancie, Registeel, Assault Vest Reuniclus, Porygon2, and Umbreon stand up well to Xurkitree's unboosted attacks but are total Volt Switch fodder. They need Heavy-Duty Boots Xurkitree statused or itemless to win a battle of attrition.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Steelix's Grass neutrality makes it the best Ground-type Xurkitree switch-in, though it quickly loses to repeated Grass Knot or Energy Ball. Flygon can take Dazzling Gleam once with the right EVs. Other Ground-types such as Gastrodon and Golurk usually switch out when Xurkitree appears in fear of Grass-type moves but can punish overeager uses of Volt Switch. Any Ground-type is a serious problem for Choice Scarf Xurkitree, creating a cost for locking into Electric-type moves.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: With resistance to Electric and neutrality to Grass and Fairy, other Electric-types like Raikou, Toxtricity, and Xurkitree itself make for decent early-game switch-ins to Xurkitree. Only Toxtricity threatens much damage back, however, and none of them are eager to keep losing HP.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority: Offensive teams featuring a lot of fast Pokemon give Heavy-Duty Boots Xurkitree few easy entry points and seldom lose more than one Pokemon to it. Faster Choice Scarf users like Flygon and Heracross can revenge kill weakened Choice Scarf Xurkitree. The same goes for strong priority from the likes of Golisopod and Lucario.</p> <p><strong>Alolan Marowak: Lighting Rod Alolan Marowak is unique in that it's immune to Electric and resistant to both Grass and Fairy, making it a major early-game obstacle to Xurkitree, but it's uncommon, very flawed, and fairly easy to wear down.</p> ",

Its quadruple Normal resistance makes it one of the tier's better ways to take Toxtricity's Boomburst as well. Unfortunately, since Stakataka's the slowest Pokemon in the tier, it's usually getting hit first and worn down easily, and it is forced to make predictions even when other defensive Pokemon are switching in. Its 4x Ground and Fighting weaknesses mean it finds itself offensively pressured a lot.</p> ",

  "Toxtricity": {
    "overview": "<p>Choice Specs Toxtricity is one of RU's strongest sources of immediate damage thanks to its Punk Rock-boosted Boomburst, which has very few consistent switch-ins. Pokemon with the typing or special bulk to take Boomburst, like Stakataka and Porygon2, are vulnerable to Toxtricity's coverage or lose momentum to Volt Switch. Though slow, Toxtricity poses a massive early-game threat to offensive teams, as staples like Noivern cannot immediately OHKO it and fear getting OHKOed in return. Its resistances let it even switch into and punish Cobalion, Roserade, and Raikou once or twice, especially if they go for utility moves. Once Toxtricity has taken some damage, however, it becomes much less of a threat, as its low Speed and bulk will make it easy for many Pokemon to pick off. Its vulnerability to Stealth Rock and Spikes worsens this issue, especially in a metagame full of pivots using Heavy-Duty Boots, which incentivizes conventional offensive teams to forgo entry hazard removal. It faces competition from RU's other top Electric-types, Raikou and Xurkitree; the former's naturally high Speed lets it remain a threat to offense all game long, while the latter can use Choice Scarf to similarly threaten offense or Heavy-Duty Boots to wallbreak like Toxtricity without fearing entry hazards. Both Electric-types are always faster than offensive Togekiss, which can overcome weakened Toxtricity with Air Slash flinches.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Shift Gear set using Boomburst, Overdrive, Drain Punch, and Life Orb or Throat Spray with maximum Special Attack and Speed investment and a Mild or Hasty nature can be a nasty surprise sweeper that beats and sets up on Porygon2. With so many other sweepers and Choice Scarf users available, including Sharpedo, Cloyster, Mimikyu, Xurkitree, and Heracross, dedicating Toxtricity to the role is usually unnecessary and a waste of its power.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Entry Hazards and Offensive Pressure: Offensive teams often won't have a solid switch-in to Toxtricity beyond a one-time check like Steelix; they bank on trading damage with it or wearing it down with Stealth Rock and Spikes until it's in KO range of faster Pokemon. Toxtricity's unremarkable bulk means this won't take long. Most aggressive teams will also give Toxtricity very few opportunities to directly switch in.</p> <p><strong>Ghost-types: The presence of a Ghost-type forces Toxtricity to think twice about spamming Boomburst, limiting how much damage it can get out of its attack opportunities. Golurk and Lightning Rod Alolan Marowak are even immune to Electric, meaning Toxtricity has to risk using the generally mediocre Snarl or Sludge Bomb. Colbur Berry Dhelmise can take a hit from Toxtricity pretty well. Ghost-types generally work well with Ground-types by maximizing the number of predictions Toxtricity has to make.</p> <p><strong>Porygon2: Punk Rock halves damage taken from sound-based moves, making Trace Porygon2 a very reliable switch-in to Toxtricity, albeit one wide open to Volt Switch.</p> <p><strong>Specially Bulky Pokemon</strong>: Snorlax and Registeel can stand up to Toxtricity's attacks for a while, though they lose momentum to Volt Switch and are easily pressured. Diancie and Stakataka can switch into Boomburst but hate Electric-type attacks. Steelix and Assault Vest Reuniclus can switch into Boomburst once and threaten to KO in return.</p> ",

Volt Switch lets Toxtricity bring a threatening teammate in against relatively consistent checks like Porygon2 and Registeel. Snarl catches the occasional Golurk along with OHKOing Alolan Marowak. Sludge Bomb is an alternative that can poison bulky switch-ins, 2HKOes Alolan Marowak, and OHKOes Trace Gardevoir. Toxtricity's Speed tier isn't crowded, so it can get away with a Modest nature.

Flygon and Incineroar are U-turn users that pivot on switch-ins like Togekiss and Galarian Weezing, which healthy Toxtricity is then free to exploit. They form a VoltTurn core with Toxtricity as well, giving defensive teams a miserable time. Other Fighting-types like Heracross punish bulky Normal- and Steel-types for switching into Boomburst.
