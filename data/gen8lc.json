Finally, because Charmander does not have any coverage moves and sun teams often struggle to fit a Spore absorber, Sleep Talk allows it to fulfill the role of a sleep absorber. Choice Scarf allows Charmander to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and common Choice Scarf users like Mudbray, Porygon, and Magnemite. Charmander requires sun support from from Vulpix. It can break down shared checks for other Fire-types and benefit from other sun sweepers like Ponyta weakening Water-types like Frillish and Mareanie, which are challenging Pokemon to chip down. Fighting-types that lure Mareanie and remove its Eviolite, like Mienfoo and Timburr, also help Charmander. Diglett helps trap Pokemon like the aforementioned Mareanie, Ponyta, and Staryu.</p> "

  "Vulpix": {
    "overview": "<p>Thanks to Drought, Vulpix has incredibly strong Fire-type attacks that make it a rather potent offensive pick, threatening several Pokemon such as Ferroseed and Grookey. At 17 Speed, Vulpix is just fast enough to threaten the likes of Vullaby without a Choice Scarf while being rather easy to revenge kill with unboosted Speed. There is an appeal to doubling up on Fire-type attackers with the support of Drought for dedicated wallbreakers, though a shallow movepool leaves Vulpix unable to do much to overcome its own checks and counters. Vulpix is consigned to being a one dimensional wallbreaker, but very few Pokemon can tank hits from the Fire- and Grass-type coverage that it brings to a team.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Flame Charge is a nice option on non-Choice item sets for boosting Vulpix's Speed to outspeed the unboosted tier. Eject Pack allows Vulpix to use Overheat and immediately switch out to bring in Diglett to trap the likely Fire-resistant Pokemon on the field. Heat Rock gives additional turns of Sun, turning Vulpix into a niche support Pokemon for unorthodox picks such as Solar Blade Ponyta and Choice Scarf Charmander. This is not generally recommended, though, as these teams end up with large defensive gaps and heavily rely on being able to win with these fast Fire-types. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Vulpix to avoid taking entry hazard damage, but the benefits of Heat Rock often outweigh the advantages of it. Memento can be used in conjunction with a setup sweeper, such as Woobat or Shellder.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: As Water-types with Recover, Staryu, Mareanie, Shellos, and Frillish are all rather sturdy answers to Vulpix's sun-boosted attacks. Mareanie is particularly resilient owing to its ability Regenerator. Staryu does need to beware Choice Scarf Vulpix hitting it with Energy Ball on the switch, but this is not too troublesome.</p> <p><strong>Ponyta: As the main other Fire-resistant Pokemon in the tier with recovery, Ponyta is a major issue for Vulpix. Drought powers up Ponyta, making it more difficult to switch into while also causing Morning Sun to heal Ponyta for another quarter of its health. Ponyta may run Flash Fire to absorb Fire-type attacks and completely wall Vulpix, though Ponyta is still a sufficient check without it.</p> <p><strong>Priority and Entry Hazards</strong>: Vulpix is frail enough that taking a quarter of its health upon switching in greatly limits its potential. Onix is a common Stealth Rock setter and is able to switch into Vulpix's Fire-type attacks somewhat well. Chip damage in general is how more offensive teams will overcome Vulpix generally, as Fake Out or Sucker Punch with entry hazards up is enough to keep Vulpix from cleaning up teams throughout the game.</p> ",

        "name": "Choice Item",
        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Weather Ball is Vulpix's strongest accurate STAB move when sun is up, but it requires sun to actually be useful. Overheat is incredibly strong and can be used to break through several Pokemon, such as scoring the OHKO on Vullaby. Energy Ball is chiefly for Onix and Staryu and the only coverage option worth running. Hypnosis allows for Vulpix to try to put a Pokemon to sleep on a forced switch, which can be valuable when facing teams with Mareanie or Ponyta. Fire Blast is a powerful attack, but it should be used in situations where you do not want to be locked into Overheat or Weather Ball, such as sun disappearing or having the need to switch out. That being said, running three Fire-type attacks can be cumbersome.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>The EV spread simply makes Vulpix as fast and powerful as possible. With a Timid nature, Vulpix reaches 17 Speed, outspeeding Vullaby and Speed tying with Mienfoo. The remaining EVs go into HP in order to give Vulpix one more switch into Stealth Rock. With Choice Scarf, Vulpix becomes one of the better revenge killers in the tier, outspeeding Dragon Dance Scraggy and Choice Scarf Pawniard. Choice Scarf also allows Vulpix to assume the role of a late-game cleaner. Choice Specs instead doubles down on Vulpix's threatening Fire-type attacks in order to make it a ferocious wallbreaker.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Vulpix is too frail to switchin on any neutral attack and is weak to entry hazards, which consequently means that getting it into play is a challenge. Intelligent double switches or pivoting moves such as U-turn are key components to getting Vulpix in. From there, it is often as straightforward as using the appropriate Fire-type attack while occasionally using Energy Ball to catch Staryu or Onix on the switch. Vulpix can also catch common switch-ins, such as Ponyta and Mareanie, and cripple them severely with Hypnosis. Do be mindful of Drought turns, as Vulpix without sun in play is no threat at all. Vulpix is easily threatened by all faster Pokemon and priority attacks and therefore should usually be switching out of these matchups.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Vulpix's success is determinant on coming in safely, making bulky Mienfoo one of the best partners for it available in the tier, as it can cripple Mareanie with Knock Off and force Onix out. Due to its ability to trap and remove all of the hard stops to Vulpix available in the tier, such as Ponyta and Mareanie, Diglett is often a very important teammate. Hazard removal is absolutely necessary, leading Vullaby and Staryu to be highly recommended teammates. As Vulpix will struggle with opposing Water-types and make great use of Stealth Rock, Ferroseed is highly recommended. Pawniard assists with Stealth Rock and Knock Off support as a more offensive option. Ponyta and Choice Scarf Charmander pair with Vulpix well, as they both are capable attackers with sun support. Choice Specs Vulpix specifically does well with Thunder Wave support, making Slowpoke and Porygon worthy teammates as well.</p> "

Fake Out also breaks Sturdy and Focus Sash reliably, as well as helping against opposing priority users, such as weakened Timburr. Double-Edge is Meowth's strongest move; combined with Fake Out, it turns Meowth into a powerful wallbreaker, but it should be used sparingly due to the large amounts of recoil it can rack up. Water Pulse hits Onix, Dwebble, and Archen. With Fake Out, Meowth can beat SturdyJuice Onix and Dwebble as well. U-turn can be run over Water Pulse to escape bad matchups against Pokemon like Pawniard and Ferroseed. Additionally, not many Pokemon can tank Fake Out into Double-Edge, so Meowth can force many switches. It can take advantage of this to maintain momentum with U-turn. Knock Off can be run to weaken its checks, as Meowth can lure in Fighting- and Steel-types like Timburr and Ferroseed, which don't appreciate losing their Eviolite. Knock Off also prevents Regenerator cores from blocking Meowth.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Technician increases the power of Meowth's low BP moves, and Life Orb is used to boost its otherwise lacking power. 36 SpA EVs allow Meowth to KO Archen after Fake Out chip damage, and 19 HP IVs are used to limit Life Orb recoil. A Naughty nature strengthens Meowth's STAB moves and doesn't weaken Water Pulse, but U-turn variants should run an Adamant nature and an EV spread of 236 Atk / 76 Def / 196 Spe.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Meowth is extremely frail, so it shouldn't switch into attacks. Instead, aim to get it into the field through slow U-turns, double switches, or revenge killing opportunities. Faster Pokemon like Abra can run Protect—try to scout their sets to use Meowth's priority effectively. Feint can break through Protect, leaving them vulnerable to another Feint. Meowth can take the most advantage of its toolkit mid- or late-game when the opposing team is sufficiently weakened, so take care to preserve it until then. Always try to scout Onix and Dwebble to ensure you don't hit Weak Armor sets with Fake Out or Sturdy sets with Water Pulse. Making the right choice can potentially mean eliminating an entry hazard lead. U-turn variants should try to predict when Steel- and Fighting-types that wall Meowth, such as Pawniard and Timburr, might come in to maintain momentum.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard setters like Dwebble, Ferroseed, and Onix synergize well with Meowth chipping the opponent's team, especially if it carries U-turn. Knock Off users like Pawniard and Mienfoo allow Meowth to threaten even bulky teams, as few itemless Pokemon can take Fake Out into Double-Edge after entry hazards. Meowth appreciates having pivots such as Mienfoo and Grookey to guarantee a safe switch-in, chip foes, and maintain offensive momentum. If running Water Pulse, try pairing it with Pokemon that appreciate the removal of Rock-types like Ponyta to form wallbreaking cores. Meowth is entirely walled by Steel-types such as Pawniard, Ferroseed, and Magnemite, so partners like Mienfoo, Timburr, and Trapinch can take care of these.</p> "

Grookey makes a good partner, as it can check Water- and Ground-types for Ponyta and weaken Diglett's and Trapinch's Earthquakes; it also appreciates Ponyta's breaking through common defensive cores such as Ferroseed + Mareanie. Fast Water-types have good offensive synergy with Ponyta, which handles Grookey for them; Carvanha can lure in exploitable foes such as Ferroseed and safely bring Ponyta in with Flip Turn, while Staryu can threaten foes like Mareanie and Onix and provide Rapid Spin support. Knock Off support from teammates like Mienfoo, Pawniard, and Ferroseed softens checks like Mareanie to help Ponyta sweep late-game. Ponyta is often seen on sun teams together with Vulpix and Charmander, where Ponyta helps to break through the three Fire-types' shared counters with its power and strong coverage. A teammate capable of counter-trapping opposing Diglett, such as Trapinch, Air Balloon Diglett, or Trace Porygon, gives Ponyta much more flexibility against teams using Diglett; an ally Diglett can also trap Staryu and Mareanie.

    "overview": "<p>Slowpoke's typing and bulk allow it to act as a blanket check to many Pokemon, such as Onix and Staryu, as well as check Psychic- and Fire-types effectively. Moreover, Slowpoke sports a handful of great utility moves. These include Teleport, which synergizes well with Regenerator and allows a teammate to be brought in safely, and Slack Off, which gives it reliable healing, as well as Scald, Thunder Wave, and Fire Blast. However, Slowpoke is very slow, and its typing leaves it with weaknesses to STAB attacks from common presences such as Vullaby, Pawniard, Grookey, and Magnemite as well as common coverage from Pokemon Slowpoke tends to soft check throughout a match, such as Staryu's Thunderbolt, Timburr's and Mienfoo's Knock Off, and U-turn from a number of threats.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Thunder Wave can be used to cripple opposing Pokemon, which a slower teammate can take advantage of. Fire Blast threatens Ferroseed and Pawniard, and it eases prediction against teams carrying both Foongus and Pawniard. Zap Cannon super effectively hits the likes of Flying- and Water-types, but its inconsistent accuracy often makes it a poor choice.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Knock Off and U-turn: Knock Off and U-turn are widespread moves that hit Slowpoke super effectively. Knock Off hinders Slowpoke in the long run and can be used quite easily on Slowpoke, since it is slow. Pokemon Slowpoke soft checks such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Mareanie can pack Knock Off. U-turn makes gaining momentum against Slowpoke by forcing it out a breeze, which can prove detrimental to teams needing the momentum Slowpoke could offer.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Vullaby, Pawniard, and Scraggy are immune to Slowpoke's Psychic-type moves and can take advantage of it being on the field. Pawniard can freely set Stealth Rock, and Nasty Plot Vullaby and Scraggy can set up on Slowpoke. Furthermore, Dark-types tend to pack a dreaded STAB Knock Off, threatening Slowpoke with an OHKO, and Vullaby can pack U-turn. However, these Dark-types dislike Scald burns and Thunder Wave, and Pawniard must beware of Fire Blast.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Ferroseed can take the free turns Slowpoke gives it to stack entry hazards, remove items with Knock Off, or spread paralysis. Grookey threatens Slowpoke with Grassy Glide and Wood Hammer, and it can set a Swords Dance up upon forcing Slowpoke out, which makes it an even bigger threat. Foongus can 2HKO Slowpoke with Giga Drain, but it struggles against Slowpoke's Psychic. Slowpoke's Grass-type switch-ins must, however, be wary of the rare Fire Blast, and Grookey and Ferroseed also dislike Scald burns.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Magnemite can come in and use Volt Switch on Slowpoke very freely, although it dislikes being burned by Scald. It must also account for Fire Blast. Chinchou isn't bothered by these but dislikes switching in repeatedly, especially on Psychic-type moves.</p> ",

        "description": "<h1>Moves</h1> <p>Scald threatens common switch-ins such as Pawniard, Vullaby, and Ferroseed with a burn. Future Sight is Slowpoke's main way of applying offensive pressure to foes, taking advantage of Slowpoke forcing Pokemon such as Foongus, Koffing, Mareanie, and Ponyta out and Psychic-resistant Pokemon in, which can be taken advantage of by teammates. Psychic is an alternative to Future Sight that allows it to hit foes directly. Teleport synergizes with Future Sight and Regenerator and can allow a threatening teammate to get on the field safely.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Regenerator allows Slowpoke to repeatedly switch into the likes of Abra, Vulpix, and Ponyta and check them throughout the game. 116 HP EVs give Slowpoke 27 HP, which means it will recover 9 HP with Regenerator. Both defenses reach even numbers to get the most out of Eviolite's boosts. The maximized Special Defense patches up Slowpoke's low natural special bulk. The EVs dumped into Special Attack ensure it can 2HKO Foongus with Psychic or deal decent damage to most targets with Future Sight. A spread more focused on physical bulk of 116 HP / 236 Def / 116 SpA / 36 SpD can be used, which allows Slowpoke to check Mudbray and Onix better at the cost of compromising special bulk. Slowpoke's Eviolite is very important to maintain its bulk in order to check threats throughout the game.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Slowpoke should be switched in against Pokemon it checks or soft checks when it is healthy. It should focus on finding room to launch Future Sight if running this attack and making good use of Teleport, taking advantage of forced switches to bring in threatening Pokemon safely. When its health is low, Slowpoke should be switched out to recover HP thanks to Regenerator. It can also use Slack Off when up against Pokemon it checks to keep itself healthy. Slowpoke should be wary of Knock Off, since it can reduce its effectiveness for the remainder of the game. As such, switching it in on Pokemon that oftentimes carry Knock Off such as Timburr and Mienfoo isn't a wise decision, even if Slowpoke resists their STAB moves and could otherwise freely switch in to be eligible for Regenerator. Scald should be used to threaten its usual switch-ins in Pawniard, Vullaby, and Ferroseed and when firing off a Future Sight isn't needed.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>As Slowpoke is very weak to Knock Off, Knock Off absorbers such as Mienfoo, Timburr, and Spritzee are great teammates. They like Slowpoke's ability to handle Psychic-, Fire-, and Poison-types and can handle the Dark-types Slowpoke tends to invite in. Fighting-types like Mienfoo and Timburr also provide Knock Off support and can handle the Steel-types that Slowpoke often invites in well. Mienfoo and Slowpoke form a fairly good Regenerator core due to their pivoting moves, whereas Timburr can provide hazard removal to a team. Poison-types such as Foongus and Koffing handle Grookey and can remove Toxic Spikes from the field, which Slowpoke greatly appreciates. In turn, Slowpoke can handle threatening Psychic- and Fire-types for them. Ponyta can also check Grookey for Slowpoke and likes Slowpoke soft checking Water-types. Pokemon such as Grookey, Magnemite, and Vullaby form a VoltTurn core with Slowpoke and can cover some of its weaknesses. Strong attackers such as Choice item Mienfoo and Vulpix like Teleport support and Future Sight preventing common checks from stomaching an attack. Lastly, trappers such as Diglett and Trapinch can remove troublesome foes for Slowpoke, such as Magnemite and Pawniard, and like Teleport support.</p> "

Sludge Bomb is a powerful and reliable STAB move that can further chip foes with its high poison chance. Fire Blast is often Koffing's best midground attack, hitting Steel-types such as Ferroseed and Pawniard super effectively and doing decent damage to Ground-types like Mudbray and Eviolite Diglett. Thunderbolt hits common switch-ins like Mareanie, Staryu, and Natu for super effective damage. Pain Split allows Koffing to stay healthy enough to repeatedly check foes like Mienfoo, and it's often the most reliable way of damaging bulky foes like Frillish. Thief instead allows it to recover its Eviolite if it takes Knock Off and make progress against checks like Frillish and Natu. Lastly, Will-O-Wisp cripples many of Koffing's best answers, such as Mudbray and Onix. Neutralizing Gas denies Regenerator recovery from foes such as Mienfoo and Mareanie, allowing it to consistently make progress, while also making it immune to trapping. 156 Speed EVs allow Koffing to outspeed opposing Mareanie.

Steel-types like Ferroseed and Pawniard are important teammates for switching into opposing Psychic-types and Porygon. Natu can switch into opposing Natu and Mudbray and serve as a secondary Grookey check. Pokemon that can check Ground- and Rock-types, such as Staryu, also make great teammates. Onix has good defensive synergy with Koffing and can sweep teams when opposing Mienfoo are weakened.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Magby can run a mixed Life Orb set with Fire Blast, Psychic, Thunder Punch, and Mach Punch with 15/15 attacking stats; this set, however, is heavily outclassed by Ponyta as a 19 Speed Fire-type and by Vulpix as a Fire-type wallbreaker. This set is also worn down very quickly by Life Orb recoil and entry hazards. Magby struggles to run any moves not already listed on its main set. Brick Break is an option to get past bulky checks like Onix without prior chip damage, but the cost of dropping Thunder Punch or Mach Punch is too high. Dual Chop allows Magby to break the Focus Sashes of Pokemon like Abra; however, Dual Chop is otherwise useless. Protect can be used to avoid the damage from Fake Out, but giving up a coverage move entirely is ill-advised, especially when considering Flame Body can also punish Fake Out.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Priority: Priority in the form of Fake Out from Mienfoo or Grookey, or from Pokemon bulky enough to survive +6 Mach Punch, like Timburr, can chip Magby and knock it out before a sweep can happen.</p> <p><strong>19-20 Speed Pokemon: Healthy 19 Speed Pokemon like Staryu and Galarian Ponyta can put an end to Magby's sweep by winning the Speed tie. Eviolite Diglett can survive a +6 Mach Punch from full and OHKO back with Earthquake. Abra is of special note, as it often carries a Focus Sash, which guarantees that it will be able to survive one hit and OHKO with Psychic.</p> <p><strong>Onix: Onix is incredibly bulky and can survive a Mach Punch even after Magby has set up.

Thunder Punch serves as Magby's best coverage move, allowing it to hit Water-types like Mareanie and Frillish, which would otherwise stop a sweep. Mach Punch hits Rock-types that resist Fire Punch like Onix and Tyrunt; it also allows Magby to beat slower priority users like Pawniard and faster Pokemon like Choice Scarf Porygon.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>29 HP IVs drop Magby's HP to an even number so that Belly Drum activates Berry Juice, restoring Magby back to full HP. The given EVs and nature maximize Magby's Speed and Attack, letting it reach a high 19 Speed. Vital Spirit allows Magby to absorb Spore and set up on Foongus. Alternatively, Flame Body gives it a chance to burn priority users, which means that a Fake Out from Mienfoo or Grookey might stop them from interrupting Magby's sweep.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Magby should be brought in on double switches, after a sacrifice, with Teleport after dual screens have been set, or after a Memento, as it is incredibly frail and will not be able to take advantage of Belly Drum if it is chipped. Magby excels at cleaning weakened teams, so Magby teams should actively search for opportunities to sweep once checks like Onix and Staryu have been weakened. After Magby has a clear path to winning the game, carefully select a chance to use Belly Drum, as it can only use Belly Drum once. Magby's Speed can also let it force out foes to get a setup opportunity.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Natu or another dual screens setter is almost a must-bring; without one, Magby's chances to set up are severely limited. Magby also enjoys not getting chipped when it switches in, meaning that Teleport support from the aforementioned Natu or Memento support from Diglett greatly helps it. Magby also synergizes well with other common dual screens sweepers that are also checked by Onix, like Tyrunt; this is because they each weaken Onix for the others to sweep.</p> "

Pawniard can punish Defog with Defiant and therefore makes for a good partner. Frillish is immune to Rapid Spin and is able to switch in against the most prominent user of the move, Staryu, making it a good pick on entry hazard-stacking teams.

Berry Juice restores its HP to full, which reduces Dwebble’s susceptibility to being picked off by weak priority moves.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Try to avoid switching Dwebble into entry hazards at all costs, since this will stop Sturdy from activating and will prevent a safe setup with Shell Smash. Avoid being hit by Knock Off as well, since Dwebble's item is important to give it setup opportunities. Dwebble should be used as a late-game sweeper, setting up when its checks are sufficiently weakened. Try to bring Dwebble in on a free switch, such as after a Pokemon has fainted or via a slow U-turn, so it doesn't lose its Berry Juice early by switching into an attack. Weaken or remove bulky Pokemon like Mudbray, Spritzee, and Timburr before attempting to sweep with Dwebble, because they can take even a boosted hit and retaliate for lots of damage. Try to remove priority move users, as they can easily pick off Dwebble after its defenses are lowered by Shell Smash. With Sturdy intact, Dwebble can also act as a countermeasure for opposing sweepers that don't have multi-hit moves.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazards from Pokemon like Ferroseed and Pawniard wear down opposing Pokemon, allowing Dwebble to KO more foes. A teammate that provides entry hazard removal such as Staryu, Defog Timburr, or Vullaby, is essential for helping to preserve Dwebble's Sturdy. Pokemon that can bring Dwebble in safely like U-turn Mienfoo and Vullaby are good partners. Pokemon like Giga Drain Ferroseed and Staryu that deal with bulky Ground-types are helpful. Mareanie and Spritzee are good team choices as well because they can deal with Timburr. Trappers such as Diglett and Wynaut help Dwebble by removing or weakening its defensive checks. Knock Off support from Pokemon like Timburr and Mareanie is appreciated, since very few Pokemon will be able to take Dwebble's boosted moves without an Eviolite.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Archen is a classic glass cannon with its huge Attack stat and high-powered STAB moves. With a solid Speed tier and dangerous STAB combination that threatens common Pokemon like Mienfoo and Foongus, Archen can provide strong offensive pressure and capitalize on its ability to force switches. It also has a wide range of coverage moves to beat its checks and utility options like Stealth Rock, Defog, Knock Off, and U-turn to support its team. However, Archen is frail, has a crippling ability that forces it to always remain above 50% HP to deal consistent damage, and has a mediocre typing. Its Speed tier also makes Archen vulnerable to faster threats like Staryu and Abra as well as Choice Scarf users like Porygon and Mienfoo. All these traits make Archen difficult to use and fit on many teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>U-turn lets Archen pivot against checks like Mudbray and bring in a teammate. Archen can function as either a Stealth Rock setter or entry hazard remover, but it is threatened by the prevalent Staryu, which makes it unable to set Stealth Rock effectively, and forced out by common Stealth Rock setters like Mudbray and Pawniard. Knock Off provides helpful utility, allowing Archen to cripple its checks or assist in breaking down opposing Pokemon for its teammates. Substitute blocks status, helps activate Berry Juice, and provides a free opportunity for Archen to attack. Choice Scarf turns Archen into a revenge killer and late-game cleaner, but it limits Archen's opportunities to switch in.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Rock-, Steel-, and Ground-types: Pokemon such as Onix, Pawniard, and Mudbray can switch into Archen's STAB moves and KO it, but they must be wary of its coverage options.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users: Priority users such as Grookey, Timburr, and Pawniard can limit Archen's effectiveness by putting it into Defeatist range. Grookey in particular threatens to OHKO Archen with Grassy Glide.</p> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Threats: Naturally faster Pokemon such as Abra, Staryu, and Diglett, as well as Choice Scarf users like Mienfoo and Porygon, outspeed and threaten Archen.</p> ",

Dual Wingbeat is a more consistent option that breaks Focus Sash from Abra and does more damage before Berry Juice is consumed. Head Smash is Archen's most powerful STAB attack but inflicts recoil; this recoil damage can be useful for activating Berry Juice, but it may also put Archen into Defeatist range. Rock Blast breaks Focus Sash from Abra and Sturdy from Dwebble while also not having recoil. Earthquake deals solid damage to checks like Pawniard and Onix. Heat Wave allows Archen to beat Ferroseed while maintaining coverage for Pawniard and Magnemite. Aqua Tail can be used to lure and surprise Ground- and Rock-type switch-ins, OHKOing non-Sturdy Onix and punishing Mudbray. Roost synergizes with Eviolite and provides helpful recovery to avoid dropping into Defeatist range.</p> <h1>Set Details</h1> <p>Defeatist is Archen's only ability and forces it to remain above 50% HP in order to deal consistent damage. Berry Juice provides recovery and helps Archen stay out of Defeatist range while also synergizing with Acrobatics. Eviolite is an option on Dual Wingbeat sets for extra bulk. A Naive nature can be used over a Jolly nature to boost the power of Heat Wave.</p> <h1>Usage Tips</h1> <p>Archen is ideally brought onto the field safely by a slow pivot, double switch, or after a teammate has fainted to wreak havoc against metagame staples like Timburr and Foongus. It is difficult for teams to check Archen that has not been scouted, as using the correct coverage move can result in the loss of a check, so make sure to utilize the amount of switches it forces. Stealth Rock should be removed before Archen switches in to prevent being put into Defeatist range. Archen has to try to play around priority as well as faster threats that can inflict heavy damage like Staryu, Abra, and Choice Scarf Mienfoo, so it is important to try to scout as best as possible before bringing it in against these Pokemon.</p> <h1>Team Options</h1> <p>Entry hazard removal from Staryu and Defog Timburr is crucial to keeping Archen healthy. Entry hazard setters like Pawniard and Ferroseed put foes into KO range, with Pawniard also helping check threats like Abra and Galarian Ponyta and Ferroseed checking Staryu. Knock Off support from Mienfoo, Timburr, and Pawniard weaken bulky foes like Mudbray and Ferroseed; they also help absorb Knock Off. Pivots such as Mienfoo, Magnemite, and U-turn Grookey help bring Archen in safely. Trappers like Diglett and Trapinch can eliminate Stealth Rock setters and opposing Rock- and Ground-types. Koffing and Foongus are helpful teammates for Archen, as they are able to switch into strong Fighting-type attacks and function as a check to Grookey.</p> "
