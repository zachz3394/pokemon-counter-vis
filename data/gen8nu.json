  "Blastoise": {
    "overview": "<p>With Shell Smash in its arsenal, Blastoise is capable of sweeping weakened teams and is a staple on offensive playstyles. It has enough natural bulk to secure setup opportunities on passive Pokemon like Sylveon and Vaporeon, and its Speed is crucially high enough to prevent Choice Scarf users like Passimian and Rotom-C from revenge killing it after setting up. Its defensive counterplay is limited, as Toxic users like Mudsdale and Vaporeon are unable to deter Substitute variants, and tanks like Stealth Rock Copperajah and Dragalge are only able to KO it with chip damage; they may even inadvertently buff Blastoise by weakening it into Torrent range. Nonetheless, Blastoise is likely to sustain noteworthy damage when setting up, which in turn makes it easier for the aforementioned walls and priority users like Decidueye and Sirfetch'd to deal with it. Some bulky Pokemon like Assault Vest Copperajah, Haze Mantine, and specially defensive Dhelmise check Blastoise even without prior chip damage. Blastoise will also struggle to set up against offensive teams that pressure it with faster wallbreakers and sweepers as well as against teams with ample entry hazard and Knock Off support to make Blastoise much more vulnerable to revenge killers like Choice Scarf Heliolisk.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Blastoise may opt for a defensive utility set that offers Rapid Spin, Flip Turn, and status support, although this set is less effective than other defensive Water-types like Mantine and Vaporeon. Life Orb has the niche of picking up more OHKOs at +2, like against Dragalge and Silvally-Ghost, but these KOs are also obtainable with entry hazard damage. This makes Life Orb usually not worth the recoil combined with the lack of White Herb. Aura Sphere hits notable targets like Heliolisk and Assault Vest Copperajah, but outside of the improved matchup for these threats, Blastoise has better options for sweeping.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Despite being passive, Mantine and Vaporeon use Haze and recovery to outlast Blastoise and prevent it from sweeping.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls</strong>: A handful of special tanks and Assault Vest users like Copperajah and Dhelmise are capable of surviving a hit and OHKOing Blastoise. Other walls such as Escavalier and Guzzlord can stomach a boosted hit as well, but with usually only weaker attacks and Toxic to threaten Blastoise, they are more situational checks.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Heliolisk is one of the only Choice Scarf users capable of revenge killing Blastoise and can even tank a boosted hit if Thunderbolt fails to OHKO. Priority users like Sirfetch'd and Decidueye dispatch Blastoise when its in Torrent range, and offensive Water-types like Starmie check non-Dark Pulse variants.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Entry hazards and Knock Off wear down Blastoise and make it much more susceptible to being KOed, thus expanding its revenge killers and limiting its setup chances.</p> ",

Additional sweepers and wallbreakers like Salazzle, Tyrantrum, and Decidueye break down walls like Mantine and Dhelmise and keep momentum up for an eventual Blastoise sweep. On less offensive teams, Blastoise is more likely to sweep with defensive cores of Copperajah + Sylveon and Bronzong + Vileplume wearing down foes through status, Stealth Rock, and item removal; in return, Blastoise is a crucial Fire-type check. Knock Off support from Passimian and Guzzlord is another great way to wear down Blastoise's defensive checks such as Mantine and Copperajah. Pivots such as Dragalge and Ninjask get Blastoise in safely against targets it's able to use Shell Smash on like Bronzong and Arcanine.</p> "

However, Sandslash's low Special Defense hurts it against foes that can retaliate after taking an unboosted hit, like Vaporeon and Blastoise.

Knock Off cripples the longevity of many of its common checks such as Mudsdale, Diancie, and Talonflame, but Scyther itself is vulnerable to losing its item, which exposes its terrible Stealth Rock weakness and average bulk.

Also, Vaporeon's passivity leaves it easily exploited by threats like Rotom-C, Vileplume, and Decidueye.

    "overview": "<p>Phenomenal bulk, good Attack, excellent coverage, and access to Curse make Snorlax a formidable setup sweeper in NU, capable of decimating many teams once afforded a chance to set up. Snorlax's longevity gives it the edge in many matchups, able to survive hits from powerful physical attackers like Tauros and Guzzlord with a few Defense boosts and healing with Rest. In addition, Snorlax finds setup chances often due to its great natural bulk turning defensive Pokemon such as Mantine, Sylveon, and Vaporeon into setup fodder. Even in matchups where sweeping is unlikely, this bulk and Body Slam's paralysis chance give Snorlax good general utility. However, Snorlax's reliance on Rest for recovery leaves it open to a variety of Pokemon that can stop its sweep. Its dismal Speed leaves it very vulnerable to item removal, status, and a slew of dangerous wallbreakers, all of which can force it to use Rest early or negate its sweeping potential entirely. On top of this, Snorlax's typing gives it almost no relevant defensive benefits, even if it opts to use Thick Fat, and gives it a very common and exploitable weakness in Fighting. Snorlax's sweeping ability can be highly matchup reliant, as it will rarely get past certain threats such as Vileplume, Golurk, Escavalier, and Diancie without the right coverage move.</p> ",

However, it comes at the cost of either super effective damage on Steel-types or the utility of Body Slam, making it a generally subpar option. Heavy Slam can be used to let Snorlax lure in Diancie, but it is rarely worthwhile because it targets little else of note. Snorlax can also surprise its checks with more offensive sets: Assault Vest increases Snorlax's coverage while retaining its special walling capabilities, Choice Band can hit traditional walls like Mudsdale, Diancie, and Escavalier very hard, and a set with three attacks, Protect or Rest, and Leftovers allows Snorlax to both increase its immediate offense and preserve its longevity.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon and Coverage: Sirfetch'd, Machamp, Toxicroak, and Passimian can all force huge damage on Snorlax, even after it has begun to set up. The former two especially can OHKO Snorlax with Choice Band- or Guts-boosted Close Combat, even after a Curse. Several physical attackers that naturally check Snorlax, such as Escavalier and Tauros, commonly run Close Combat to deal with it. Snorlax is also prone to being caught off guard by coverage moves such as Focus Blast from Heliolisk and Superpower from Copperajah, which 2HKO it on the switch or force it to use Rest early.</p> <p><strong>Trick: Trick users, including Rotom-C and Indeedee-F, can almost totally negate Snorlax's usefulness by locking it into one move. This prevents Snorlax from setting up, deprives it of valuable Leftovers recovery, and leaves it only able to fire off weak, unboosted attacks.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers: Due to Snorlax's extreme vulnerability while using Rest, any special attacker that can 3HKO it during that time threatens to stop a boosted Snorlax in its tracks. Very strong Choice Specs users like Exploud, Indeedee-F, and Sylveon are notable examples.</p> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Diancie and Mudsdale can use Snorlax to boost their Defense with Diamond Storm or Stamina and hit it with Body Press. Weezing can burn Snorlax, take advantage of its enormous HP with Pain Split, and shut it down with Taunt. Doublade can switch in and set up Swords Dance easily against Snorlax, forcing it out with the threat of Close Combat. Vileplume can disrupt Snorlax with Corrosive Gas and Strength Sap but falters against Fire Punch sets. Due to Unaware, Quagsire can completely prevent Snorlax from sweeping.</p> ",

Immunity allows Snorlax to nullify Toxic from defensive Pokemon such as Mantine and Mudsdale and more easily take Dragalge's Sludge Bomb, lessening the need to use Rest often. Alternatively, Thick Fat can help Snorlax take Fire- and Ice-type attacks from Salazzle and Vanilluxe. The given EV spread maximizes Snorlax's mixed bulk, notably letting it avoid the 2HKO from Choice Specs Indeedee-F's Expanding Force and Exploud's Focus Blast at full health. However, Snorlax's EVs are fairly customizable, especially if its team can adequately deal with these threats. For example, a spread of 76 HP / 8 Atk / 252 Def / 172 SpD with a Careful nature better optimizes the Blastoise matchup, letting Snorlax always 2HKO Blastoise with +1 Body Slam and almost always avoid the 2HKO from +2 Surf.

Since Snorlax struggles to break through certain physical walls, particularly Diancie, Mudsdale, and Vileplume, wallbreakers such as Starmie, Silvally-Ground, and Duraludon are great teammates.

Additionally, with Teleport, Xatu can guarantee safe entry for both potent wallbreakers and setup sweepers, which has made it the staple dual screens setter on hyper offense teams and sets it apart from other dual screens setters like Espeon. Where Xatu comes short, though, is in its passivity. Despite Teleport helping it keep up momentum, its low offensive prowess still causes it to cede turns to potent wallbreakers like Starmie, Tyrantrum, and Guzzlord. Additionally, its poor defensive stats make it less effective at directly switching into coverage attacks from the likes of Sirfetch'd and Machamp and force it to use Roost very frequently to stay healthy.

This issue in particular can have major consequences; common defensive Pokemon like Escavalier, Sylveon, and Copperajah OHKO Sneasel if they manage to survive its hits. Sneasel's frailty and awful defensive typing hold it back, too.

    "overview": "<p>The biggest benefit to using Rotom-C is its nearly unblockable Volt Switch. Rotom-C's Speed and STAB Leaf Storm prevent Ground-types from reliably denying it from generating momentum, and, although plenty of Pokemon take negligible damage from its attacks, they cannot prevent it from freely pivoting and bringing in terrifying wallbreakers. It's also the best Choice Scarf user in the tier, revenge killing key Pokemon like Talonflame and Starmie, still pivoting very effectively, and providing a source of entry hazard removal. Add Nasty Plot into the mix, and you've got a Pokemon with great use at every stage of the game, be it pivoting and slowly chipping away at checks early- and mid-game or cleaning teams with boosted attacks late-game. Despite all of this, there are still solid defensive stops to Rotom-C like Dragalge and Guzzlord that prevent it from easily sweeping teams and lower the impact of repeated Volt Switches. Additionally, because Rotom-C's Speed tier isn't all that impressive, aggressive double switches into faster revenge killers like Drapion and Salazzle can keep it from continuously generating momentum with Volt Switch. Choice Scarf sets also struggle with this, especially against Protect users like Vaporeon.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Yache Berry helps Rotom-C check Shell Smash Blastoise in a pinch but lacks much other use. Going itemless is an option for blocking Poltergeist from Golurk and Decidueye, although both commonly carry super effective coverage for Rotom-C. These two item options also let Rotom-C more effectively bluff a Choice Scarf set, potentially letting it scare out faster threats like Starmie and Talonflame. Choice Specs sets are fairly potent wallbreakers that make Volt Switch slightly more punishing to switch into and can just get by with Rotom-C's limited coverage. However, they are much less effective at ensuring Rotom-C can generate constant momentum with Volt Switch. Nasty Plot sets can use Substitute + Discharge to exploit foes like Vaporeon that can't break Substitute and cripple checks like Goodra, but Volt Switch pivoting is too good to drop.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Dragalge, Guzzlord, and Goodra can withstand Rotom-C's boosted attacks, take negligible damage from Volt Switch, and have ways to punish whatever Rotom-C brings in with Volt Switch, be it Dragalge's Flip Turn, Guzzlord's Knock Off, or one of Goodra's coverage attacks.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types like Decidueye and Vileplume have solid special bulk and typing, letting them easily wall Rotom-C.

Strong resisted special STAB moves from the likes of Dragalge, Exploud, and Choice Specs Sylveon also potentially 2HKO Doublade.

However, Lycanroc won't sweep so long as there are physically bulky Pokemon and Ground-types left that can tank its hits, like Mudsdale, Silvally-Ground, and Doublade. Lycanroc's general frailty also makes safely getting it in difficult, as well as its reliance on Gigalith for activating Sand Rush.

    "overview": "<p>Silvally-Ghost is an incredibly potent wallbreaker and late-game cleaner in NU as a result of its strong Multi-Attack and ability to boost with both Swords Dance and Flame Charge. Ghost-type Multi-Attack is very hard to safely switch into, so many teams are forced to rely on blanket physical walls like Mudsdale and Guzzlord that are more vulnerable to being overwhelmed throughout the game. What holds Silvally-Ghost back, though, is its poor coverage. When faced with a foe such as Braviary that Multi-Attack won't do the job against, Silvally-Ghost typically struggles to break past it due to weak coverage moves limited to essentially Bug and Rock, and its unimpressive unboosted Attack stat amplifies this issue. Additionally, Silvally-Ghost is fairly easy to revenge kill if it doesn't get a Speed boost, which can make setting up ideal late-game sweeping scenarios somewhat difficult. It also suffers from being unable to hold a more useful item, which lessens its ability to wallbreak, and being a poor Knock Off absorber due to its Dark weakness.</p> ",

    "overview": "<p>Copperajah's blend of offense and defense makes it a potent wallbreaker that also offers teams an awful lot defensively. Teams typically will struggle to fit a reliable defensive switch-in to Copperajah because of its great coverage, which limits otherwise reasonable checks like Guzzlord and Mudsdale to being situational switch-ins. Copperajah is also a fine Stealth Rock setter because it retains a significant offensive presence even with minimal investment, giving it plenty of chances to force foes out and set its entry hazard. Copperajah's biggest flaw, however, is how poor its longevity is. It is heavily reliant on Wish support to stay healthy and is prone to getting repeatedly weakened by pivoting moves from foes like Rotom-C, Heliolisk, Dragalge, and Ninjask, forcing it to cede momentum. It's also incredibly slow, which greatly expands the list of foes that will threaten Copperajah and force it out.</p> ",

Play Rough immediately removes Guzzlord and prevents Scrafty from setting up against Copperajah, but it's otherwise very limited in use.
