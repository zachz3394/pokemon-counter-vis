        "description": "<p>With Chlorophyll doubling its Speed under the sun and making it faster than every unboosted Pokemon in the NatDex metagame, Venusaur is a staple on dedicated sun teams. Thanks to Growth giving a +2 boost under the sun, it allows Venusaur to quickly power up and threaten opposing teams. However, Venusaur struggles to hit everything it wants due to needing both Sludge Bomb for Unaware Clefable and Mega Latios and Weather Ball for Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor. Furthermore, its lack of immediate power, middling bulk, and reliance on the sun make it an inconsistent and one dimensional sweeper. Giga Drain is Venusaur's main STAB option thanks to the recovery letting Venusaur stay healthy in spite of Life Orb chip damage and other hits while also allowing it to beat Chansey and Blissey more comfortably. Earth Power hits one of the biggest threats to sun in Heatran, as well as Galarian Slowking, which otherwise walls Venusaur. Weather Ball is the primary option due to it allowing Venusaur to blast through Steel-types such as Corviknight, Mega Scizor, and Ferrothorn, which otherwise wall it. Sludge Bomb can also be run, as it provides a much stronger STAB option that allows Venusaur to break through Mega Latios and Unaware Clefable, but it is generally an inferior option due to it rendering Venusaur unable to break past certain Steel-types. Poisonium Z can also be used in place of Life Orb to allow Venusaur to break past Mega Latias, which its sun teammates like Blaziken and Victini really appreciate, but this sacrifices the overall power it gets from Life Orb. A Modest nature is used because the extra power is needed to secure crucial KOes on Pokemon like Mega Latios, as well as consistently beating Chansey and Blissey, and the Speed increase from a Timid Nature is generally unneeded and is only useful for Choice Scarf Greninja.</p> <p>Venusaur only fits on dedicated sun teams due to its reliance on sun to function effectively. Thus, Torkoal is a needed partner alongside Venusaur, as it's able to set sun and provide Stealth Rock to help Venusaur clean better. Furthermore, Torkoal also checks the Steel-types that non-Weather Ball Venusaur is unable to break through. Fire- resistant Pokemon like Hydreigon and Mega Garchomp are also great partners alongside Venusaur due to them checking the likes of Heatran and Volcarona, which are often an issue for sun teams as a whole, and they appreciate Venusaur eliminating Unaware Clefable for them. Pokemon such as Victini, Heatran, and Blaziken are stellar partners for Venusaur, as they can punch holes in the opposing team for Venusaur to clean late game. Lastly, naturally fast Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Tapu Lele and Landorus-T make up for Venusaur's low Speed stat outside of sun, and can also clean weakened teams.</p> "

Defog is an option, as Mega Charizard Y has a good matchup against common entry hazard setters like Ferrothorn and Heatran, but its extreme vulnerability to Stealth Rock along with it losing to hazard setters like Garchomp makes it an unreliable Defogger. It also dislikes giving up an important moveslot for it.</p> <h1>Mega Charizard X</h1> <p>On more offensive teams that do not require Mega Charizard X's longevity and defensive utility, you can remove Roost and use both Dragon Claw and Earthquake.</p> </section><h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <section><h1>Mega Charizard Y</h1> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Stealth Rock halves Mega Charizard Y's health, severely limiting its ability to switch in and wallbreak. To add insult to injury, some Stealth Rock setters can even set the hazard up in front of it.</p> <p><strong>Blissey and Chansey</strong>: Blissey and Chansey are near impossible for Mega Charizard Y to break through due to their massive special bulk, and they can then proceed to either status it or pivot out to a dangerous teammate.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types</strong>: Dragon-types like Mega Latios, Mega Latias, Hydreigon, and Garchomp are tough for Mega Charizard Y to deal with due to their resistance to Fire and Grass. The former two are particularly difficult to deal with due to their good bulk and access to recovery.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Tyranitar and Mega Tyranitar are huge threats to Mega Charizard Y, as they can switch in and override sun with sand to weaken its STAB move and force Solar Beam to charge, and they then proceed to either KO it with their Rock-type moves or damage it as it tries to switch out with Pursuit. However, they must watch out for Scorching Sands burns and the rare Focus Blast. Pelipper is similarly dangerous, as it can switch in on Mega Charizard Y, override sun with rain, and proceed to either KO it with its Water-type moves or pivot out to a dangerous teammate.</p> <p><strong>Toxapex: Toxapex resists Fire while not being weak to Solar Beam, letting it check Mega Charizard Y well although Scorching Sands and Future Sight support threaten it to a degree.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon like Tapu Koko, Mega Lopunny, and Garchomp can revenge kill Mega Charizard Y; however, they, with the exception of Garchomp, cannot switch in on it at all.</p> <h1>Mega Charizard X</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Physically bulky Water-types like Slowbro, Toxapex, and Tapu Fini can take Mega Charizard X's STAB moves with ease and pressure it with their own STAB moves, but they must watch out for the rare Thunder Punch and, in Toxapex's case, Earthquake. Toxapex can also be 2HKOed by +1 Dragon Claw into Earthquake, while Tapu Fini is 2HKOed by +1 Flare Blitz after some chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Landorus-T can weaken Mega Charizard X with Intimidate and threaten it with Earthquake, forcing it to switch. Hippowdon can switch in and force Mega Charizard X out with Earthquake or phaze it, removing its boosts. However, offensive variants of Landorus-T can be OHKOed by Flare Blitz after Stealth Rock, while defensive variants can be easily worn down due to their lack of recovery. Gliscor can also tank one boosted Flare Blitz if it is at full health and KO back with Earthquake in combination with recoil damage.</p> <p><strong>Rock-types: Tyranitar and Mega Diancie can switch in and KO Mega Charizard X with their Rock-type STAB moves, but they have to be careful about Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Stealth Rock: Charizard's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock prior to Mega Evolving makes it difficult to switch in, and, after Mega Evolving, it gets crippled by all entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Entry hazard damage and Toxic from the likes of Toxapex and Heatran reduce Mega Charizard X's longevity, making it more susceptible to being revenge killed. Landorus-T's Rocky Helmet, Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs, Garchomp's Rough Skin, and Flare Blitz do the same. However, these Pokemon cannot switch in on Mega Charizard X's attacks, with the exception of Garchomp if is not running Dragon Claw.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Ash-Greninja's Water Shuriken, Mega Lopunny's and Mega Medicham's Fake Outs, and Choice Scarf users like Tapu Lele and Landorus-T can revenge kill Mega Charizard X if it gets chipped enough, but they cannot come in safely against its attacks and are outsped after a Dragon Dance.</p> </section>",

        "description": "<p>Mega Charizard Y is a ferocious wallbreaker in National Dex because of its sky high Special Attack stat, great ability in Drought, and passable Speed tier that lets it threaten much of the metagame. Drought sets Mega Charizard Y apart by boosting its Fire-type moves, weakening Water-type moves, ands also letting it use Solar Beam effectively, which makes it a Fire-type that is able to threaten out bulky Water-types such as Tapu Fini and Slowking. Mega Charizard Y's typing and access to Roost let it check Pokemon like Rillaboom and Mega Scizor reliably throughout a game . Flamethrower has perfect accuracy and high PP, but Fire Blast has explosive power, easily OHKOing Landorus-T and possibly Zapdos as well as 2HKOing offensive Garchomp. Solar Beam complements Mega Charizard Y's STAB move well, severely denting bulky Water-types like Tapu Fini and Slowbro that may try to switch in on Flamethrower or Fire Blast. Scorching Sands rounds off its coverage by OHKOing offensive Heatran while also 2HKOing physically defensive Toxapex after Stealth Rock, and its burn chance can ruin Tyranitar. Focus Blast is an option to replace Scorching Sands, notably hitting Tyranitar extremely hard while retaining the ability to smack Heatran. However, it has terrible accuracy and it also leaves Mega Charizard Y completely helpless against Toxapex without Future Sight support, so it is generally not advised. Roost lets Mega Charizard Y heal off residual damage and check Pokemon like Rillaboom throughout the game. A Timid nature is chosen to outspeed Pokemon like non-Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Hydreigon, and Tapu Lele.</p> <p>Mega Charizard Y absolutely hates Stealth Rock, as its health is halved by it, so good Defoggers like Corviknight, Zapdos, and Synthesis Kartana are absolutely mandatory partners for it. Blissey and Chansey are also huge thorns in Mega Charizard Y's side, as it cannot 2HKO them due to their massive special bulk, so Pokemon like Swords Dance Gliscor and Kartana that can take advantage of them are good partners. Heatran is also a good choice to trap and remove them. Pursuit trappers like Tyranitar, Weavile, and Aegislash can greatly pressure Mega Latias, which can potentially use Mega Charizard Y as setup fodder, and also force damage onto Blissey. Mega Charizard Y struggles with Toxapex, especially if running Focus Blast, so Slowbro and Slowking can pressure it with Future Sight and Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Heatran can beat it directly. Due to Mega Charizard Y's only passable Speed tier, it is prone to getting revenge killed by faster threats like Tapu Koko and Mega Lopunny, so pivots like the aforementioned Slowbro and Blissey can both switch in on these Pokemon and give it free switches via slow pivoting. Similarly, faster pivots like Tapu Koko can lure in bulky Grass-types like Ferrothorn that give Mega Charizard Y free turns while also helping wear down their shared checks, like Blissey. Due to how prolific Mega Charizard Y is as a wallbreaker, late-game cleaners Kartana make good partners for it, as it can break through their checks like Corviknight and Ferrothorn. Entry hazard support from the likes of Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Garchomp helps force damage onto Mega Charizard Y's checks, mainly Toxapex, as it can 2HKO it with Scorching Sands after Stealth Rock.</p> "

Its typing lets it switch in on and force out common Steel- and Grass-types such as Corviknight, Mega Scizor, Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, and Rillaboom, granting it setup opportunities. Flare Blitz deals serious damage to common Ground-types such as Gliscor and Landorus-T. Dragon Claw is preferable in the second moveslot to not be walled by other Dragon-types such as Garchomp and Mega Latias. However, this leaves it walled by Heatran and more easily checked by Mega Diancie and Tyranitar. Earthquake provides a way to hit Toxapex, and Steel-types weak to it such as Excadrill and Magnezone without taking recoil from Flare Blitz, while also OHKOing Heatran and Mega Diancie after a Dragon Dance and 2HKOing Mega Tyranitar after Stealth Rock. Thunder Punch could be used to hit bulky Water-types such as Slowbro, Tapu Fini, and Pelipper more effectively, but it gives worse neutral coverage. Roost recovers HP lost from Flare Blitz recoil and residual damage, letting Mega Charizard X check Grass-types like Rillaboom more easily. A Jolly nature is better to outspeed Pokemon below base 100 Speed like Landorus-T, Tapu Lele, Hydreigon and Kyurem.</p> <p>Mega Charizard X functions as a early- or mid-game wallbreaker that can take advantage of Steel- and Grass-types such as Corviknight, Mega Scizor, Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Ferrothorn, which benefits Pokemon like Rillaboom, Tapu Lele, Kartana, and Tapu Koko. In return, they can pressure some of its checks like Slowbro, Tapu Fini, Toxapex, Tyranitar, and Mega Diancie. Due to Charizard's 4x weakness to Stealth Rock prior to Mega Evolving, entry hazard removers such as Zapdos, Corviknight, and Tapu Fini are mandatory partners. Tapu Fini can also protect Mega Charizard X from status through Misty Terrain, giving it more opportunities to setup Dragon Dance. Stealth Rock setters like Garchomp, Clefable, and Gliscor chip some of boosted Mega Charizard X's answers; offensive Landorus-T turns from a decent check to a likely OHKO, Toxapex becomes a likely 2HKO, and Tapu Fini becomes a guaranteed 2HKO. Garchomp can also break through Landorus-T and Gliscor with its Z-Move to help Mega Charizard X sweep. Due to its Ground weakness after Mega Evolving, checks to Ground-types like Rillaboom, Tangrowth, and Corviknight make good teammates, with the latter also providing Defog support and Rillaboom pressuring common checks like Tapu Fini, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Slowbro. It's important to note that Rillaboom's and Tapu Fini's terrains make Earthquake and Dragon Claw too weak to use, respectively.</p> "

However, it is a very niche pick due to its extreme frailty, which leaves it helpless against Choice Scarf users, priority, and faster Pokemon once its Focus Sash is broken. Its frailty also means it cannot switch in at all without taking a large amount of damage. Psychic can overwhelm Pokemon that Psyshock cannot, such as Clefable, Landorus-T, and Garchomp; however, Psyshock can be used over it to more consistently deal with Blissey and Chansey. Focus Blast allows Alakazam to blow past Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, Corviknight, and especially Tyranitar and Mega Tyranitar, which can otherwise wall it and Pursuit trap it. Shadow Ball hits Pokemon that resist the other two moves, most notably Tapu Lele, Aegislash, and Mega Latias. Focus Sash lets Alakazam more easily set up and revenge kill faster Pokemon or priority users, which would otherwise KO Alakazam due to its frailty, and it cannot be broken by entry hazards or weather chip damage due to Magic Guard. However, Life Orb can be used over Focus Sash to more easily overwhelm Pokemon such as Clefable, Corviknight, and Mega Scizor; however, this set is very susceptible to being revenge killed.</p> <p>Alakazam fits primarily on bulky offense teams, as its high Speed and great Special Attack allow it to sweep late-game for those teams. Mega Tyranitar is a great partner for Alakazam, as it can Pursuit trap Slowking, Aegislash, and Mega Latias, which can all break Alakazam's Focus Sash, leaving it unable to revenge kill Pokemon like Rillaboom. Ferrothorn's Spikes is very beneficial to Alakazam, as it can make Alakazam harder to pivot around and wear down Pokemon that it can struggle with, such as Ash-Greninja, Rillaboom, and Weavile. Tapu Lele is also a good partner for Alakazam, as its Psychic Terrain boosts Alakazam's STAB move to dangerous levels, allowing it to beat Pokemon such as Clefable and Gliscor after a Nasty Plot.Psychic Terrain also prevents Alakazam from being revenge killed by priority from the likes of Mega Mawile and Aegislash.</p> "

The combination of Future Sight and Teleport reliably sets up teammates like Ash-Greninja and Mega Lopunny to break through troublesome defensive walls such as Toxapex, Tangrowth, and Clefable. Its good physical bulk allows it to check many key physical attackers such as Mega Medicham, Landorus-T, and Mega Lopunny. Scald lets Slowbro threaten the likes of Corviknight and Excadrill with a burn. Ice Beam is another option that lets Slowbro threaten Ground-types such as Gliscor, Garchomp, and Landorus-T better, but causes it to struggle to check other physical attackers. Heavy-Duty Boots lets Slowbro ignore damage from entry hazards, which is key in keeping it healthy throughout longer games. It can also run Rocky Helmet to punish physical attackers like Mega Medicham, Urshifu-R, and Mega Lopunny, but this makes its longevity much worse. A Relaxed nature with 0 Speed EVs ensures the slowest possible Teleport, guaranteeing a speed tie in Teleport mirrors against opposing Slowbro and Slowking.</p> <p>Slowbro tends to fit on bulky offense builds, where it can be paired with other Pokemon with pivoting moves, such as Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, and Corviknight. Fast and frail wallbreakers such as Tapu Koko, Ash-Greninja, Weavile, and Kartana appreciate Slowbro pivoting them onto the field safely and providing Future Sight support, which lets them more easily KO their checks like Landorus-T, Toxapex, Corviknight, and Tangrowth. Due to Slowbro's weakness to Electric-types such as Magnezone and Tapu Koko, pairing it up with Ground- and Grass-types that can switch into these Pokemon such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Tangrowth makes for a solid defensive backbone. Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Assault Vest Tangrowth deserve a special mention, as they are able to check Ash-Greninja, which Slowbro tends to let in for free. Pokemon that resist Dark such as Clefable and Kommo-o make for good teammates, as they're able to switch into Dark-type moves from the likes of Tyranitar, Greninja, and Hydreigon, which threaten Slowbro. Lastly, Blissey forms a stellar defensive core alongside Slowbro, as its ability to switch into special attacks directed at Slowbro, alongside its access to Teleport, lets these two cover most offensive Pokemon while keeping up momentum.</p> "

If your team already has a Z-Move user, Sitrus Berry is an option that can give Azumarill a bit more health after setting up in a best-case scenario, but such scenarios are quite rare, and the loss of health from Belly Drum makes it much harder for Azumarill to find opportunities to set up while also preventing it from effectively checking Weavile and Ash-Greninja. Knock Off is the preferred last move in order to OHKO Toxapex and Ferrothorn after Stealth Rock damage. This set works best on hyper offense and rain teams, as Azumarill can theoretically work as an early-game wallbreaker on hyper offense, while rain significantly boosts the power of Aqua Jet and gives it more favorable rolls against threats like Zapdos and Garchomp, which can make it easier for Azumarill to sweep via giving Aqua Jet. However, both playstyles have far better options available to them; hyper offense can utilize numerous other, more consistent sweepers, such as Kommo-o, Rillaboom, and Volcarona, while Mega Swampert, Ash-Greninja, and Manaphy are all far superior rain sweepers.</p> "

However, it is a specially bulky Water-type that cannot handle Ash-Greninja at all, and it's completely outclassed by Slowbro and Galarian Slowking in the Future Sight department. Its low Defense and Dark weakness leave it vulnerable to physical attackers like Mega Lopunny, Garchomp, and Pursuit users like Weavile and Tyranitar, even though all of these fear Scald. Thus, Slowking struggles to fit on teams, and it's almost entirely outclassed by other Water-types such as Slowbro, Toxapex, and Tapu Fini. Future Sight prevents Pokemon such as Toxapex, Clefable, and Kommo-o from switching in safely on Slowking's teammates like Mega Charizard Y and Mega Lopunny until it lands, often leading to checkmate situations. Teleport grants free switches in for Slowking's frail teammates like Weavile and Mega Medicham. Slack Off and Regenerator make it a good long-term check to threats like Heatran and Tapu Lele. Heavy-Duty Boots cancels entry hazard damage, letting it pivot more easily.

It being a Water-type that cannot check Ash-Greninja makes Pokemon such as Tapu Bulu, Kommo-o, and Amoonguss mandatory partners.

Pokemon such as Clefable, Mega Lopunny, and Ferrothorn appreciate Slowking checking Tapu Lele and Heatran. Amoonguss, Gliscor, and Ferrothorn can handle Electric-types for Slowking. Finally, Slowking is easily overwhelmed by physical attackers like Mega Lopunny, Mega Mawile, and Garchomp due to its mediocre physical bulk, but teammates like Corviknight and Landorus-T can handle these threats well.</p> "

Also, its good Special Attack and great movepool make Galarian Slowking a hard Pokemon to pivot around. Thanks to Assault Vest, good natural bulk, Regenerator, and good defensive typing, it can easily tank special attacks such as Kyurem's Ice Beam and Ash-Greninja's Hydro Pump, letting it use Future Sight to provide advantageous situations for its teammates or punish its switch-ins. While Knock Off doesn't completely ruin Galarian Slowking, losing its item does notably compromise its bulk, preventing it from pivoting into threats like Ash-Greninja and Kyurem. Furthermore, Galarian Slowking's crippling weakness to Pursuit can discourage it from entering the field, since Weavile and Mega Tyranitar can trap and KO it. Finally, Galarian Slowking faces competition from Slowking as a special wall due to its better immediate recovery, access to Teleport, and ability to check threats well without Assault Vest. Flamethrower punishes Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Corviknight that try to pivot in Galarian Slowking's STAB attacks. Scald is used over Hydro Pump due to its burn chance discouraging switch-ins from Pursuit trappers, like Weavile and Mega Tyranitar, and Ground-types such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Gliscor without its Toxic Orb activated. It also wins the one-on-one Heatran matchup. 252 HP and 140 SpD EVs along with a Calm Nature allow Galarian Slowking to avoid a 2HKO from Choice Specs Greninja's Dark Pulse, and the remaining EVs are placed into Special Attack to improve its ability to punish switch-ins.</p> <p>Galarian Slowking fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate Future Sight support and need a sturdy check to strong special attackers and Fairy-types. Dragon-types like Garchomp, Kommo-o, and Hydreigon appreciate Galarian Slowking forcing out Fairy-type Pokemon such as Tapu Fini, Tapu Koko, and Clefable. Tangrowth likes Galarian Slowking's ability to check Tapu Koko, Kyurem, and Tapu Lele. In return, Tangrowth checks Ground-types like Garchomp and other physical attackers such as Kartana, Mega Swampert, and Mega Tyranitar for it, as well as forming a great Regenerator core. Urshifu-R, Mega Lopunny, Weavile, Mega Charizard Y, and Ash-Greninja appreciate the Future Sight support to prevent Toxapex, Clefable, and Kommo-o from safely switching into them. Due to Galarian Slowking's weakness to Pursuit, Knock Off, and Dark-types such as Weavile and Tyranitar generally, offensive Dark-type checks like Mega Lopunny and defensive checks like Tangrowth and Ferrothorn work well with it. Dark-resistant Pokemon like Tyranitar and Clefable help Galarian Slowking check Ash-Greninja more easily. Ground-types like Gliscor and Landorus-T also tend to force Galarian Slowking out, making Corviknight, Synthesis Kartana, Tapu Bulu, and Rillaboom good partners. Rillaboom and Tapu Bulu are especially good, as they both provide Grassy Terrain support, decreasing Earthquake damage and giving it a form of passive recovery.</p> "

Curse can be considered over Swords Dance to beat Swords Dance Rillaboom and Gliscor due to the Defense raise, but not setting up twice can leave Mega Scizor fairly passive.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types and Fire-type coverage: Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, Moltres, and Heatran do well in switching into Mega Scizor and threatening it out. The latter three hate having their Heavy-Duty Boots or Leftovers removed by Knock Off, though, as it can make switching in much harder when Stealth Rock is up. Other Pokemon with Fire-type coverage like Mega Diancie, Mega Latias, and Clefable also make it hard for Mega Scizor to switch into them.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-type Pokemon: Toxapex, Pelipper, Rotom-W, and Slowbro can pivot into Mega Scizor, forcing it out with a burn or Haze, although +2 Mega Scizor can 2HKO them all.

Burn, in particular, can make it hard for Mega Scizor to threaten the foes it has to check and can give Clefable, Mega Latias, and Reuniclus an opportunity to set up.</p> <p><strong>Faster Bullet Punch Answers</strong>: Due to Mega Scizor's dependence on Bullet Punch to beat faster foes, faster Pokemon that resist and survive a +2 Bullet Punch, such as Ash-Greninja and Victini, are able to revenge kill it.

Bullet Punch makes up for Mega Scizor's crippling Speed stat, and it also serves as a great STAB move to revenge kill Kyurem, Mega Diancie, Calm Mind Clefable, and Gengar. U-turn can be used to make Mega Scizor a defensive pivot while also hitting Mega Latias, Slowbro, and Tangrowth.

However, it is overly reliant on Bullet Punch to hit fast threats due to its mediocre Speed, is very vulnerable to Fire-type moves, and easily loses its bulk through chip damage. Bullet Punch is Mega Scizor's main STAB  attack and powerful Technician-boosted priority to challenge revenge kilers such as Weavile, Tapu Koko, and Garchomp. Superpower allows Mega Scizor to hit Steel-type Pokemon that otherwise wall it such as Magnezone, Ferrothorn, and Heatran. Sand Tomb allows Mega Scizor to trap and remove the likes of Heatran, Toxapex, and Magnezone for its partners such as Volcarona and Serperior to clean late-game.

Spikes helps wear down the opposing team and makes it easier for Skarmory’s teammates to sweep. Rocky Helmet is used to get off damage against physical attackers like Mega Lopunny, Mega Mawile, Rillaboom, and Mega Swampert.

Clefable can check dangerous setup sweepers that threaten Skarmory like Mega Heracross and Mega Latias thanks to Unaware. Mega Sableye is great to pair with Skarmory due to Magic Bounce preventing Stealth Rock from wearing it down and Will-O-Wisp making physical attackers like Garchomp, Mega Scizor, and Kartana easier to handle. Alomomola can provide Wish support while also coming in on attacks from Mega Scizor, Mega Charizard X, and Victini that Skarmory struggles with, while in return Skarmory can come in on strong attacks from Rillaboom and Garchomp for it. Gastrodon is great to have a Manaphy check for the team, and it can also take care of Heatran, Magnezone, Manaphy, and Tapu Koko for Skarmory. Both Calm Mind Clefable and Reuniclus on balance teams love Skarmory for its Spikes support, which makes it easier for these two to set up and sweep.

        "description": "<p>Blissey's enormous special bulk allows it to effectively take on most of the tier's many special attackers, with threats such as Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Mega Charizard Y all failing to break Blissey. Teleport allows it to safely pivot in teammates like Ash-Greninja, Mega Medicham, and Mega Mawile and take advantage of the many switches that it forces; Blissey's ability to viably hold Heavy-Duty Boots also makes it hard to wear down via entry hazards, unlike its pre-evolution Chansey. Toxic allows Blissey to chip away at threats such as Mega Latias, Slowbro, Landorus-T, and Zapdos. Targeting Mega Latias is especially important, as Blissey is one of the few Pokemon that can reliably come in on it and cripple it in the long term with Toxic. It must be noted, however, that Toxic forces Blissey to use Teleport more often, as it invites Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Corviknight, Aegislash, and Kartana to easily pivot in. Thunder Wave is another good choice for the last move, as it allows Blissey to effectively cripple offensive Pokemon like Mega Mawile and Kartana. It also gives Blissey a weapon against a couple of the select few special attackers that otherwise handily beat Blissey, such as Alakazam, Reuniclus, a reckless Gengar on the switch, and Calm Mind Clefable. Stealth Rock can be run over a status move if your team can't fit a Stealth Rock setter elsewhere, but Blissey is even more passive than normal without Toxic or Thunder Wave and can easily be taken advantage of by threats such as Mega Latias, Corviknight, and Aegislash.</p> <p>Blissey finds its home on balanced and bulky offensive teams. There it should be used to pivot into threats such as Heatran and Ash-Greninja and regain momentum with Teleport while also spreading status. Blissey really hates powerful physical attackers like Garchomp, Mega Lopunny, and Mega Medicham. A physically bulky partner is therefore appreciated. Slowbro and its Mega Evolution are very solid switch-ins to Fighting-type attacks, are capable of checking many of the tier's physical attackers, and can also form a very strong double Teleport core with Blissey. Corviknight effectively rounds out the Slowbro + Blissey core, taking on the likes of Kartana, Mega Scizor, Rillaboom, Weavile, and Mega Tyranitar, as well as offering Defog support and additional pivoting support with U-turn. Zapdos is another option that meets the previously mentioned positives bar checking Weavile and Mega Tyranitar, and it can also provide pivoting support with Volt Switch if desired. Toxapex can also handle Mega Lopunny and can beat other powerful physical attackers that Blissey dislikes like Mega Scizor and Mega Mawile. Blissey's Teleport makes it a very solid pivot, which is appreciated by Pokemon like Mega Medicham, Greninja, and Weavile. The latter two are also capable of revenge killing Gengar, a special attacker that completely shuts down Blissey, with Weavile in particular heavily limiting additional threats such as Mega Medicham with Pursuit. Physical walls, such as Landorus-T and Toxapex, appreciate Blissey taking on special attackers they can't handle, such as Ash-Greninja, Heatran, and Tapu Koko. Thunder Wave variants of Blissey can also be paired with slower wallbreakers that appreciate the paralysis support, such as Mega Mawile, Garchomp, Mega Medicham, Mega Charizard Y, and Mega Heracross. Toxic variants of Blissey dislike Steel-types, with Landorus-T, Victini, and Garchomp helping out in that category.</p> "

However, Tyranitar‘s middling Speed stat and poor defensive typing mean it struggles to come in and dish out multiple hits throughout the match. Stone Edge is Tyranitar’s main STAB move, being extremely hard to switch into due to its sheer power. Crunch is Tyranitar’s most spammable move due to the tiers‘s lack of sturdy Dark-resistant Pokemon, and it also KOes Pokemon like Mega Latias and Slowbro that can live a Stone Edge comfortably and retaliate. Pursuit lets Tyranitar trap Ghost- and Psychic-types that it forces out, such as Aegislash and Mega Latias. It can also trap Choice-locked Ash-Greninja, Tapu Lele, Chansey, and Zapdos, which otherwise can‘t threaten it back. Superpower lets Tyranitar immediately threaten a KO on Chansey, which can otherwise use Soft-boiled to scout its move, and also hits Ferrothorn and Heatran hard. Fire Punch OHKOes Mega Scizor and Ferrothorn without risking a Stone Edge miss or getting chipped multiple times by Iron Barbs. Earthquake lets Mega Tyranitar nail Heatran, Mega Mawile, and Magnezone without dropping its Attack and Defense, and it gives it near-perfect neutral coverage.

Skarmory and Mega Latias can deal with Ground-types such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Excadrill benefits greatly from Tyranitar providing sand and wearing down the bulky Grass- and Flying-types that normally check it, such as Tangrowth, Corviknight, and Landorus-T.

Breakneck Blitz gives Blaziken a strong neutral hit against all of its checks but is much weaker in general. Overall, Z-Move sets focus on targeting one specific Pokemon or group of Pokemon, and they can't break through Blaziken's other checks. A Choice Band set gives much greater immediate power but struggles due to how easy it is to scout and wear down.

This can cut into its longevity, as Pelipper can be exploited on the turns it is using Roost by strong special attackers such as Tapu Koko and Tapu Lele.</p> <p>The ability to summon rain with Drizzle is incredibly important, as it enables several powerful walbreakers such as Mega Swampert, Ash-Greninja, Manaphy, and Zapdos. Mega Swampert is a particularly potent teammate, as not only is it enabled by Pelipper's Drizzle, but it is also a great check to strong Electric-type attackers such as Tapu Koko, Magnezone, and Zeraora. Ferrothorn is also a great teammate, as it can switch into Tapu Lele, Tapu Koko, and Magearna, all of which threaten Pelipper out. Rain also weakens Fire-type attacks, which Ferrothorn greatly appreciates. Ferrothorn can also use this as an opportunity to set Spikes for its teammates.</p> "

However, Mega Gardevoir is thoroughly outclassed by Tapu Lele as a wallbreaker. Tapu Lele is much more useful in matchups outside of bulky teams while still maintaining the ability to tear down balance teams, has the ability to hold items to further increase its power, and boasts a stronger Psychic-type STAB attack under Psychic Terrain. Mega Gardevoir also is unable to outperform Clefable, Reuniclus, Tapu Fini, or Mega Latias as a Fairy- or Psychic-type Calm Mind sweeper, due to their respective individual advantages over it such as an immunity to damage from status, access to recovery options, or better bulk. There is generally no reason to use Mega Gardevoir over Tapu Lele or any of the aforementioned Pokemon at any time, as even the slight Speed tier increase isn’t worth it.</p> ",

Mystical Fire allows Mega Gardevoir to hit Steel-type Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Mega Scizor, and Corviknight, which otherwise wall it. Focus Blast can be used to let Mega Gardevoir hit Heatran, which otherwise walls it; however, this choice leaves Mega Gardevoir struggling to break past Corviknight and Mega Scizor. Taunt is used to cripple Chansey, Blissey and Slowking by preventing their recovery, letting it break past these Pokemon, as well as preventing it from being statused, which can cut into its longevity and its nifty Speed tier. Trace is the chosen pre-Mega Evolution ability in order to potentially give Gardevoir a free switch in against the likes of Heatran or Gastrodon. Healing Wish and Will-O-Wisp can also be used to utilize Mega Gardevoir’s vast supportive options; however, running these moves severely limits Mega Gardevoir’s wallbreaking capabilities, and as a result it is greatly outperformed by Pokemon such as Clefable and Mew due to their superior recovery options and longevity. Pokemon that appreciate Mega Gardevoir wallbreaking early-game, such as Rillaboom and Bisharp, serve as great teammates. Mega Gardevoir should never be used on any serious team as the few advantages it has over its other competitors don't even come close to outweighing the cons. Teammates such as Volcarona and Manaphy who appreciate Blissey, Toxapex, and Chansey being broken down work well with it.</p> "

Shedinja's teammates, specifically Mega Sableye, Mega Scizor, and Weavile, commonly carry Knock Off, which causes Poltergeist to fail. Shadow Claw doesn't need items to be intact and also has more PP than Poltergeist, but it is incredibly weak and makes contact, meaning Shedinja is vulnerable to Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin damage. Shadow Sneak can pick off a weakened Gengar, but it otherwise does little damage and also triggers contact damage.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Super Effective Coverage: Coverage moves from Pokemon Shedinja typically check can ruin it.

Skarmory, Melmetal, and Alomomola are teammates that can double switch into the aforementioned Pursuit trappers. Tyranitar in particular poses a huge threat, as Shedinja cannot come in while its summoned sand is active. Pokemon that absorb status such as burn and poison are vital, as these conditions will KO Shedinja. Chansey and Gliscor are exampes of solid status absorbers to pair with it. Gliscor is particularly helpful, as it can switch into the dangerous Heatran, which otherwise can switch into Shedinja freely. Gastrodon can help alleviate pressure from Heatran as well.</p> "

Will-O-Wisp burns physical attackers that may try to advantage of Mega Sableye, like Mega Mawile, Kartana, and Mega Garchomp, along with crippling Stealth Rock setters like Garchomp and Landorus-T, letting Mega Sableye keep Stealth Rock off the field.

This set forgoes a secondary coverage move in favor of utility moves that help Latias with some of its biggest issues and can even allow it to use status-reliant checks like Gastrodon, Heatran, and Ferrothorn as setup fodder. Substitute lets it dodge status conditions; however, it has to play more carefully around them, as it cannot directly switch into them. It also comes with the added benefit of allowing Latias to dodge critical hits and pesky secondary effects from foes like Greninja, Kyurem, and Tapu Lele while also allowing it to escape from Weavile and Tyranitar's Pursuit. Refresh allows Latias to shrug off status conditions from foes like Toxapex, Clefable, Heatran, and Landorus-T. This lets it stay healthy and not force it to Roost as much, making it more efficient at sweeping; it also makes it easier to set up on the aforementioned foes, as Latias doesn't have to worry about getting crippled by status. Reflect Type can be used to copy the type from foes like Heatran, Toxapex, and Ferrothorn, allowing it to ignore their status moves and resist their and other foes', like Mega Mawile, Ash-Greninja, and Hydreigon, attacks.</p> <p>Because Mega Latias needs time to set up in order to be threatening, and it is practically useless until it sets up, pairing it with other setup sweepers like Swords Dance Gliscor or Calm Mind Reuniclus help should Mega Latias fail to find a setup opportunity. Teammates such as Choice Band Weavile and Heatran that present an immediate offensive presence complement Latias nicely. Due to this set's complete inability to hurt Dark-types like Weavile, Mega Tyranitar, Hydreigon, and Ash-Greninja, pairing it with status spreaders like Heatran, Gliscor, and Toxic Spikes from Toxapex is near mandatory; furthermore, teammates that can deal with these Dark-types, like Tapu Fini, Buzzwole, and Clefable, make for stellar teammates. Since it needs to boost to function properly, Latias is completely walled by Haze Toxapex, and as such, teammates that can take advantage of it like Tapu Lele, Gliscor, and Whirlpool Tapu Fini make for good teammates.</p> "

Substitute can also be used over Ice Beam to bypass status, but this reduces its longevity and means it has fewer coverage options. Earthquake can be used over Aura Sphere to allow Mega Latios to always KO Heatran, although it forces Mega Latios to use a Naive nature and does not hit Mega Tyranitar as hard.

It also has great defensive utility that, thanks to its natural bulk and typing, lets it come in on threats like Kartana, Mega Charizard Y, and Heatran. However, despite its good coverage, Mega Latios struggles to fit all the moves it wants to have. Variants without Psychic struggle to break past Toxapex and Clefable cores, while ones with Psychic are walled by Slowking and Corviknight and can't consistently break through Tapu Fini. Furthermore, Mega Latios is susceptible to being Pursuit trapped by Weavile and Mega Tyranitar and struggles to break past the numerous Fairy- and Psychic-types that plague the tier, such as Mega Latias, Clefable, and Reuniclus. Psychic is Mega Latios’s main STAB option, letting it pressure foes like Toxapex and Clefable. Thunder can be used instead for its ability to 2HKO Slowking, Corviknight, and Tapu Fini while still maintaining the ability to hit Toxapex, although by forgoing Psychic, Mega Latios loses out on having a consistent STAB option against Clefable and Toxapex. Aura Sphere nails Steel- and Dark-types such as Heatran, Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, and Weavile. Ice Beam allows Mega Latios to be a consistent check to Grass- and Ground-types such as Rillaboom, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Serperior.</p> <p>Mega Latios fits on bulky offense teams that appreciate its offensive presence alongside its defensive utility.

Steel-types such as Melmetal, Ferrothorn, and Corviknight are amazing partners because they can switch into the Ice-, Dragon-, and Fairy-type moves. In return, Mega Latios can pivot into Fire-, Ground-, and Fighting-type attacks. Entry hazard support from Greninja, Ferrothorn, and Landorus-T are greatly appreciated by Mega Latios, as entry hazards chip its checks, such as Tyranitar and Toxapex, into OHKO range. Pursuit support from Weavile and Tyranitar helps Mega Latios by removing bulky Psychic-types such as Reuniclus and Mega Latias, allowing it to make progress more easily.

A specially defensive set with Iron Head / U-turn and two of Stealth Rock / Wish / Protect lets Jirachi act as a solid pivot that can provide Wish and Stealth Rock support while fulfilling an important defensive niche in checking Psychic- and Fairy-types.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Heatran, Mega Scizor, Aegislash, and Ferrothorn take very little damage from Jirachi’s Iron Head and U-turn. Mega Scizor, Firium Z Heatran, and Ghostium Z Aegislash are particularly dangerous, as they’re immune to Trick, while Ferrothorn can wear down Jirachi with Iron Barbs. However, specially defensive Heatran and Ferrothorn must be wary of Trick, as losing their Leftovers and being Choice-locked does them no favors.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Toxapex and Slowbro don’t mind Iron Head and don’t even need to risk a flinch while healing thanks to Regenerator. In the meantime, both can burn Jirachi, Toxapex can remove its Choice Scarf with Knock Off, and Slowbro can set up Future Sight or Teleport out. Jirachi is able to Trick them, though.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Volcarona, Heatran and Mega Charizard Y easily stomach all of Jirachi’s attacks and hit back with their powerful STAB moves.

Garchomp and Landorus-T need to be wary of Trick, however.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Most Electric-types easily switch into Jirachi thanks to their Steel resistance, and hit it hard with their STAB moves. Zapdos is especially troubling, as it has the potential to paralyze Jirachi with its ability, ruining its Speed. Magnezone can trap Jirachi locked into Iron Head and remove it with Thunderbolt.

In conjunction with Serene Grace, Iron Head can situationally defeat a wide range of additional threats as well, including Mega Medicham, Mega Lopunny, and Tapu Koko. As Jirachi’s damage output is mediocre outside of Iron Head, the remaining three moves are dedicated to utility in order to make the best out of Jirachi’s solid defensive typing. U-turn allows Jirachi to capitalize on switch-ins and preserve momentum while letting its offensive teammates in for free. Healing Wish lets Jirachi completely heal a weakened teammate at the cost of sacrificing itself, offering offensive partners a second chance to break open or clean up the opponent’s team. Trick can allow Jirachi to cripple nearly every switch-in to it, as Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Zapdos don’t like being locked into a move. Serene Grace gives Iron Head a 60% flinch chance, making it quite spammable against Pokemon that don’t resist Steel.</p> <p>Jirachi’s ability to fully heal a teammate is incredible for a number of offensive teammates, such as Mega Mawile, Garchomp, and Swords Dance Kartana. Its ability to cripple Pokemon like Toxapex, Heatran, and Slowbro with Trick and pivot out of them with U-turn is also fantastic for the aforementioned partners. Jirachi can act as a solid check to Fairy- and Psychic-types such as Clefable, Mega Diancie, and Tapu Lele, so Pokemon that may struggle with these threats like Mega Latias, Mega Medicham, and Mega Lopunny make good teammates. As Jirachi lacks the necessary longevity to continuously withstand these Fairy- and Psychic-types, additional soft checks such as Ferrothorn and Corviknight are advisable teammates. Jirachi cannot reliably revenge kill Pokemon like Kartana, Mega Scizor, and Ash-Greninja, so counterplay to these threats like bulky Landorus-T, Corviknight, and Blissey is essential. In addition, all of these Pokemon can form a pivoting core with Jirachi. Jirachi baits in Pokemon that aren’t bothered by its moves and can take advantage of it, like Heatran, Zapdos, and Mega Scizor. Jirachi’s best way of making progress against these Pokemon is either crippling them with Trick or pivoting out of them with U-turn into teammates that can exploit such as Garchomp, Greninja, and Tapu Koko.</p> "

Power-Up Punch allows Mega Lopunny to function as a potent cleaner in the late-game. Encore functions alongside Power-Up Punch to use passive Pokemon such as Clefable, Toxapex, and Skarmory as setup fodder by locking them into their recovery to boost its Attack stat with Power-Up Punch as these Pokemon are left unable to retaliate.

Swords Dance allows Garchomp to beat a lot of common Defoggers like Zapdos, Corviknight, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, allowing it to easily keep Stealth Rock up.

Alternatively, Dragonium Z with Outrage allows Garchomp to deliver a harder hit on physically defensive Pokemon like Landorus-T, Tangrowth, and Slowbro, and it can also catch a Mega Latias expecting a Stone Edge off guard. However, having a much worse matchup against Corviknight and Skarmory and the lack of a spammable STAB move once Devastating Drake has been used, make Dragonium Z an inferior option overall.

Garchomp is very easily forced out by faster offensive Pokemon such as Ash-Greninja, Weavile, Kartana, and Tapu Koko, so Pokemon that can deal with them, like Tapu Fini, Ferrothorn, Corviknight, and Gastrodon make for solid teammates.

Due to it beating many of the common Defoggers in the tier, Garchomp pairs well with Spikes users like Ash-Greninja and Ferrothorn, as it can threaten opposing Defoggers and keep Spikes on the field. It also has some very good defensive utility, being able to check Pokemon like Heatran, Zapdos, Volcarona, and Victini.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Due to its colossal Attack stat, good bulk, typing, and solid coverage Mega Garchomp has established itself as a dangerous wallbreaker. Swords Dance boosts Mega Garchomp’s already immensely high Attack stat to allow it to break through the likes of Landorus-T, Slowbro, and Gliscor. Scale Shot is not only a decent multi-hit Dragon-type attack, but the Speed boost it confers means Mega Garchomp outspeeds the likes of Greninja, Zeraora, and Mega Lopunny. Fire Fang breaks through defensive threats such as Corviknight, Tangrowth, and Skarmory, though Fire Blast takes better advantage of the latter two’s lackluster Special Defense stats. However, the latter is not boosted by Swords Dance, is unable to reliably break through the likes of Tapu Bulu and Corviknight, and forces Mega Garchomp to sacrifice its bulk by running a Naive nature. This leaves it vulnerable to specially offensive threats such as Ash-Greninja, Volcarona, and Heatran. An Adamant nature offers more power against the likes of Pyukumuku, Quagsire, and Rotom-W, but Mega Garchomp is then more easily revenge killed by faster threats like Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Excadrill.</p> <p>Mega Garchomp tends to fit best on offensive teams with teammates that clean up after it has broken holes through the opposing team such as Kartana, Hawlucha, and Weavile. Mega Garchomp's weakness to Ice-type attacks makes Water- and Steel-types such as Tapu Fini and Jirachi, respectively, good partners, although the former weakens Mega Garchomp's Scale Shot due to Misty Terrain. Mega Garchomp struggles in a similar fashion against opposing Fairy-types such as Clefable and Tapu Bulu who are able to pivot into Scale Shot and prevent it from boosting its Speed. Running partners that can deal with these threats, such as Bisharp and Gengar, makes for good synergy. Volcarona switches into Ice- and Fairy-type attacks directed towards Mega Garchomp, which creates opportunity for it to set up. In return, Mega Garchomp beats common Volcarona checks such as Toxapex, Blissey, and Heatran. It also fuctions amazingly in tandem with dual screens support from the likes of Serperior, Tapu Koko, and Grimmsnarl, giving it plenty of opportunity to set up.</p> "

Sand Force can also be run if your team dislikes the chip damage from sand, and it avoids powering up Mega Garchomp, but generally chipping down the opposing team is more worth it than not.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types Not Weak to Ground: The likes of Corviknight, Skarmory, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor freely come in on Hippowdon, as it's unable to meaningfully damage them. This allows them to remove its entry hazard, set up their own, or use non-Whirlwind variants as setup fodder.</p> <p><strong>Status: Toxic from the likes of Heatran, Zeraora, and Toxapex completely removes any longevity Hippowdon has, letting the likes of Heatran, Zeraora, and Magnezone overpower it.

It does, however, face severe competition as a Ground-type from Gliscor, Gastrodon, and Landorus-T, which bring more defensive utility and offensive presence, making Hippowdon difficult to justify despite its better raw bulk. It's also quite a subpar Stealth Rock setter, as it loses to the most common removal options in the tier, notably Tapu Fini and Corviknight. Toxic lets it limit its passivity, punishing switch-ins such as Tangrowth, Slowbro, and Zapdos. Whirlwind is just as good to phaze Pokemon such as Gliscor, Landorus-T, Calm Mind Clefable, and Mega Scizor that try to take advantage of it. Whirlwind also racks up chip damage on the opposing  team thanks to the Stealth Rock and sand Hippowdon provides. However, since both moves compete for one moveslot, Hippowdon will always be passive against a substantial number of Pokemon. Leftovers is the preferred item to help it check Tapu Koko and Magnezone.

The Attack investment lets Hippowdon's Earthquake always OHKO Excadrill.</p> <p>Pokemon that appreciate Hippowdon checking Electric-types, such as Corviknight, Skarmory, and Toxapex, make stellar defensive cores alongside it; in return, they can help cover its weakness to Grass- and Water-types such as Tangrowth, Rillaboom, Ash-Greninja, and Manaphy. Status severely cripples Hippowdon, as Toxic severely worsens its longevity, while burn makes it unable to threaten the likes of Toxapex and Galarian Slowking.

Corviknight, Mega Scizor, and Gliscor totally wall Hippowdon and remove its Stealth Rock or set up on it, so teammates that can handle these threats such as Heatran, Tapu Koko, Weavile, and Mega Latias are key to having Hippowdon function.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Due to the multi-hit nature of Triple Axel, it is very easy to rack up contact chip damage from Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs, Garchomp's Rough Skin, and various Rocky Helmet users. Icicle Crash avoids this chip damage while having a reliable damage output and a flinch chance; however, Icicle Crash does not always OHKO Mega Latias, so Triple Axel is preferred. An Adamant nature compounds an extra boost to Weavile's offense at the cost of its great Speed tier, notably not being able to outspeed Serperior, Mega Diancie, and Greninja. Life Orb is seen on hyper offense builds to boost Weavile's damage to truly devastating levels, notably being able to OHKO Corviknight with a boosted Triple Axel. However, entry hazard damage caused by the lack of Heavy-Duty Boots combined with Life Orb recoil greatly reduces Weavile's longevity. Since hyper offense playstyles focus on breaking down the opponent's team quickly, this lack of longevity is less noticeable for a comparatively huge damage boost. Alternatively, Wide Lens boosts the accuracy of Weavile's notoriously unreliable Triple Axel, but the greatly reduced longevity and lack of damage boost makes this option less ideal as well. While Low Kick helps to break past Ferrothorn and Melmetal, the loss of a valuable moveslot is often not worth it. Icium Z is an interesting option for a consistently powerful attack to break past certain targets like Ferrothorn and Corviknight while also bypassing the unreliability of Triple Axel; however, as with many of the other items, the lack of longevity makes it hard to fit. Darkinium Z also provides a high-power move that allows Weavile to potentially break through its checks, but this comes at the cost of the incredible utility of Knock Off. Groundium Z with Dig allows Weavile to bait in and KO Toxapex and Heatran, but the opportunity cost of dropping Ice Shard makes this hard to justify.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Due to Weavile's frailty, faster revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny and Tapu Koko can outspeed it and threaten an OHKO with their STAB moves. Additionally, strong priority moves such as Mega Medicham's Fake Out, Greninja's Water Shuriken, and Rillaboom's Grassy Glide will all deal heavy damage to Weavile and should be avoided at all times.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Mega Scizor, Mega Mawile, and Melmetal all take minimal damage from Weavile and threaten to OHKO it in return. Mega Scizor deserves special mention, as it is an extremely consistent counter due to its longevity through Roost.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Toxapex, Alomomola, and Tapu Fini, though they dislike the loss of their item, can switch into Weavile repeatedly over the course of the match and threaten it back with Scald burns or an OHKO after Stealth Rock in Tapu Fini's case. Toxapex and Alomomola can also remain healthy to continually check Weavile courtesy of Regenerator.</p> <p><strong>Contact-related Effects: Because Triple Axel makes contact three separate times, Weavile does not appreciate adverse contact effects like Rocky Helmet from Pokemon like Corviknight and Flame Body from Volcarona. The chip damage and status effects garnered up from these items and abilities make Weavile more susceptible to getting revenge killed and more easily dealt with defensively.</p> ",

Triple Axel threatens to OHKO common offensive Pokemon like Kartana, Mega Latias, and Mega Charizard Y. Knock Off helps Weavile cripple its defensive answers such as Toxapex, Alomomola, and Tapu Fini while hitting offensive Pokemon like Mega Medicham and Aegislash rather hard.

Pokemon that can pivot into these threats like Toxapex, Corviknight, and Clefable fit well alongside Weavile. Also, Weavile's susceptibility to Stealth Rock necessitates Defog support from the likes of Corviknight and Zapdos. Corviknight is especially noteworthy because it invites in Garchomp and offensive Landorus-T in order to pivot out with U-turn into Weavile. Additionally, Mega Scizor and Toxapex counter Weavile, so Pokemon that threaten them such as Taunt Heatran and Mega Medicham make for excellent partners.

Very few of its checks function in the long term; since Weavile uses Heavy-Duty Boots to ignore chip damage from entry hazards its often able to outlast its checks, and it only needs minimal chip damage to break through physical walls like Skarmory, Buzzwole, and Clefable. However, Weavile's lack of immediate power allows offensive threats such as Mega Mawile and Urshifu-R to switch in freely while additionally losing out on the ability to Pursuit trap susceptible foes. Triple Axel is the preferred Ice-type option due to its power, notably doing significantly more damage to Clefable and Corviknight, whereas Icicle Crash is more accurate, does not make contact, and has a handy flinch chance at the cost of a significant power drop. Knock Off is the Dark-type move of choice due to its excellent secondary effect of item removal, allowing Weavile to weaken foes like Heatran, Corviknight, and Tapu Fini, which helps with its ability to clean in the late game.

As such, Pokemon that can help safely pivot Weavile onto the field such as Landorus-T, Corviknight, and Mega Lopunny make for excellent teammates. Magnezone is an excellent pairing for Weavile due to its ability to trap Steel-types like Corviknight and Ferrothorn which Weavile might have trouble breaking through, as well as providing a strong Volt Switch which can potentially allow Weavile a free switch-in. Due to its potency as a late-game cleaner, Weavile appreciates being paired up with powerful wallbreakers like Kartana, Ash-Greninja, and Mega Mawile which can help it sweep after overwhelming shared checks like Corviknight, Tapu Fini, and Ferrothorn. Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Heatran which can provide support in the form of entry hazards make Weavile's job against Pokemon like Corviknight and Melmetal much easier. Furthermore, these Pokemon help to defensively check Pokemon that might try to revenge kill Weavile, such as Tapu Koko and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele.

A Relaxed nature is preferred, as Tangrowth uses both of its attacking stats and its Speed is already very low.</p> <p>Tangrowth fits on balance teams that need a very sturdy check to physical attackers such as Mega Lopunny, Kartana, and Rillaboom. Ground-types work well with Tangrowth, as they appreciate Tangrowth taking on Water- and Grass-types like Rillaboom, Kartana, and Mega Swampert. They are capable of blocking Volt Switch from the likes of Tapu Koko and Magnezone, as Tangrowth is not a suitable check to any of these on its own. Examples such as Garchomp and Gliscor work well to check the aforementioned while also switching into Heatran. These Ground-types can also can set Stealth Rock, which is important for Tangrowth, as it allows its team to better pressure dangerous Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y, Victini, and Heatran. Tangrowth's special bulk is meager, so having a very bulky specially defensive wall is recommended. Specially defensive Heatran pairs well with Tangrowth, as it can take on threats such as Zapdos, Life Orb Clefable, and Tapu Lele. Mega Tyranitar can also help Tangrowth out against Heatran, Reuniclus, and Mega Latias. Slowking can deal with threats such as Heatran and Tapu Lele. Tapu Fini also pairs well with Tangrowth due to it taking care of Ash-Greninja as well as Heatran, while Blissey can also act as a general sponge to Ash-Greninja, Kyurem, Tapu Koko, and Mega Charizard Y. These teammates appreciate Tangrowth taking care of dangerous physical attackers, such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, Mega Lopunny, and Rillaboom. Tangrowth needs good entry hazard removal on its side, as hazard damage can put it in range of some of the tier's stronger wallbreakers, such as Weavile and Swords Dance Mega Mawile. Zapdos, Tapu Fini, and Excadrill are all potentially good partners as a result. Additional checks to physical attackers Tangrowth can't deal with are also beneficial; Toxapex or Melmetal can take care of Weavile, while Corviknight can work with a revenge killer that can finish off Ground-types, such as Weavile or Ash-Greninja, to deal with Swords Dance variants of Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. Teammates like Swords Dance Garchomp and Mega Mawile appreciate Sleep Powder giving them a setup opportunity.</p> "

        "description": "<p>With an Assault Vest to improve its lackluster Special Defense and Regenerator, Tangrowth is a solid switch-in to threats such as Ash-Greninja, Tapu Koko, and Calm Mind Tapu Fini, absorbing their hits and forcing them out. However, Tangrowth is extremely susceptible to getting worn down by entry hazards and status and is generally passive. Physical attackers can overload it given its lack of Defense investment, and it's extremely reliant on its Assault Vest to handle special attackers, so taking Knock Off means it struggles to check anything. Tangrowth also faces major competition from the likes of Amoonguss, which boasts an additional Poison typing, can run a passive recovery item, and has additional utility in Clear Smog. However, Tangrowth still has a solid niche over it due to checking Ground-type threats such as Landorus-T and Garchomp, as well as having its own great support move in Knock Off. Giga Drain provides additional recovery and reliability, while Power Whip allows Tangrowth to consistently check Calm Mind Tapu Fini and pressure Mega Tyranitar more. Knock Off lets it consistently make progress on switch-ins such as Galarian Slowking, Blissey, and Heatran, vastly reducing their longevity and effectiveness. Sludge Bomb pressures opposing Grass-types, such as Rillaboom and Serperior, while also threatening to poison Pokemon such as Volcarona and Zapdos. Earthquake denies Heatran a free switch in, threatening a KO on offensive variants after Stealth Rock, while also solidly damaging Electric-types like Magnezone and Tapu Koko. Hidden Power Ice lets Tangrowth soft check Ground-types such as Garchomp, Landorus-T and Gliscor. Meanwhile, Hidden Power Fire lets it soft check Kartana, Ferrothorn, and Mega Scizor. The given EV spread allows Tangrowth to survive two Mega Swampert Ice Punches after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Tangrowth fits on bulky offense teams that appreciate its ability to check to Grass-, Water-, and Electric-types such as Serperior, Ash-Greninja, and Tapu Koko. Pokemon such as Tapu Fini, Gliscor, Garchomp, and Heatran are stellar teammates, greatly appreciating Tangrowth checking threats such as Ash-Greninja and Serperior, respectively. In return, they cover the Fire- and Ice-type moves from Pokemon like Weavile and Volcarona directed at it. Pokemon such as Tapu Koko and Tyranitar threaten Flying-type Pokemon such as Zapdos and Corviknight for it. Despite Tangrowth's Assault Vest, Ash-Greninja's Dark Pulses can still easily overwhelm it, so Dark-resistant teammates such as Clefable and Tapu Koko are solid partners. Solid entry hazard control from Pokemon such as Corviknight and Tapu Fini is a great asset given Tangrowth's frequent pivoting.</p> "

Knock Off can be used to threaten Slowbro, Reuniclus, and Slowking and cripple Pokemon that rely on their item, such as Volcarona, Zapdos, and Moltres. Ice Punch can be used to revenge kill Garchomp as well as nailing Gliscor, Mega Latias, and Landorus-T. It is important to note that upon Mega Evolving, Mega Gallade gains Inner Focus, protecting it from Landorus-T's Intimidate. Justified is the chosen ability prior to Mega Evolving to get an Attack boost by absorbing a weak Knock Off from Tangrowth or Toxapex.

Other teammates that appreciate Mega Gallade's ability to pressure Corviknight, Slowbro, and Heatran include Garchomp, Volcarona, and Serperior. Additionally, solid checks to Fairy-types are appreciated, such as Ferrothorn and Jirachi. Jirachi is an especially great teammate, as its Healing Wish gives Mega Gallade a second opportunity to sweep.

Defog is another option over Pain Split for role compression, as it also has a good matchup against two of the best Stealth Rock setters in the tier, Heatran and Landorus-T.

Will-O-Wisp is a neat option to immediately threaten physical attackers such as Garchomp and Tyranitar that switch in, as well as forcing dangerous mindgames with opposing Mega Mawile and Bisharp’s Sucker Punch. However, forgoing Toxic means Victini can't punish the likes of Mega Latias and Gastrodon, and Will-O-Wisp has much more niche uses compared to Toxic. Glaciate quickly disposes of the likes of Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor, although it is fairly terrible coverage otherwise, and Victini can beat the former two in the long term regardless due to their lack of recovery. Energy Ball and Scorching Sands are niche options to instantly punish would-be counters in Gastrodon and Heatran, although they're only useful for those two Pokemon and are not good choices compared to other coverage options.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Heatran: Heatran completely walls Victini and can recover any damage over time with its Leftovers. It is also immune to Toxic and can use Victini's Fire-type moves to boost its own damage with Flash Fire. However, Victini can lock Heatran into a status move with Encore and pivot out.

However, its mediocre offensive stats, reliance on Heavy-Duty Boots to be a consistent pivot, and lack of recovery mean it struggles to check threats in the long term. Victini is also extremely weak to Pursuit, so oftentimes it struggles to check Pokemon more than once. Blue Flare boasts a nifty burn chance to punish switch-ins such as Garchomp and Mega Swampert, and it can 2HKO defensive Landorus-T, which V-create can't. V-create is still viable, however, to break through specially bulky Pokemon such as Blissey and Galarian Slowking and check threats like Volcarona, although the Defense and Speed drops make Victini more vulnerable to Pursuit and revenge killers. Psychic pressures common Fire-resistant Pokemon such as Toxapex, Kommo-o, Garchomp, and Tapu Fini, as well as being a strong spammable STAB move. Future Sight is a support option that, in conjunction with U-turn, boosts teammates' wallbreaking capabilities but lowers Victini's immediate offensive presence. Bolt Strike hits bulky Water-types like Slowking and Tapu Fini much harder while still pressuring specially defensive Toxapex, although it means Victini can't pressure the likes of Garchomp and Kommo-o consistently. Toxic allows it to check the likes of Mega Latias, prevents Pokemon such as Volcarona from setting up on Blue Flare variants, and punishes switch-ins like Slowbro and Slowking. Encore discourages Clefable, Tapu Fini, and Mega Latias from trying to set up on it. This can make Pursuit trapping Mega Latias much easier due to Weavile and Tyranitar not needing to fear Aura Sphere. If running V-create or Bolt Strike, a Jolly or Hasty nature with Attack investment should be used instead of Timid to bolster its damage output. A bulkier spread of 120 HP / 252 SpA / 136 Spe with a Modest nature can be used to outspeed Rillaboom and maximize bulk to check Pokemon like Tapu Lele and Mega Latias better, although it loses out on outspeeding crucial threats like Kyurem, Tapu Lele, and Hydreigon.</p> <p>Victini works best on offense teams that appreciate its compressed defensive capabilities in checking the likes of Mega Latias and Tapu Lele, as well as the offensive pressure it brings to the table.

Trick is a great way to cripple walls like Slowbro, Heatran, and Toxapex, forcing them to lose momentum every time they come in. Final Gambit can eliminate a defensive target entirely, as well as getting a teammate in freely, though this comes at the cost of Victini itself.

Therefore, hyper offensive staples like Rillaboom, Mega Gyarados, and Mega Garchomp make excellent partners. Suicide lead variants of Landorus-T can aid Victini in this role by setting up Stealth Rock and exploding on key defensive targets like Zapdos. This in conjunction with Victini's Final Gambit can often mean that the remaining teammates can clean up very easily. Bulkier offense archetypes enjoy Victini's defensive utility, as its ability to pivot in on huge threats like Mega Charizard Y, Tapu Lele, and Mega Medicham is often a godsend for them. Victini likes to get in unharmed so it can take advantage of its bulk as best as possible, so pivots like Corviknight, Blissey, and Slowbro make good teammates.

Pokemon that appreciate Victini crippling or KOing Pokemon like Heatran, Landorus-T, and Slowbro, such as Mega Mawile, Tapu Koko, and Gliscor, make fantastic partners. Victini can struggle with sturdy Ground-types like Garchomp and Landorus-T that can tank its V-creates decently while wearing it down with Rocky Helmet or Rough Skin, so Pokemon like Weavile, Kyurem, and Ash-Greninja are good choices to deal with them.

Air Balloon reverses the matchup against Ground-types such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. However, these matchups aren't worth being stonewalled by Tangrowth, Slowbro, and Zapdos.

On the Stealth Rock Lead set, Steel Beam may seem like a nice option over Rock Tomb to perform more as a suicide lead, but due to it needing Excadrill to be at a lower HP to effectively work, it is rather undesirable, and it still struggles to keep Stealth Rock up versus Corviknight.

Swords Dance alongside a Z-Move lets Excadrill clean up weakened defensive Pokemon like Slowbro, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Fini. Giga Impact gives it access to Breakneck Blitz, allowing Excadrill to break through common Pokemon like Zapdos as well as chipped Slowbro and Tangrowth after a boost. Rapid Spin can be used if Excadrill's team can't fit Defog elsewhere and gives Excadrill the ability to limit Stealth Rock Clefable, patch up its Speed without the need for sand, and remove entry hazards for Pokemon weak to them like Mega Charizard Y. Toxic can be used in the fourth slot to wear down Slowbro, Tangrowth, Landorus-T, and Zapdos, especially alongside sand damage. Substitute is an option to use non-Body Press Corviknight as setup fodder. Leftovers allows for Excadrill to take advantage of its solid defensive typing, giving it easier setup on Pokemon like Clefable and Tapu Koko. However, forgoing Normalium Z can be detrimental against teams carrying Slowbro, Zapdos, and Tangrowth.

Corviknight effortlessly walls Excadrill, so teammates that can deal with it, such as Zapdos and Magnezone, make excellent teammates. Both are also notable for tearing open physically defensive Tangrowth, which would otherwise halt Excadrill's sweep. Swords Dance and Choice Band Kartana sets are also capable of forcing damage onto Corviknight and Zapdos, causing them to falter at checking Excadrill. Faster Pokemon like Ash-Greninja and Mega Lopunny can exploit Excadrill's mediocre Speed outside of sand, with Ash-Greninja revenge killing it even under sand with Water Shuriken, so partners such as Toxapex, Slowbro, and Corviknight are needed to help remedy this issue.

However, even with this advantage, it still finds itself outclassed by Mew and Landorus-T due to it being unable to prevent Pokemon like Corviknight and Tapu Fini from using Defog and it not having a good defensive typing like the other two do. Setting up Stealth Rock is Excadrill's main role, and when paired with Mold Breaker, it can even set up Stealth Rock against Magic Bounce users like Mega Diancie and Mega Sableye. Mold Breaker also lets Excadrill's Earthquake hit Levitate users like Hydreigon, Rotom-W, and Mega Latias, letting Excadrill not be complete setup fodder against them. Rapid Spin defines Excadrill's niche over other entry hazard leads like Landorus-T and Mew, letting it keep hazards off the field before it gets KOed. Rock Tomb can slow down faster Stealth Rock users like Garchomp and Landorus-T so that Excadrill can use Rapid Spin before they KO it. It can also slow down setup Pokemon that might try to take advantage of Excadrill like Mega Gyarados and Thundurus-T. Focus Sash is chosen as the item so that Excadrill is usually able to get up Stealth Rock before getting KOed.</p> <p>Lead Excadrill exclusively fits on hyper offense teams and, as such, has teammates that are commonly found there. Pokemon that appreciate Excadrill's ability to keep entry hazards off the field such as Gyarados and non-Heavy-Duty Boots variants of Volcarona, Weavile, and Thundurus-T serve as great teammates to pair with it. Excadrill can also function on Sticky Web teams to provide Stealth Rock when the Sticky Web setter is Ribombee while also giving the team a form of entry hazard removal, which Shuckle cannot do. Additionally, due to the nature of hyper offense being rather slow at first, Tapu Koko is especially threatening to the archetype, making Excadrill an important teammate because it resists or is immune to both of Tapu Koko's STAB moves. Pokemon like Weavile and Greninja who have multi-hit moves are also invited in by Excadrill, so it appreciates partners like Mega Gyarados, Mega Scizor, and Kommo-o that can pivot into these Pokemon.</p> "

Thunder alongside Electrium Z nails Slowking and Toxapex. Thunder is also able to spread paralysis, but it does not hit Dark-types, which leaves Reuniclus more vulnerable to Pursuit.

Due to Reuniclus's inability to touch Mega Sableye as well as bad matchup against Aegislash, teammates such as Calm Mind Clefable and Mega Mawile make for solid partners. Reuniclus's Pursuit weakness is also a nuisance, but if paired with Mega Latias, the pair can easily overwhelm opposing Pursuit trappers such as Weavile, Tyranitar, and Mega Tyranitar. Reuniclus can struggle with strong special attackers like Ash-Greninja, Volcarona, and Gengar, especially if it is unboosted. Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Toxapex, Heatran, and Kommo-o can deal with these Pokemon.

This is especially effective considering most Grass-types, as well as the sleep blocking Tapu Fini, cannot safely switch into Amoonguss. This also makes Pokemon that would otherwise be able to absorb Sludge Bomb easily, such as Corviknight and Toxapex, hesitant to switch in due to the threat of Spore. Hidden Power Fire hits Kartana and Ferrothorn while also applying some chip to other Steel-types, such as Mega Scizor, Magnezone, and Mega Mawile.

Heavy-Duty Boots maintains Volcarona's defensive utility through Stealth Rock and gives it better opportunities to set up; meanwhile, Psychium Z allows it to deal incredible neutral damage with a Shattered Psyche at the cost of taking entry hazard damage. Flame Body can punish physical attackers like Rillaboom, Mega Scizor, and Mega Mawile, while a Timid nature lets it naturally outspeed Pokemon like Kyurem, Excadrill, and Urshifu-R, as well as Choice Scarf Landorus-T after a Quiver Dance boost. Modest can be used if more power is desired, grabbing notable KOs such as Kommo-o, Mega Tyranitar, and Garchomp, but Volcarona ends up easier to revenge kill by the likes of Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Mega Garchomp before a boost.</p> <p>Volcarona mainly fits on hyper offense, teams as they appreciate the defensive utility and firepower it brings; in return, Volcarona appreciates hyper offense teammates weakening its checks and counters, as there are a lot of situations where it cannot set up and sweep. Entry hazards delay it if it's been hit by Knock Off, and a healthy Tyranitar, Garchomp, or Heatran can take a hit and KO it back. Good examples of powerful teammates are Bisharp, Rillaboom, Garchomp, and Mega Medicham. Meanwhile, cleaners like Hawlucha, Rillaboom, and Mega Gyarados can clean up late-game after Volcarona has broken through the opposing team. Serperior makes a stellar offensive core with Volcarona as Volcarona handles many of Serperior's checks such as Heatran, Corviknight, and Amoonguss, and Serperior's Glare can give Volcarona better opportunities to set up. Hazard control is also incredibly important when using Volcarona, encouraging teammates like Kartana, Corviknight, Excadrill, and Tapu Fini. Non-Heavy-Duty Boots variants used on hyper offense absolutely need hazard removal through the likes of Excadrill or Regieleki to function. Leads such as Taunt Mew and Excadrill can stop Stealth Rock from being on the field, which Volcarona appreciates, and dual screens support through Grimmsnarl or Tapu Koko makes Volcarona harder to take down and give it more opportunities to set up. Lastly, Gliscor can freely set up on Volcarona's best counters: Heatran, Toxapex, and Blissey.</p> "

Bulky sets carrying Fly with Flyinium Z and U-turn can be useful, as they allow Landorus-T to threaten immediate damage onto offensive Pokemon, such as Mega Medicham and Rillaboom. It also takes advantage of the standard bulky pivot sets tending to lure in Tangrowth. However, the loss of Toxic and Rocky Helmet makes this set worse against Pokemon such as Mega Latias and Mega Mawile.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Slowbro is capable of forcing damage onto Landorus-T and potentially burning it with Scald while also eating unboosted hits rather comfortably, although it fears Toxic and a boosted Supersonic Skystrike.

Its ability to act as a team's Ground-type and answer to fast threats alongside its generally good power and utility moves makes it very easy to put on many teams. It gives teams offensive and defensive weapons against threats such as Heatran, Toxapex, and Tapu Koko. U-turn allows Landorus-T to keep up the momentum and take advantage of the switches it forces from common Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Toxapex, and Heatran. Stone Edge 2HKOes Zapdos, OHKOes Moltres, and allows Landorus-T to revenge kill Mega Charizard Y. Knock Off, on the other hand, removes important items from the likes of Slowbro, Zapdos, Moltres, Tapu Fini, and Tangrowth. Punishment allows Landorus-T to deal with Calm Mind Mega Latias, 2HKOing it after a Calm Mind, as well as Calm Mind Reuniclus. It works especially well with teammates that force Mega Latias to use Calm Mind multiple times, such as Corviknight. Explosion allows Landorus-T to deal more damage to certain threats, such as Garchomp, Gliscor, Kommo-o, and Rotom-W; however, keep in mind that all of them require chip damage before being KOed. Defog can be used if the role compression of having revenge killing and hazard removal in the same teamslot is needed. Unfortunately, being locked into Defog gives foes free turns. Hidden Power Ice can be used to threaten opposing Landorus-T and Garchomp. Earth Power can work on teams that are desperately in need of a reliable Kartana revenge killer and need Landorus-T's role compression. A neutral nature and 76 Special Attack EVs should be run in this case in order to secure the OHKO on Kartana. 244 Speed EVs and a Jolly nature are used to outrun Arctozolt in hail.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types, such as Slowbro and Toxapex, work well with Landorus-T. Slowbro can also form a pivoting core with Landorus-T with Teleport, while Toxapex is capable of taking on Ash-Greninja for Landorus-T. These Water-types also appreciate Landorus-T's Electric immunity, and Toxapex also appreciates the Ground immunity. Strong wallbreakers such as Mega Medicham, Mega Mawile, Kyurem, and Tapu Lele appreciate Landorus-T solidly handling fast threats for them and pivoting them in with U-turn. Mega Mawile and Kyurem are capable of taking advantage of Slowbro, a physical sponge that can generally pivot into Landorus-T safely, and Kyurem can additionally deal with Zapdos. Choice Scarf Landorus-T will get worn down over the course of a game, so having Defog support in the form of Corviknight, Zapdos, or Kartana is very helpful.

U-turn is useful, as it lets Landorus-T pivot out of bad matchups against Corviknight and Slowbro.

Swords Dance boosts Landorus-T's Attack to titanic levels, allowing Earthquake to do enormous damage to even bulky neutral targets and making Explosion much more powerful, notably allowing it to OHKO Zapdos, Gliscor, and Slowbro while doing over 50% to Corviknight.

Hyper offense teams utilizing Choice Scarf Victini can also make Victini the lead instead, as Landorus-T tends to trade Stealth Rock with opposing Stealth Rock setters, and it can be therefore more valuable at times to deny the opponent's Stealth Rock first and send in Landorus-T next. This pair can also take two foes with it quite easily. Staple sweepers on hyper offense such as Mega Gyarados, Belly Drum Kommo-o, Mega Garchomp, and Rillaboom are good teammates, as they all appreciate Stealth Rock wearing down the opposition and Landorus-T opening up a big hole with Explosion early-game.</p> "

Swords Dance Landorus-T is also one of the best Pokemon for breaking stall teams, as the immense power combined with a Z-Move makes checking Landorus-T quite hard for them, even with Unaware Pokemon such as Clefable and Quagsire.

Stone Edge with Rockium Z, on the other hand, lets Landorus-T directly threaten common Defoggers like Corviknight and Zapdos while also allowing it to break through Rotom-W with greater efficiency. It also still has enough power to OHKO Tapu Fini at +2. Its targets are rather limited, however, which makes Flyinium Z the overall superior choice. The Rockium Z set also faces competition from Garchomp, which sits at a significantly better Speed tier that gives it the jump on Mega Medicham, Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Hydreigon, but Landorus-T retains a niche due to compressing a Ground immunity and getting better damage rolls against Corviknight.</p> <p>Late-game cleaners are excellent partners for Landorus-T, as they greatly appreciate Landorus-T weakening or straight up removing bulkier Pokemon while also setting up Stealth Rock.

Freeze-Dry has high PP and super effectively hit Water-types like Slowbro, Slowking, Toxapex, and Tapu Fini that'd resist its other Ice-type STAB options, and Earth Power covers the Steel- and Fire-types that resist Freeze-Dry like Heatran, Mega Mawile, and Victini. 56 HP EVs give Kyurem 101 HP Substitutes so that Seismic Toss from Blissey and Chansey can't break it in one hit.</p> <p>Fast pivots with U-turn like Mega Lopunny, Landorus-T, Jirachi, and Greninja make excellent teammates to Kyurem by baiting in bulky passive Pokemon such as Toxapex, Slowbro, Tangrowth, and Chansey and giving Kyurem a free switch to set up Substitute.

Magnezone is notable due to its ability to completely trap and remove Steel-types like Mega Scizor, Corviknight, and Ferrothorn with Magnet Pull. Because of Kyurem's lack of immediate power, it's also very much setup fodder for Pokemon like Calm Mind Mega Latias, Clefable, and Reuniclus, so Pokemon that can stop these setup sweepers make for good teammates.

In addition, it‘s a terrific wallbreaker thanks to its incredible offenses and good Speed in conjunction with colorful coverage. Diamond Storm is preferred over Power Gem to wear down specially defensive Pokemon like Blissey, Toxapex, and Slowking. Moonblast is a powerful STAB move that easily dispatches Pokemon like Garchomp and Mega Latias while also hitting physical walls like defensive Landorus-T quite hard. Mystical Fire is crucial coverage, as it targets Corviknight and Ferrothorn and discourages Mega Scizor from switching in. Instead of Stealth Rock, Earth Power can be used to snipe Heatran and do more damage to Mega Mawile and Excadrill. Encore can also be used in this moveslot to, for example, lock Corviknight into Defog or Tapu Fini into Calm Mind, allowing Mega Diancie to exploit the switch or revenge kill them. Magic Bounce deters status moves and entry hazards, allowing Mega Diancie to take advantage of passive Pokemon like Mega Sableye and Blissey. 132 Special Attack EVs allow it to 2HKO Corviknight with 72 Special Defense EVs after Stealth Rock, with the remaining EVs going into Attack for better damage rolls against Pokemon like Blissey and Heatran.</p> <p>Mega Diancie fits on bulky offense teams that appreciate its monstrous wallbreaking power and Stealth Rock. Magnezone is a phenomenal teammate thanks to its ability to completely remove Steel-types, allowing Mega Diancie to forgo Mystical Fire entirely. Because of Mega Diancie’s frailty, pivots that can bring it in like Blissey, Slowking, and Corviknight make solid partners. Blissey can also paralyze offensive answers to Mega Diancie such as Greninja and Ash-Greninja, Slowking can use Future Sight to make its attacks indirectly stronger, and Corviknight can check defensive Ground-types like Landorus-T and Gliscor that Mega Diancie can’t break through on its own. Wallbreakers and late-game cleaners such as Swords Dance Kartana and Kyurem appreciate Stealth Rock and Mega Diancie’s ability to wear down several defensive Pokemon, such as Blissey, Heatran, and Mega Scizor. Kartana in particular loves Mega Diancie pressuring Zapdos, Mega Latias, and Corviknight, while Kartana uses the defensive Ground-types that Mega Diancie baits in as setup fodder. Mega Diancie can form solid entry hazard stacking cores with Ferrothorn, Greninja, and Ash-Greninja thanks to their collective ability to beat down Defoggers so that entry hazards can stay up. Ferrothorn can also annoy several of Mega Diancie's checks like Heatran and Blissey with Toxic, Leech Seed, and Knock Off, while Ash-Greninja can beat down the checks it shares with Mega Diancie like Ferrothorn and Toxapex.</p> "

However, due to not being able to run Toxic, Volcanion is often left helpless against the likes of Mega Latias and Slowking, making Pursuit users such as Weavile mandatory alongside it.

Toxapex can pivot into Volcanion, as it resists both of Volcanion's STAB moves and is immune to Toxic; however, Toxapex takes a hefty chunk from Earth Power and often can't consistently pivot into it. Tapu Fini resists both of Volcanion’s STAB options while also being immune to Toxic; however, due to its lack of consistent recovery, it is easily worn down and eventually can lose to Volcanion if it constantly has to switch into it.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage: Due to Volcanion's lack of recovery and susceptibility to all entry hazards, entry hazard chip racks up very quickly in the long term, especially considering Volcanion's crippling weakness to Stealth Rock.

Its longevity also gets compounded due to being forced to switch into Pokemon such as Greninja.</p> <p><strong>Chansey and Blissey: Chansey and Blissey can infinitely switch into Volcanion without worry, heal off any damage done to them, and threaten back with a Seismic Toss or a Toxic.

Furthermore, its ability in Water Absorb and stellar defensive typing allow it to provide solid defensive utility on offense teams, as it can act as a soft check towards threats such as Ash-Greninja, Heatran, and Tapu Fini. However, Volcanion is fairly easy to pivot around due to all of its moves having common resistances or immunities, and it is overdependent on Toxic to break through its checks like Gastrodon and Mega Latias. These issues are compounded by Volcanion's awful longevity due to its crippling weakness to entry hazards. These factors mean that Volcanion faces severe competition from other, more effective wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele and Kartana. Steam Eruption is Volcanion's main STAB move, nailing even neutral targets such as Garchomp and Clefable for large amounts of damage. Flamethrower lets Volcanion hit common Water-resistant Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Serperior. Earth Power is Volcanion's coverage move of choice, letting it threaten Toxapex and Galarian Slowking. Toxic allows Volcanion to slowly whittle down would-be checks in Mega Latias, Slowking, and Gastrodon by badly poisoning them on the switch in. Sludge Wave can also be used as an option over Toxic to hit Tapu Fini extremely hard and deter it from switching in, as well as also being a solid midground against Grass-types, although it means that Volcanion can no longer punish Mega Latias and Gastrodon.</p> <p>Volcanion fits best on offensively oriented teams that appreciate its short-term defensive capabilites and its terrifying wallbreaking prowess. Teammates such as Mega Scizor, Tapu Lele, and Arctozolt appreciate Volcanion's ability to pressure bulky Water- and Steel-types, such as Corviknight, Ferrothorn, opposing Mega Scizor and Toxapex. These Pokemon baiting in Steel- and Water-types provides natural entry points for Volcanion to come in and act as a wallbreaker. Due to Volcanion's susceptibility to entry hazards, Pokemon such as Mega Diancie that can deflect it or good Defoggers such as Corviknight and Kartana make for solid partners. Pokemon that appreciate Volcanion taking the Water- and Fire-type attacks from Ash-Greninja and Heatran directed at them such as Landorus-T and Ferrothorn, respectively, are also good partners. Although Volcanion can pressure out slower Ground-types, faster ones often force it out instead, so Ground-immune Pokemon such as Corviknight and Landorus-T are excellent partners. Electric- immune Pokemon such as the aforementioned Landorus-T and Gliscor also work well due to Volcanion's tendency to be forced out by Electric-types. Lastly, due to Volcanion's inability to check the likes of Ash-Greninja and Heatran by itself, Dark- and Ground-resistant Pokemon, such as Gliscor and Tapu Koko work well with it to round off the defensive core.</p> "

However, Kommo-o is extremely reliant on Belly Drum to do significant damage and requires its Salac Berry to be eaten to actually sweep teams due to its low Speed stat.

Hidden Power Ice lets Tapu Koko hit the Ground-types that are immune to its Electric-type moves like Garchomp, Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Hippowdon. This is incredibly important; a well-timed Hidden Power Ice will cleanly OHKO the former two Ground-types and force the latter two out, and the resulting mind games drastically improve Tapu Koko's ability to generate momentum with Volt Switch. Volt Switch lets Tapu Koko scout the opponent and gain free momentum once the opponent's Ground-type has been removed. Dazzling Gleam gives Tapu Koko a good neutral option against Pokemon that resist Thunderbolt but aren't very threatened by Hidden Power, like opposing Tapu Koko, Hydreigon, and Kyurem. Alternatively, it can run Roost to improve its longevity in more drawn-out games against Pokemon that it forces out, such as Toxapex, Corviknight, and Slowbro. However, Roost forces Tapu Koko to switch out, thereby losing momentum. Grass Knot is another option that lends Tapu Koko the ability to pressure Gastrodon and Mega Swampert much harder, but it is inferior to Dazzling Gleam otherwise.</p> <p>Due to its role as a fast pivot that can generally keep up momentum well, Tapu Koko fits very well on more offensive teams, but it's a fine fit on balanced teams as well. Tapu Koko pairs particularly well with teammates that can bait in Water- and Flying-types such as Toxapex, Slowbro, Tapu Fini, Corviknight, and Zapdos. Such teammates include the likes of Heatran, Ash-Greninja, Greninja, Mega Lopunny, Rillaboom, and Mega Scizor. Moreover, all of these partners bar Heatran are capable of creating pivoting cores with Tapu Koko courtesy of their access to U-turn, with Greninja and Ash-Greninja amplifying progress made through pivoting with Spikes as well. Water-, Grass-, and Ice-types such as Ash-Greninja, Kartana, Rillaboom, and Kyurem can easily pressure most of the metagame's Ground-types, including the ones that are particularly annoying for Tapu Koko such as Gastrodon, Mega Swampert, and Excadrill. On the other hand, Fire-types such as Mega Charizard Y and Heatran take advantage of Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss, which can otherwise keep Tapu Koko at bay for extended amounts of time. Due to Tapu Koko's tendency to force plenty of switches and rack up damage with Volt Switch, good entry hazard setters such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and the aforementioned Heatran, Greninja, and Ash-Greninja make for good teammates that can greatly speed up the rate at which Tapu Koko can break teams down. Tapu Koko also likes having strong physical wallbreakers on its side to deal with the more specially defensive Pokemon that check it such as Blissey, Ferrothorn, Amoonguss, and Gastrodon. Pokemon like Mega Mawile, Mega Medicham, and Hawlucha make for great teammates to pressure these special walls, with the latter two also having great synergy with Electric Terrain. Lastly, as Tapu Koko is quite frail and prone to revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Rillaboom, and Ash-Greninja as a result, it appreciates a defensive backbone that can sponge up hits from these threats. On bulky offense teams, Pokemon such as bulky Landorus-T, Slowbro, Corviknight, and Blissey can provide said backbone while also maintaining momentum with their pivoting moves. On balanced teams, the likes of Toxapex, Clefable, and Corviknight can fulfill the same objective.</p> "

Calm Mind gives it the power to pressure defensive pivots like Heatran, Galarian Slowking, and Mega Scizor and overwhelm them. Its Speed tier is quite handy, allowing it to outspeed the likes of Landorus-T, Mega Garchomp, and Excadrill, but it misses out on Urshifu-R, Volcarona, Garchomp, and Victini. This, and Tapu Lele's mediocre bulk, makes revenge killing it pretty easy, making it hard to outright sweep. Psychic can break down physically defensive walls like Clefable and Gliscor, while Psyshock focuses more on hitting specially defensive Pokemon like Blissey and Chansey. Both are very strong thanks to Psychic Terrain's boost. Moonblast provides a reliable way of hitting Dark-types like Ash-Greninja, Weavile, and Hydreigon that are immune Psychic, and it's stronger while outside of Psychic Terrain. Focus Blast allows Tapu Lele to hit annoying Steel-types and, with Fightinium Z, it can nuke the likes of Corviknight, Mega Tyranitar, and Mega Scizor without risking a miss. Psychium Z can also be run with Psyshock for an extremely powerful Z-Move to take down both physically and specially defensive walls, creating rather big holes in defensive teams, and notably preventing Unaware Clefable from using Calm Mind to stop Tapu Lele in its tracks.</p> <p>Calm Mind Tapu Lele fits well on bulky offense teams, but it can also be used on offense. Magnezone, Heatran, Mega Garchomp, and Mega Mawile can break down Steel-type Pokemon like Heatran, Ferrothorn, Corviknight, and Mega Scizor that can take on Tapu Lele's STAB moves well, especially enabling Psychium Z sets. Tapu Lele's summoned Psychic Terrain strengthens attacks from teammates like Mega Medicham and Psychic Volcarona. It also protects teammates like Mega Garchomp, Volcarona, and Mega Gyarados from revenge killers with priority like Mega Lopunny, Mega Medicham, and Ash-Greninja, letting them set up and sweep much more easily. A sturdy defensive backbone is appreciated against physical threats such as Kartana, Weavile, and Garchomp that revenge kill Tapu Lele well.

Swords Dance and a respectable Attack stat make it an offensive threat as well. However, Tapu Bulu faces competition from more specialized offensive or defensive Grass-types such as Rillaboom, Kartana, Ferrothorn, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss. It also struggles to switch into defensive Water-types like Toxapex, Slowbro, and Slowking, as it fears a Scald burn. With Grassy Terrain, Horn Leech hits neutral Pokemon such as Tapu Lele, Garchomp, and Gliscor hard, as well as providing recovery. Superpower lets Tapu Bulu hit Grass-resistant Pokemon such as Ferrothorn, Heatran, and Corviknight, and it's chosen over Close Combat due to not reducing Tapu Bulu's Special Defense, letting it check Ash-Greninja and Tapu Koko effectively.

Volcarona and Heatran are especially great, as they take advantage of the bulky Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss that Tapu Bulu lures in. The passive recovery from Grassy Terrain gives Pokemon lacking reliable recovery such as Tyranitar and Melmetal vastly increased longevity.

Additionally, Xurkitree is rather frail, making it vulnerable to priority from the likes of Rillaboom, Mega Lopunny, and Weavile. Faster Pokemon that ignore Sticky Web also present issues, with Ground-immune Pokemon such as Mega Latias, Mega Latios, and Hydreigon as well as Heavy-Duty Boots users such as Zeraora, Victini, and Tapu Koko all fitting the bill. Xurkitree should therefore almost never be run on any serious competitive team.</p> <p>Hidden Power Ice allows Xurkitree to blast through Garchomp and Gliscor while also hitting Dragon-types like Kommo-o and Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Tangrowth. Energy Ball gets past Gastrodon, Hippowdon, and Quagsire. Shuca Berry allows Xurkitree to beat Landorus-T in conjunction with Hidden Power Ice, as Landorus-T is not affected by Sticky Webs and always beats this set otherwise. It also allows Xurkitree to set up on other Ground-types if necessary. Shuckle can set up Sticky Webs and Stealth Rock to support Xurkitree's sweep, and a Defiant user such as Bisharp or Contrary Serperior can help keep the entry hazards up by dissuading and punishing Defog attempts. Other Sticky Web attackers such as Mega Scizor, Mega Heracross, Kommo-o, and Thundurus-T are useful teammates. Unfortunately, the latter essentially invalidates Xurkitree by performing its role almost entirely better.</p> "

These perks alongside its massive physical bulk allow it to stay in on threats and potentially trade KOs, check common Pokemon such as Calm Mind Clefable, Weavile, and Tapu Lele, and cripple potential switch-ins with Thunder Wave. However, Melmetal has a terrible Speed tier, requiring a lot of investment to even outspeed slow threats, which can cut into its bulk. Its special bulk is also quite mediocre, and in conjunction with its lack of recovery, this leaves Melmetal easily worn down. Melmetal’s STAB typing is also lackluster, meaning it is relatively easy to pivot into by a majority of the tier. Thunder Punch allows Melmetal to nail Water- and Flying-types that can switch into Double Iron Bash, such as Corviknight, Toxapex, and Slowbro. Earthquake is a strong coverage option that always 2HKOes Toxapex while also hitting Heatran. However, Superpower can be used to maintain the ability to hit Heatran while nailing Ferrothorn, which doesn't mind Melmetal's other coverage options. Thunder Wave gives Melmetal the ability to paraflinch checks like Corviknight, Toxapex, Skarmory, and Mega Scizor or wear them down to assist teammates in overwhelming them. Leftovers is used to increase Melmetal's longevity, letting it check Pokemon such as Clefable and Tapu Fini better, while Protective Pads is an option to ignore adverse contact effects like Skarmory’s, Landorus’s, and Tangrowth’s Rocky Helmet, as well as Volcarona’s Flame Body and Zapdos's Static. The given EV spread allows Melmetal to outspeed a paralyzed Heatran, with the rest in Special Defense to maximize its special bulk.</p> <p>Melmetal fits best on bulky offense teams that appreciate its solid defensive utility, being able to check Fairy- and Ice-types such as Clefable and Weavile, and its strong wallbreaking capabilities. Dragon-types such as Garchomp, Mega Latios, and Mega Latias make solid partners, as they appreciate Melmetal's ability to spread paralysis and check Fairy- and Ice-types. In return, they cover Melmetal's weaknesses to Fire- and Ground-types: Garchomp checks Fire-types like Heatran, and Mega Latios and Latias check Ground-types like opposing Garchomp. Due to Melmetal’s lack of reliable recovery, Grassy Terrain support from the likes of Rillaboom and Tapu Bulu is greatly appreciated, and in return, they both pressure Flying-types such as Corviknight and Zapdos to aid Melmetal in wallbreaking. Grassy Terrain also weakens opposing Earthquakes, allowing Melmetal to stay in and pressure Ground-types better. Strong entry hazard support from the likes of Greninja, Clefable, and Landorus-T augments Melmetal's ability to pressure opposing teams, as the constant chip damage quickly wears down its checks that try to pivot around it. Tapu Fini is a stellar partner, as its Misty Terrain prevents Melmetal from being statused by the likes of Mega Sableye’s Will-O-Wisp and adverse contact effects like Zapdos’s Static. However, it does prevent Melmetal from paralyzing grounded Pokemon such as Heatran and Mega Scizor, which can prove costly in games. Lastly, fast revenge killers fast revenge killers such as Mega Lopunny, Ash Greninja, Glare Serperior, and Tapu Koko all work well with Melmetal, as they can take on the faster threats that Melmetal can't due to its low Speed.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Arctozolt can use Freeze-Dry over Low Kick in order to make its matchup against Gastrodon and Mega Swampert easier, but it loses its ability to hit Steel-types such as Ferrothorn and Melmetal hard, making them difficult to deal with. An Adamant nature can be used over Naive in order to boost the power of its Bolt Beak and Low Kick; however, it loses its ability to outspeed Pokemon such as Tyranitar and specially defensive Heatran without hail and Zeraora in hail.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types such as Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Mega Scizor can all take hits from Arctozolt and wear it down with their attacks. However, Ferrothorn cannot switch into Low Kick consistently, and Melmetal and Mega Scizor have to be wary of pivoting into Bolt Beak.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Arctozolt's Speed is very underwhelming when hail isn't active, so Pokemon such as Kartana, Heatran, and Mega Lopunny can revenge kill it fairly reliably. Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T, Tapu Lele, and Victini can revenge kill even in hail. Additionally, Arctozolt can be revenge killed by priority if it isn't behind a Substitute due to its middling bulk, so priority users such as Ash-Greninja, Rillaboom, and Mega Lopunny can be troublesome for it.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Weather: Pelipper and Tyranitar can change the weather and remove hail, making Arctozolt much less threatening as a result and causing it to be outsped by other weather sweepers such as Mega Swampert and Excadrill; however, neither Pelipper or Tyranitar want to switch into Arctozolt, as they can get KOed or take significant damage.</p> <p><strong>Mega Latias: After a Calm Mind, Mega Latias can stall out Arctozolt's Blizzard with Roost, as well as stalling out Arctozolt's hail turns, as it cannot be 2HKOed after a Calm Mind. It cannot switch into Blizzard, however, especially with Stealth Rock up.</p> <p><strong>Gastrodon</strong>: Without Freeze-Dry, Gastrodon isn't threatened by any of Arctozolt's moves and can force it out and significantly damage it with Earthquake.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Arctozolt acts as a very threatening wallbreaker and sweeper under hail due to its high-Base Power moves and amazing STAB combination, making it a great revenge killer, as well as making it very difficult for many teams to pivot. However, Arctozolt suffers from being easily revenge killed by Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T, Victini, and Kartana due to its poor defensive typing, mediocre bulk, and Speed tier that's easily outsped, especially outside of hail. Freeze-Dry can be used over Blizzard in order to heavily damage and KO Gastrodon and Mega Swampert, which would otherwise take Blizzard and KO Arctozolt with their Ground-type STAB move; however, Blizzard is a more consistent and threatening move due to its high Base Power, making it superior otherwise. Low Kick allows Arctozolt to bypass would-be checks like Magnezone, Ferrothorn, and Tyranitar. Substitute is great for taking advantage of Pokemon that get forced out by Arctozolt, such as Toxapex, Garchomp, and Corviknight, while also easing prediction by blocking status and abilities such as Landorus-T's Intimidate, making Arctozolt harder to pivot around. However, Substitute drains Arctozolt's HP and can waste hail turns, making it situational to use. Heavy-Duty Boots is the preferred item for Arctozolt, as it negates entry hazards, allowing Arctozolt to wreak havoc against the opposing team regardless of if hazards are on the field; however, Leftovers is a good alternative, as it can keep Arctozolt healthy throughout a match, although it necessitates hazard control as a result.</p> <p>Alolan Ninetales is an absolute necessity for Arctozolt, since it provides hail while also providing utility, such as setting up Aurora Veil to make it less prone to revenge killing and easier for it to switch in and overwhelm the foe. Alolan Ninetales can use Freeze-Dry to help with Arctozolt's Gastrodon and Mega Swampert matchup, allowing Arctozolt to free up Blizzard. Alolan Ninetales can also support it by locking the foe into a move with Encore, allowing Arctozolt to pivot in safely. Mega Diancie is also a great partner for Arctozolt, since it sets up Stealth Rock for Arctozolt to make it harder to switch into and pivot around, and Mega Diancie's Magic Bounce deflects the foe's entry hazards, allowing Arctozolt to switch in multiple times and wreak havoc without the worry of taking hazard damage. If Arctozolt isn't using Heavy-Duty Boots, then Defoggers such as Corviknight are very useful for Arctozolt. Priority and Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T, Mega Scizor, and Rillaboom can be annoying for Arctozolt to handle, so checks to them such as Landorus-T, Heatran, and Corviknight are great teammates for it. Pokemon that can bring Arctozolt in safely such as Landorus-T and Corviknight work as good teammates. Toxic support from Pokemon like Landorus-T and Heatran can be useful for Arctozolt, as it can ease up its worst matchups in Gastrodon and Mega Latias.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Urshifu-R can use Protective Pads alongside Taunt, allowing it to disturb defensive presences like Toxapex and Tapu Fini while maintaining momentum with U-turn without being subject to chip damage from using its contact moves. Bulk Up sets using Electrium Z can be used to lure in Toxapex, Tapu Fini, Slowbro, and Slowking, but they can often falter against fast-paced offensive teams and struggle to set up against defensive teams. In addition, the set requires multiple Bulk Ups to achieve success due to the initial lack of power.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Toxapex, Tapu Fini, Slowbro, and Slowking are incredibly annoying to Urshifu-R, as they resist its STAB moves and can retaliate with a Scald burn or threaten it with their other STAB moves. Toxapex and Tapu Fini can also remove Urshifu-R's Choice Band with Knock Off, while Slowbro and Slowking can gain momentum with Teleport. However, Tapu Fini can be chipped easily, and Slowbro and Slowking are smacked by U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Tangrowth and Amoonguss easily take anything Urshifu-Rbcan throw at them, although the latter dislikes Zen Headbutt. Both can also put Urshifu-R to sleep or use Giga Drain to dispatch it. Offensive Grass-types like Rillaboom, Serperior, and Kartana, while not safe switch-ins, are great revenge killers to Urshifu-R.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Urshifu-R's average Speed tier means that faster Pokemon like Mega Diancie, Tapu Koko, Mega Medicham, and Zeraora can easily outrun and KO it. However, they are not safe switch-ins.</p> <p><strong>Mega Latias: Mega Latias eats both Surging Strikes and Close Combat comfortably while not fearing Future Sight and denting Urshifu-R with Psyshock. However, it takes a decent amount from U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Contact Damage and Status</strong>: Rocky Helmet, Garchomp's Rough Skin, and Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs severely damage Urshifu-R if it locks into Surging Strikes. Zapdos's Static and Volcarona's Flame Body similarly cripple it with paralysis or a burn.</p> ",

In addition, Unseen Fist makes Urshifu-R difficult to scout properly despite being Choice-locked. U-turn dents Slowbro and Slowking while allowing Urshifu-R to keep momentum against Pokemon it can't touch, such as Toxapex, Tangrowth, and Tapu Fini. Aqua Jet lets Urshifu-R revenge kill faster Pokemon and setup sweepers like Mega Diancie, weakened Tapu Koko, and Volcarona. Zen Headbutt dents Toxapex and Amoonguss, which have no issue taking Urshifu-R's STAB moves.</p> <p>Urshifu-R fits on offense teams that appreciate its great power and ability to maintain momentum with U-turn. Because of its inability to damage Toxapex, Tangrowth, and Tapu Fini with its STAB moves, Urshifu-R mandates Future Sight support from Slowking, Slowbro, or Galarian Slowking. Water-types like Toxapex, Slowking, and Tapu Fini can easily take Urshifu-R's STAB moves, so Pokemon like Tapu Koko, Kartana, and Rillaboom make for solid teammates. Tapu Koko is also notable for handling Zapdos, which can often shut down Urshifu-R with paralysis. Pokemon like Heatran, Corviknight, and Mega Scizor deal with Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss. The latter two also form potent VoltTurn cores that let their team keep momentum and maintain offensive pressure against the opposing team.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Zarude can utilize Leftovers for extra longevity so it isn't overly reliant on Jungle Healing for recovery; however, this greatly reduces its wallbreaking power. Grassium Z can also be used in order to beat Unaware Clefable and and have an even stronger nuke; however, you sacrifice its matchup versus much more common threats like Zapdos, Heatran, and Tangrowth. Heavy-Duty Boots is another option to repeatedly set up without being bothered by hazards, but you lose out on the power of Z-moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Pokemon such as Mega Mawile, Tapu Koko, and Mega Diancie can all either take a boosted hit from Zarude or outspeed it and KO. Mega Mawile in particular is an exceptional check due to Intimidate before Mega Evolving, good bulk, resistance to both of Zarude's moves, and the power to OHKO even after Defense boosts, which allow it to switch in multiple times and force it out. Unaware Clefable stonewalls Zarude and can use it as setup fodder. Clefable must be wary of Grassium Z though, and it must remain at full HP to avoid being 2HKOed by Power Whip.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Pokemon such as Mega Charizard Y, Volcarona, and Heatran can KO Zarude, but Zarude outspeeds them and can OHKO with a boosted Black Hole Eclipse. Heatran can stomach an unboosted Black Hole Eclipse and OHKO Zarude in return with Magma Storm or Inferno Overdrive. Both Moltres and Volcarona can burn Zarude with Flame Body, making it waste a turn removing the status instead of outright KOing them.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-types and Fighting-type Coverage: Hawlucha, Galarian Zapdos, and Mega Lopunny all can switch into Zarude multiple times and threaten to KO it. Furthermore, Fighting-type coverage on the likes of Alakazam, Kartana, and Melmetal can force it out also.</p> <p><strong>Bug-types and Bug-type Coverage: Due to Zarude's crippling 4x Bug weakness, it is extremely prone to being U-turn fodder for the likes of Landorus-T and Rillaboom. Mega Scizor and Mega Heracross also force Zarude out due to their strong Bug-type STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types: Weavile can revenge kill Zarude if brought in safely, but, due to its frailty, it struggles to switch in. Kyurem can force out Zarude and take a boosted Darkest Lariat, but it fears a boosted Z-Move. Both are also prone to Stealth Rock chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Entry Hazards: Entry hazards can easily overwhelm and wear Zarude down long term due to its reliance on its relatively poor recovery move.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Zarude functions as a late-game wincon that's hard to stop once it gets going, since the combination of Bulk Up and Jungle Healing bolsters its good bulk to outlast bulkier foes. Bulk Up and its amazing Speed tier also make it hard to revenge kill. It outpaces many common threats such as Volcarona, Kyurem, and Tapu Lele, even if it's outsped by common revenge killers such as Tapu Koko, Mega Lopunny, and Greninja. However, Zarude faces competition as an offensive Grass-type from Rillaboom, Kartana, and Serperior due to it lacking immediate power. Jungle Healing allows it to shrug off crippling status, like paralysis and Toxic, and recover any chip damage it has sustained from Scald burns; however, it isn't a reliable source of recovery long term. Darkinium Z allows it to nuke would-be checks such as Zapdos, Mega Scizor, and Corviknight, and Darkest Lariat beats the likes of Iron Defense Skarmory and Corviknight by bypassing their Defense boosts. Power Whip is Zarude's strongest move, hitting Dark-resistant Pokemon such as Tyranitar, Clefable, and Tapu Fini. Furthermore, it lets Zarude hit neutral targets such as Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Tapu Lele much harder than Darkest Lariat.</p> <p>Zarude fits on bulkier balance teams, which can provide it with long-term support in the form of entry hazard stacking and other sweepers. Strong hazard support from the likes of Toxic Spikes Toxapex and Spikes Skarmory is extremely beneficial to wear down Zarude's checks in the long run, such as Tangrowth and Unaware Clefable. Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Mega Lopunny, and Ash-Greninja appreciate Zarude breaking down bulkier teams and help its struggles with faster-paced teams. Other setup sweepers such as Calm Mind Clefable, Bulk Up Corviknight, and Mega Latias all appreciate Zarude weakening or KOing their checks, with Clefable especially enjoying it KOing Heatran and Mega Scizor. Zarude also needs sturdy Fire-resistant Pokemon because they force it to switch out or waste its Z-Move, so partners such as Toxapex, Mega Latias, and Heatran are greatly appreciated. Lastly, Pokemon such as Corviknight and Skarmory that can switch into revenge killers that threaten Zarude, such as Mega Lopunny, Hawlucha, Landorus-T, and Kartana, are required. Zarude’s typing gives it amazing defensive utility, allowing it to solidly check Ash-Greninja and switch into Slowbro and Slowking; however, Scald burns forcing it to use Jungle Healing can easily be taken advantage of. It can also reliably switch into Ground-types such as Gliscor and Garchomp and threaten them out. These defensive capabilities make it a good partner with the likes of Heatran, Gliscor, and Mega Diancie.</p> "
