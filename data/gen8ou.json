    "overview": "<p>Nidoking is equipped with an incredible STAB combination that is amplified by its ability Sheer Force and a Life Orb, allowing it to operate as a powerful special wallbreaker despite its mediocre base Special Attack. In addition, it boasts phenomenal coverage options such as Thunderbolt, Flamethrower, and Ice Beam that allow it to reliably pressure switch-ins to its STAB attacks such as Slowking, Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Landorus-T. Nidoking's defensive typing is solid as well, letting it take advantage of Pokemon like Tapu Koko and Clefable for wallbreaking opportunities as well as providing it with a handy Toxic and Thunder Wave immunity. However, its bulk and Speed tier leave much to be desired. It is very prone to being revenge killed by faster threats like offensive Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Tapu Lele and struggles to find natural wallbreaking opportunities due to its frailty, relying on pivoting allies that can switch it in safely. Despite its good defensive typing, Nidoking's fragility also makes it difficult to utilize consistently, especially if it sustains prior chip damage. On top of this, Nidoking is reliant on its item to do damage due to its mediocre Special Attack, making it susceptible to Knock Off. This can be particularly troublesome against Clefable, which Nidoking can otherwise take advantage of. Special walls such as Blissey and Slowking are problematic as well, having no qualms switching into most of its attacks and gaining momentum on its escape with Teleport.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Taunt allows Nidoking to exploit its small subset of switch-ins by incapacitating most forms of progress, such as Teleport and entry hazard removal, or hazard setup. Taunt mainly punishes Blissey, greatly limiting its utility and providing the Nidoking user with an opportunity to capitalize on it. However, Taunt is a move that needs to be used aggressively to get value, which can conflict with Nidoking's role as a wallbreaker. Alternatively, Focus Punch can be used for the luring and dispatching of Blissey, putting it in range of a subsequent STAB move. This can open Nidoking for more wallbreaking opportunities against teams that are overreliant on Blissey as their special backbone; however, Focus Punch is extremely matchup reliant and has little to no utility against other Pokemon. Lastly, Stealth Rock can be used on teams lacking a Stealth Rock setter, enabling Nidoking to set the hazard on forced switches. Though, using the move limits Nidoking's wallbreaking potential greatly.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon: Nidoking is extremely susceptible to revenge killing from a wide range of offensive Pokemon like Landorus-T, Rillaboom, Dragapult, and Urshifu-R that can take advantage of its mediocre bulk and Speed tier to force it out and create progress with options such as Stealth Rock, Knock Off, and U-turn.</p> <p><strong>Ground-types: Landorus-T and Garchomp can scare out Nidoking with their greater Speed and super effective STAB attacks. Landorus-T, particularly, is not bothered by Nidoking's STAB attacks but can easily be overwhelmed by its coverage if utilized recklessly. Gastrodon and Swampert, additionally, are willing to take on Nidoking and scare it out with their respective STAB moves; the latter, however, can also be overwhelmed due to its lack of reliable recovery.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Blissey is a counter to most Nidoking variants that can reliably switch into any one of its special attacks, being only somewhat deterred by Taunt and the situational Focus Punch. Galarian Slowking, Slowking, and Tyranitar are also capable of taking its hits if healthy.</p> <p><strong>Item Removal: Nidoking is reliant on its Life Orb for its damage output; for this reason, Nidoking losing its Life Orb to Knock Off or Trick greatly mitigates the threat of its power. Additionally, given Knock Off's prevalence, Nidoking's susceptibility to the move allows Knock Off users to safely force progress using it against the Nidoking user's team.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Nidoking uses Thunderbolt as its most consistent coverage option, super effectively damaging Slowking and Corviknight. Thunder is an alternative that applies much more pressure to Slowking and OHKOes Tornadus-T as they switch in at the cost of a lower accuracy; however, a Modest nature is necessary if Thunder is used to create a more favorable roll to KO Slowking with a subsequent Sludge Wave. Flamethrower is another coverage option that reliably OHKOes Ferrothorn and Scizor and can apply pressure to Landorus-T switch-ins. Alternatively, Ice Beam targets Landorus-T and Garchomp but gives Nidoking a more difficult time in pressuring Ferrothorn, which can take advantage of it by using Knock Off, Leech Seed, or Spikes. Substitute is another option that lets Nidoking fully capitalize on a forced switch and safely force damage on a target of its choice without the threat of being knocked out beforehand, which greatly eases the need for prediction, but forces Nidoking to drop an additional coverage option. A Modest nature provides the Nidoking user with a more fruitful damage output and a much more favorable roll to 2HKO Slowking with Thunderbolt. However, Timid allows Nidoking to outspeed Tapu Bulu, Modest Tapu Lele, and Zapdos.</p> <p>Nidoking's inability to find many natural wallbreaking opportunities makes it a phenomenal partner with offensive pivots such as Tapu Koko and Dragapult that can provide it with opportunities to switch in safely. The former is able to apply great pressure to checks like Corviknight and Slowking while pivoting against bulky Grass-types like Ferrothorn; its Electric Terrain, additionally, boosts Nidoking's Thunderbolt, which is prominent against Slowking. The latter pivots against bulky Fairy-types like Tapu Fini and Clefable while applying pressure to Slowking with its Ghost-type STAB attacks. Additionally, it is capable of utilizing Thunder Wave to slow down Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, turning them into wallbreaking fodder for Nidoking. Nidoking also pairs well with defensive pivots like Corviknight and Rotom-W, which give Nidoking a safe wallbreaking opportunity against Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Grass-types like Tangrowth. They, additionally, can give Nidoking a good escape option against potential revenge killers like Tapu Lele for Corviknight and Landorus-T in Rotom-W's case. Slowking can also find good pivoting opportunities against Tapu Koko and Tangrowth while giving Nidoking the ability to exploit Toxapex for a wallbreaking opportunity. In addition, entry hazards and Knock Off are valuable tools that can greatly aid Nidoking's wallbreaking abilities by forcing checks like Slowking and Landorus-T to fold to its coverage. Ferrothorn, for example, boasts access to Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Knock Off to remove Slowking's Heavy-Duty Boots and more effectively pressure it. Landorus-T is also capable of using Stealth Rock and Knock Off, as well as pivoting against opposing Tangrowth, Ferrothorn, and Tapu Fini with U-turn and providing Nidoking with a wallbreaking opportunity. Clefable is also a solid Stealth Rock setter that has access to Knock Off.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Clefable's typing, decent bulk, and access to an amazing ability in Magic Guard as well as reliable recovery make it a great Pokemon. A wide movepool gives Clefable a bunch of options with utility moves such as Stealth Rock as well as fantastic coverage moves like Flamethrower and Thunderbolt to hit Pokemon that would otherwise switch in safely such as Ferrothorn and Toxapex. Furthermore, access to Knock Off makes Clefable much harder to punish, as its checks are severely hindered by having their item removed. Thanks to this, Clefable can fit on a bunch of bulky offense and balance teams as a defensive entry hazard setter or a Calm Mind user. Despite all the features that make Clefable a great Pokemon, its somewhat disappointing natural bulk often means it can get overwhelmed by offensive Pokemon it might be used to check like Garchomp and Landorus-T after they use Swords Dance. Clefable's mediocre defensive stats can be especially problematic in longer games because it's often used as a switch-in to a lot of Pokemon.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A Wish + Teleport set can be used to support Clefable's teammates. However, Clefable isn't the most effective Wish passer, as it lets in Pokemon such as Scizor, Melmetal, and Nidoking that prevent it from using Teleport safely. A specially defensive set can be used to let Clefable take on the likes of Hydreigon and Dragapult better, but this set can't take on physical attackers like Garchomp and Landorus-T as effectively and is inferior in most cases. Unaware can be used so that Clefable can take on setup sweepers like Swords Dance Garchomp and Landorus-T. However, without Magic Guard, Clefable is a lot more susceptible to being worn down by entry hazards or status effects and requires strong entry hazard removal. A set with Choice Scarf and Trick can be used to cripple Pokemon like Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Blissey, making it easier for Clefable's teammates to take them on. However, this set has limited utility, as Trick is often useless after being used once, and Clefable only has one other moveslot to choose between Stealth Rock, Calm Mind, and a coverage move. Similarly, a set with Sticky Barb and Trick can be used to wear down Pokemon that switch into Clefable, but it also has limited utility for the same reason. Thunder Wave can be used to spread paralysis and is especially useful for crippling Pokemon like Heatran. Aromatherapy can be used to heal status conditions, which is appreciated especially by teammates such as Garchomp, Landorus-T, and Rillaboom.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types like Scizor, Melmetal, and Excadrill can switch in and force out Clefable. Ferrothorn and Corviknight can switch in multiple times and pressure Clefable if they have a super effective move or set up entry hazards in the case of Ferrothorn. However, they all dislike being hit by Knock Off and need to be wary of Flamethrower or, in the case of Corviknight, Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Heatran is one of the best counters to Clefable, taking very little from its attacks and hitting back very hard. Other Fire-types like Victini, Volcarona, and Moltres can also switch into Clefable. However, getting their Heavy-Duty Boots removed by Knock Off will limit their longevity if entry hazards are up. Moltres also needs to be wary of Thunderbolt.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Poison-types such as Toxapex, Galarian Slowking, and Nidoking can all switch into Moonblast; the latter two can threaten Clefable with super effective attacks. However, Nidoking gets a lot weaker if it loses its Life Orb to Knock Off, and Toxapex can lose to the combination of Calm Mind and Thunderbolt. Assault Vest Galarian Slowking can also lose to Calm Mind sets.</p> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers: Despite its decent bulk, Clefable can get overwhelmed by strong wallbreakers like Rillaboom, Swords Dance Garchomp, and Landorus-T.</p> ",

Alternatively, Wish is a very useful move that can be used if Clefable's team already has a Stealth Rock user. It supports teammates such as Heatran and Ferrothorn by keeping them healthy throughout the game. Knock Off cripples any switch-in by removing its item, especially Leftovers from checks like Heatran or Ferrothorn, which limits their usefulness over the course of the game. While Leftovers provides passive recovery to keep Clefable healthy and allow it to switch into attacks better, Rocky Helmet is an alternative to punish physical attacks such as U-turn from Landorus-T, Dragapult, and Mandibuzz that usually want to pivot out against Clefable. 56 Special Defense EVs with a Calm nature allow Clefable to live back-to-back uses of Freeze-Dry from Kyurem and Hex from Dragapult with and without Leftovers respectively. The rest of its EVs go into Defense to allow for it to take consecutive hits from Pokemon like Dragonite.</p> <p>Offensive Pokemon like Melmetal, Heatran, and Rillaboom can often overwhelm Clefable, so checks to them are good teammates.

Flamethrower hits Steel-types like Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Excadrill, while Thunderbolt lets Clefable hit Toxapex, Corviknight and Moltres super effectively and is its best attack to wear down Heatran. Knock Off can be run instead of a coverage move to remove Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots from certain Pokemon, limiting their longevity and allowing Clefable to find easier wallbreaking and sweeping opportunities. Thunder is a less accurate alternative to Thunderbolt that hits the aforementioned Electric-weak Pokemon much harder while also having a higher chance to paralyze Heatran as it switches in. Life Orb gives Clefable a boost that makes it much harder to switch into, allowing it to 2HKO offensive Melmetal with Flamethrower and making it much easier to beat Toxapex one-on-one with Thunderbolt. Magic Guard keeps Clefable from taking Life Orb recoil, allowing it to sweep more easily and throw off attacks without taking extra damage. It also prevents Clefable from taking entry hazard and Toxic damage, allowing it to stay healthy when switching in and find more opportunities to set up. 60 Speed EVs allow for Clefable to outspeed uninvested Corviknight.</p> <p>Bulky Water-types such as Toxapex, Slowbro, and Slowking can switch into Melmetal, while the latter two can also take on Heatran for Clefable if they're healthy.

Ferrothorn can set up entry hazards, which is really useful for wearing down Clefable's switch-ins, as well as covering Melmetal, while Corviknight can take on Excadrill. Since Clefable can weaken or KO bulky Steel-types with Flamethrower, Pokemon that take advantage of this like Excadrill, Melmetal, and Rillaboom are good teammates. Rillaboom can also pivot with U-turn to bring Clefable in safely against Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Corviknight. Garchomp is an excellent teammate that appreciates Clefable KOing Corviknight.

In addition to setting rain and pivoting, Pelipper can also use Defog to remove entry hazards, which can greatly benefit the team by freeing up a moveslot for Zapdos. Ferrothorn is also a valuable teammate, since it can switch into opposing Electric-types like Tapu Koko and provide Spikes support to help Zapdos and its teammates break through teams more easily. These two can also check offensive Grass-types like Kartana and Rillaboom together. Garchomp makes a good partner for its Electric immunity and access to Stealth Rock, and in return Zapdos checks the offensive Grass-types it struggles with.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Galarian Zapdos is an extremely powerful wallbreaker in OU, capable of taking the top off of most teams with its powerful STAB move combination of Brave Bird and Close Combat. Due to Defiant, Galarian Zapdos possesses the unique trait of threatening both Landorus-T and Corviknight's Defog with an Attack boost, which can nearly guarantee a KO. With even a +1 boost from Defiant, Galarian Zapdos threatens a KO on Corviknight with Close Combat, and with a +2 boost, Toxapex is OHKOed with Brave Bird. Furthermore, its access to U-turn allows Galarian Zapdos to act as a strong pivot, as it forces many defensive Pokemon out such as Ferrothorn and Heatran along with slower offensive threats like Tapu Lele and Urshifu-R. U-turn also is a strong midground play against Slowbro, which is a common switch-in to Galarian Zapdos on Regenerator team structures. However, its powerful Brave Bird comes with the drawback of recoil damage, which, when compounded with passive damage caused by Rocky Helmet, Iron Barbs, or Stealth Rock, can greatly limit its staying power. On the other hand, locking into Close Combat also comes at a cost, as it gives Fighting-type answers like Dragapult and Tapu Lele a free switch-in.</p> ",

Thunderous Kick is a middle ground option for breaking through Corviknight even as it heals that does not come with Close Combat's drawback of lowering Galarian Zapdos's defenses. Stomping Tantrum is another option that acts as a way of pressuring bulky Poison-types like Toxapex and Galarian Slowking without Brave Bird recoil while also hitting Tapu Koko on the switch and Aegislash super effectively. Drill Peck is another option for the third moveslot that gives Galarian Zapdos more staying power than using Brave Bird constantly and is good for picking off weakened enemies. U-turn is helpful for generating momentum against healthy Regenerator cores and scouting if locking into Brave Bird or Close Combat is not desirable.</p> <p>Galarian Zapdos fits best on offensively oriented teams due to its incredible breaking power and ability to build momentum. Pivots like Dragapult and Tapu Fini help Galarian Zapdos get on the field safely while chipping away at foes health to allow Galarian Zapdos to more easily wallbreak. Tornadus-T, particularly Assault Vest variants, is an excellent pivot that pairs well with Galarian Zapdos, as it is able to both spam Knock Off and eat most hits that would otherwise KO Galarian Zapdos. Entry hazard support helps Galarian Zapdos secure easier KOes against bulkier foes and bait the opponent into activating Defiant with Defog, so teammates such as Spikes Ferrothorn and Stealth Rock Landorus-T are good choices. Ferrothorn can more easily chip away at foes with Knock Off and Leech Seed, while Landorus-T can come in on Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Zeraora that threaten Galarian Zapdos. Landorus-T can also utilize Toxic to wear down some of Galarian Zapdos's checks like Zapdos and Slowbro. Pairing Galarian Zapdos with another physical wallbreaker like Weavile or Melmetal is suggested, as together they can break through each other's checks. Both Weavile and Melmetal appreciate Galarian Zapdos's ability to deter Defog due to Defiant and blast through defensive walls like Ferrothorn and Toxapex with Brave Bird, while Galarian Zapdos appreciates Weavile removing Toxapex and Clefable's items with Knock Off and Melmetal's ability to both switch into Fairy-type attacks and spread status to bulky Flying-types like Corviknight and Zapdos. Electric-types like Tapu Koko, Magnezone, and Zeraora are excellent choices as teammates as they can bait in Landorus-T, activating Defiant on a double switch. Tapu Koko particularly appreciates Galarian Zapdos beating Ferrothorn, Landorus-T, and Galarian Slowking, while Magnezone comes with the added benefit of trapping Corviknight and Skarmory with Magnet Pull, allowing Galarian Zapdos to more freely use Brave Bird. Future Sight users like Slowbro and Galarian Slowking allow Galarian Zapdos to more easily break through physical walls like Toxapex and Corviknight. Slowbro deserves special mention for its ability to safely pivot Galarian Zapdos in with Teleport against Ferrothorn and Rillaboom.</p> "

Regenerator allows Slowking to keep itself healthy, which helps it switch into threats more easily and gives it more opportunities to use Future Sight. With its great bulk and defensive typing, Slowking is able to check threatening specially offensive Pokemon such as Heatran, Nidoking, Tapu Lele, and Latios and use them as Future Sight fodders. However, Slowking is very vulnerable to physical wallbreakers like Landorus-T and Garchomp, as its physical bulk is mediocre and doesn't allow it to tank strong hits from them. Slowking's typing and mediocre physical bulk also leave it very vulnerable to Knock Off and U-turn. This is an issue, as these moves are very frequently run and often safe to use, further limiting Slowking's utility as a defensive pivot. In addition, Toxic is worrisome, as it forces Slowking to use Slack Off more often and limits its potential to consistently switch into dangerous Pokemon such as the aforementioned Heatran, Nidoking, and Tapu Lele.</p> ",

Slack Off lets Slowking stay healthy to reliably check special wallbreakers without having to rely on Teleport or switches. Teleport is not only a solid pivoting option, but it works well in tandem with Future Sight, as Slowking can bring in a more offensive teammate safely to capitalize on the Future Sight.

Zeraora dislikes switching into Body Press, leaving it reliant on pivots to switch in, but it also forces Skarmory out and can set up on it with Bulk Up. Magnezone is of particular note, as it traps Skarmory with Magnet Pull, though it must be wary of Body Press on the switch, and faster variants of Skarmory can outspeed and KO Magnezone with Body Press if it is weakened.

Skarmory's Spikes prevents U-turn users like Dragapult and Tapu Koko from freely using them for momentum, especially when paired with Knock Off support. Skarmory can also check most of the strong physical attackers that can beat them, like Rillaboom and Landorus-T. Skarmory is especially valuable to sand teams, as it can check Pokemon that they are usually weak to like Rillaboom and Excadrill, forming a solid defensive core with either specially defensive Tyranitar or Hippowdon, the two viable sand setters.</p> "

Due to its access to Teleport, Blissey is able to form a pivoting core with partners such as Landorus-T and Corviknight. Corviknight in particular has great synergy with Blissey, as it is able to check physical wallbreakers such as Rillaboom and Landorus-T, while Blissey is able to check special attackers like Tapu Koko and Volcarona for it. Blissey is easily pressured by physical attackers such as Rillaboom, Kartana, and Landorus-T; therefore, physically defensive walls such as the aforementioned Corviknight, Zapdos, and Toxapex are good partners. In return, Blissey checks special wallbreakers such as Kyurem and Nidoking for them. Blissey is also great on more passive teams because of its ability to check the majority of special attackers. Unlike other common specially defensive walls seen on bulky offense teams like Slowking, Ferrothorn, and Heatran, Blissey is an amazing long-term check to key offensive threats like Tapu Koko and Dragapult.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Tyranitar's unique defensive typing and solid bulk under sand allow it to check prominent special attackers in the tier like Dragapult, Heatran, Tornadus-T, and Volcarona. Alternatively, Tyranitar can use its great Attack stat, amazing offensive typing, strong coverage options, and Choice Band to become a fearsome wallbreaker. Sand Stream allows Tyranitar to support sand sweepers like Excadrill, Dracozolt, and Sand Veil Garchomp. However, Tyranitar's typing leaves it vulnerable to common Pokemon in the metagame such as Landorus-T, Rillaboom, and Tapu Lele. Tyranitar's lack of reliable recovery makes it easy to wear down and hurts its ability to check Pokemon repeatedly throughout the game. Additionally, Tyranitar's low Speed leaves it susceptible to faster foes like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Rillaboom. Finally, many Pokemon that Tyranitar is supposed to check like Tornadus-T and Kyurem run super effective coverage moves to overwhelm it.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>The specially defensive set can run Ice Beam to serve as a lure to Landorus-T and Garchomp, dealing a ton of damage on the switch, but it has limited uses outside of that, and running Thunder Wave is more useful to permanently cripple Pokemon like Corviknight and Clefable. Chople Berry allows Tyranitar to survive Fighting-type moves from the likes of Tornadus-T and Kyurem and KO them back with its Rock-type STAB move or cripple them with status conditions; however, it is a single-use item and Tyranitar prefers the longevity provided by Leftovers or Heavy-Duty Boots. A Dragon Dance set with Weakness Policy alongside dual screens support could be used on hyper offense teams, as dual screens allow Tyranitar to survive strong super effective moves like Garchomp's Earthquake and Tapu Lele's Moonblast while setting up. However, it has a mediocre Speed tier even after a boost, and it is outsped by threats like Zeraora, Choice Scarf Landorus-T, and Kartana, which can revenge kill it easily after some chip damage. The Choice Band set can use an EV spread of 40 HP / 252 Atk / 48 SpD / 168 Spe to withstand a Moonblast from Choice Specs Tapu Lele while still outspeeding Azumarill and Skarmory. Choice Band Tyranitar can also use Superpower to almost OHKO Ferrothorn if rain weakens Fire Punch while also OHKOing Heatran. Nevertheless, Tyranitar doesn't have enough room for it in this set, and it is also forced out by the stat drop, which can give free turns to dangerous threats.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Offensive Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Excadrill threaten to KO Tyranitar with their strong STAB Earthquakes. They can set up Stealth Rock or boost with Swords Dance as Tyranitar is scared out. However, they are worn down quickly if they switch into Choice Band Tyranitar's attacks. Albeit uncommon, physically defensive Hippowdon can take on any Tyranitar set lacking Toxic and set up Stealth Rock or hit it with its STAB Earthquake.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Offensive Grass-types like Rillaboom and Kartana can OHKO Tyranitar with their Grass-type STAB moves. However, they dislike being paralyzed by Thunder Wave, and they don't take hits from Choice Band Tyranitar very well. Tangrowth's great bulk coupled with Regenerator allows it to switch into Tyranitar with relative ease. However, it can be crippled by Thunder Wave or Toxic from the specially defensive set. Ferrothorn can switch into the specially defensive set almost unharmed, and it can set Spikes or cripple Tyranitar with Leech Seed. However, it must be wary of Fire Punch from the Choice Band set.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Urshifu-R and Barraskewda threaten Tyranitar with their STAB attacks. Also, they can gain momentum with U-turn or Flip Turn. However, they hate being hit with Thunder Wave or Toxic. Bulky Water-types like Toxapex and Swampert can tank a hit and threaten it with a Scald burn or just pivot out.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon and Coverage: Though they must be wary of Thunder Wave, strong Fighting-types like Urshifu-R and Galarian Zapdos force out Tyranitar with their STAB moves, and they can gain momentum with U-turn as Tyranitar switches out. Pokemon that Tyranitar is supposed to check such as Tornadus-T, Kyurem, and Reuniclus usually run Fighting-type coverage to break past it.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-types such as Clefable and Tapu Fini can take on the specially defensive set fairly well, and they can chip at Tyranitar's health with their STAB moves. Nevertheless, they can't switch into Choice Band Tyranitar reliably. Offensive Fairy-types like Tapu Lele and Tapu Koko can threaten Tyranitar with their STAB moves. None of them can switch into Choice Band attacks though, as they lack the bulk to do so.</p> ",

Slowbro can deal with Ground-, Water-, and Fighting-types that plague Tyranitar, such as Landorus-T, Barraskewda, and Urshifu-R, and it can bring Tyranitar in safely via Teleport. Similarly, Slowking can check some threats that Tyranitar can't such as Tapu Lele and Clefable while providing a secondary check to Heatran.

Swampert's good defensive typing lets it switch into common special attackers such as Tapu Koko, Magnezone, Heatran, and Volcarona and use the opportunity to set Stealth Rock or generate momentum on forced switches. Swampert can offer additional utility by punishing common entry hazard removers like Mandibuzz, Rotom-W, and Zapdos with Toxic.

Gastrodon can also serve as an all-purpose wall against common special attackers like Volcarona, Nidoking, and Dracozolt. Sticky Hold lets it become a counter to most Pokemon using Knock Off and Trick to force progress, like Zeraora, pivot Tornadus-T, and Clefable. On teams lacking solid Water-resistant Pokemon, Storm Drain gives it an edge in matchups against rain teams. However, its passiveness usually relegates it to more defensive teams that can afford its loss in momentum and staying power. For example, it often invites in threatening Grass-types like Kartana and Rillaboom on a predicted Recover or Earthquake, requiring teammates to handle these polarizing offensive threats. Offensive pivots that Gastrodon checks, like Dragapult, can also gain momentum and steady chip damage on it with U-turn, making them much more difficult to check long-term. It is also incredibly vulnerable to status from some of the threats it checks, like Heatran's and Zeraora's Toxic and Dragapult's Will-O-Wisp.

Clear Smog lets Gastrodon sit on many different specially attacking setup sweepers, including Calm Mind Clefable and Volcarona. Toxic can alternatively be used for more pressure on defensive Pokemon like Tangrowth, Zapdos, and Slowking if Gastrodon's teammates can adequately handle the aforementioned sweepers. Sticky Hold gives Gastrodon the ability to keep its Heavy-Duty Boots forever, making it less vulnerable to chip damage from entry hazards and being gradually worn down by offensive pivots that it checks, such as Dragapult and Tapu Koko. Sticky Hold also lets it counter defensive Pokemon using Knock Off to force progress, like Toxapex lacking Toxic and Clefable.

  "Hippowdon": {
    "overview": "<p>Hippowdon's great bulk, solid defensive typing, and reliable recovery allow it to check prominent offensive threats such as Dragapult, Heatran, and Excadrill. Hippowdon is one of the defining components of sand balance teams due to Sand Stream and provides further support by setting up Stealth Rock and checking key threats like Dragapult and Tapu Koko. However, Hippowdon's susceptibility to being pivoted against by these Pokemon makes it easy to wear down and forces it to switch out. It also faces stiff competition as a defensive Ground-type from Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Swampert, and Gastrodon; however, Hippowdon manages to offset this due to reliable recovery in Slack Off and access to Stealth Rock. Additionally, as Hippowdon is a passive Stealth Rock setter, it is difficult to keep its entry hazards on the field against common entry hazard removers such as Corviknight, since it can only use Whirlwind or Toxic to dissuade them. Hippowdon is also vulnerable to entry hazards and status, which make it much harder to remain healthy while checking offensive threats.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Sand Force can be run instead of Sand Stream to prevent sand damage from being detrimental to Hippowdon's teammates and ensure they gain recovery from Leftovers. A physically defensive set can be used instead of the specially defensive variant to check prominent physical threats such as Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Melmetal. This physical set can often run Rocky Helmet to chip physical attackers and pivots such as Melmetal and Tapu Koko, although Hippowdon should be wary of Toxic.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Corviknight and Skarmory: Hippowdon hates facing Corviknight and Skarmory due to its inability to do anything against them, especially if Hippowdon is not carrying Whirlwind. Skarmory can then use Hippowdon to set up Spikes, while Corviknight can remove entry hazards with Defog. At best, Hippowdon can use Whirlwind against them or Earthquake as they heal with Roost, but it fails to sufficiently weaken them.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage</strong>: Hippowdon is easily worn down by status and entry hazards, which prevent it from checking Pokemon as effectively as it would like.</p> <p><strong>Ice-types</strong>: Kyurem and Weavile threaten Hippowdon with their powerful Ice-type STAB moves, although they cannot come in on a potential Earthquake or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Grass-types such as Ferrothorn, Rillaboom, and Kartana wall Hippowdon and force it out, as they easily tank Earthquake and shrug off its coverage moves. Ferrothorn can take advantage of Hippowdon to set up Spikes, while Rillaboom and Kartana can pressure Hippowdon with their STAB attacks.</p> <p><strong>Defensive Water-types: Bulky Water-types such as Slowbro and Slowking threaten Hippowdon with Scald and apply pressure with Future Sight, while Tapu Fini does not fear Earthquake, prevents status with Misty Terrain, and can remove Stealth Rock if it chooses to run Defog.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Hippowdon functions as a sturdy check to special attackers such as Dragapult, Tapu Koko, and Volcarona and provides helpful utility with Toxic and Stealth Rock to support its teammates. Toxic allows Hippowdon to punish non-Poison-immune Flying-types that attempt to remove its entry hazards, such as Zapdos and Mandibuzz, and other vulnerable walls such as Tangrowth, Slowking, and Swampert. Whirlwind is also a viable option, allowing Hippowdon to phaze foes it cannot do much against, such as Ferrothorn and Corviknight. Whirlwind can also be used to prevent Hippowdon from being used as setup fodder by setup sweepers like Clefable and Volcarona. Leftovers provides Hippowdon with passive recovery and helps alleviate pressure from offensive threats by letting it waste less turns healing with Slack Off. 8 Attack EVs ensure Hippowdon OHKOes Excadrill with Earthquake. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents residual damage from Spikes and Toxic Spikes, although the passive recovery from Leftovers is in most cases too good to pass up.</p> <p>Hippowdon's Electric immunity and access to reliable recovery give it defensive synergy with partners on more defensive teams and pivots such as Toxapex and Clefable; it helps the team from being overwhelmed by Electric-types such as Zeraora and Tapu Koko. Pressure users such as Corviknight and Moltres are great partners alongside Hippowdon, as they can wear down the PP of Defog and make it much easier for Hippowdon’s Stealth Rock to stay up long-term - they can also provide entry hazard removal so that Hippowdon doesn’t get worn down by entry hazards. Sand Rush Excadrill can utilize Hippowdon's sand to clean late-game after a Swords Dance while also providing entry hazard removal. Knock Off and status absorbers like Clefable and Reuniclus are useful if Hippowdon is being utilized on defensive teams, as they provide the team with much more longevity in the long term. Bulky Water-types such as Toxapex and Tapu Fini are greatly appreciated; Toxapex can handle Weavile and Toxic Melmetal, while Tapu Fini can prevent status from crippling Hippowdon, although this also prevents Hippowdon from using Toxic against grounded Pokemon.</p> "

  "Weavile": {
    "overview": "<p>Weavile's amazing offensive typing, powerful STAB moves in Triple Axel and Knock Off, and Speed tier cement it as one of the most versatile offensive Pokemon in the metagame, capable of performing several useful roles in wallbreaker, revenge killer, and late-game cleaner. Weavile also has some defensive use, as its resistance to Ghost and immunity to Psychic makes it a usable stopgap against Dragapult, as well as a pivot into Tapu Lele and Future Sight in a pinch for many offensive teams. Its priority Ice Shard also revenge kills even faster threats like Speed-boosted Garchomp, Hawlucha, and Dragonite. Both its Swords Dance and Choice Band sets let it sweep effortlessly even through opposing physical walls, including Corviknight, Buzzwole, and Clefable, with Swords Dance setting up on forced switches gained from its unique typing. One of Weavile's biggest drawbacks is its unreliability when using Triple Axel—although the move is extremely powerful when it hits fully, there is a sizable chance to do negligible damage or miss altogether. Weavile's multi-hit Triple Axel can also be heavily punished with contact-based effects like Corviknight's and Toxapex's Rocky Helmet, Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs, and Heatran's Flame Body. Non-Heavy-Duty Boots sets also suffer major chip damage from Stealth Rock, requiring extensive Defog support from teammates to ensure safe entry.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Weavile can run Wide Lens on Swords Dance sets to make Triple Axel almost always full power. However, the tradeoff of taking damage from entry hazards, notably losing its ability to pivot in and out freely, almost always makes Heavy-Duty Boots the superior option. Life Orb can also be used for a huge power boost, notably allowing an OHKO on Corviknight with Triple Axel after a Swords Dance boost, at the cost of most of its longevity and long-term offensive potential through Life Orb recoil and its vulnerability to entry hazards. Life Orb Weavile is most often used on hyper offense teams, aiming to wallbreak early-game while hazards are off the field.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Physical Walls: Physically defensive walls like Toxapex and Buzzwole can often switch into and force out Weavile, but they can be overwhelmed easily long-term via Knock Off, entry hazards, or Future Sight support. Physically defensive Toxapex with Haze can outlast Swords Dance Weavile while threatening a Scald burn or Toxic.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Steel-types like Skarmory, Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Heatran can situationally switch into Weavile over the course of a game, though they dislike having their items removed. Rocky Helmet Skarmory and Corviknight and Iron Barbs Ferrothorn can also harshly punish Weavile's Triple Axel. Physically defensive Magnezone can also eat one hit and OHKO back with Body Press, making it a popular option for offense teams lacking room for a more dedicated check.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Tapu Fini is one of Weavile's only real counters in the tier through its defensive typing. However, it fails to act as an adequate long-term answer, especially when switching into Weavile with entry hazards up. Physically defensive Clefable, especially when utilizing Unaware, can also switch into and take on most Weavile variants when it is healthy. Tapu Koko can switch into Knock Off or revenge kill it, although it needs a bit of prior chip damage to OHKO with Dazzling Gleam.</p> <p><strong>Adverse Contact Effects: Rocky Helmet and Iron Barbs damage from defensive Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Corviknight inflict permanent damage on Weavile and dissuade it from using its spammable contact STAB moves. Zapdos's Static and Volcarona's and Heatran's Flame Body can also be used tactically to cripple Weavile with status.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Faster revenge killers like Zeraora, Tapu Koko, and Choice Scarf Tapu Lele can survive or negate Weavile's Ice Shard and force it out with the threat of a KO. Urshifu-R and—often Choice Scarf—Tapu Fini can easily switch into Weavile's STAB moves to eat a hit and OHKO it back.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Swords Dance allows Weavile to be one of the best late-game cleaners in OU. After some prior chip damage, Weavile is able to break past its usual checks such as Clefable, Toxapex, and Corviknight and sweep through the opposing team. It can set up on forced switches from Pokemon like Galarian Slowking and Landorus-T, as well as more offensive threats like Garchomp, Hydreigon, and Choice-locked Dragapult. While Triple Axel is incredibly strong, Icicle Crash has higher cumulative accuracy and avoids contact, and its flinch chance often saves Weavile in late-game scenarios. However, Icicle Crash is significantly weaker, which is especially noticeable against Clefable, Buzzwole, and Skarmory. Weavile uses Knock Off on defensive Pokemon like Corviknight, Buzzwole, and Clefable early-game to better chip these targets down via entry hazards or pivoting teammates in preparation for an endgame with Triple Axel. It often prefers to keep Ice-resistant foes with recovery, like Toxapex, holding their item so it can do more damage when it comes time to sweep. Ice Shard revenge kills faster threats like Dragapult, Scale Shot Garchomp, and Hawlucha, and it can facilitate a late-game sweep by picking off weakened revenge killers like Tapu Koko and Zeraora. Low Kick can also serve as a way to surprise Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and other Weavile, especially useful alongside Tapu Lele, which appreciates Weavile luring these Steel-types and would otherwise block its Ice Shard with Psychic Surge. While a Jolly nature is often used on teams to outspeed and OHKO Tornadus-T, an Adamant nature can alternatively be used to make Weavile much harder to check, most notably increasing the chance to OHKO Clefable after a boost while dealing noticeably increased damage to Corviknight and Toxapex.</p> <p>Swords Dance Weavile shines on offensive teams, where it has several pivots to minimize risk when switching in and teammates to help it overwhelm common walls. Some examples of these teammates are Dragapult, Tapu Lele, and Melmetal, which are all able to target and overwhelm common Steel-type shared checks like Ferrothorn, Melmetal, and Heatran. Weavile removing these Steel-types' Leftovers lets this combination of offensive threats overwhelm them much more easily. Garchomp and Urshifu-R can help break through Clefable, Tapu Fini, and Corviknight for Weavile to easily clean up, and Heatran is an exceptional partner because it keeps Stealth Rock up while exerting pressure on all of Weavile's Fairy- and Steel-type checks. It also notably forces damage onto Tapu Fini, one of Weavile's best answers. Weavile also finds a cozy niche on typical Magnezone offense teams, where it benefits from Magnezone removing Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Corviknight, and it helps overload other Steel-types alongside other common partners like Tapu Fini and Kartana. Whirlpool Tapu Fini can function similarly to Magnezone in that it removes Toxapex and Ferrothorn while checking Urshifu-R, one of Weavile's common switch-ins.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Choice Band Weavile uses immediate wallbreaking power with extremely strong STAB moves and instant pressure to break through teams. While Triple Axel is the Ice-type STAB move of choice, Icicle Crash can be run for more reliable, but weaker, damage. Some Weavile opt to run both Triple Axel and Icicle Crash, keeping the former's power while minimizing the risk of missing and avoiding adverse contact effects when needed. Ice Shard is exceptionally good at revenge killing faster Dragon- and Flying-type threats, and it can even sweep through more offensive teams effectively in endgame scenarios. Choice Band Weavile's last moveslot depends on the team support surrounding it. Low Kick is most often used to hit Steel-types like Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Melmetal for super effective damage. Beat Up, especially when paired with teammates with high Attack, is great as an immensely strong, non-contact STAB move with great neutral coverage to easily bust through targets early-game like Rocky Helmet Corviknight and Toxapex. However, its restriction in keeping teammates alive and without status makes it less reliable than other options. Aerial Ace can occasionally snipe Buzzwole and pave the way for other physically attacking teammates. While an Adamant nature is most often used to maximize damage output, a Jolly nature can be utilized instead if a team lacks speed control.</p> <p>Choice Band Weavile's susceptibility to entry hazards makes Defoggers prime teammates. It's not uncommon to see multiple Defoggers, like Corviknight, Landorus-T, and Tornadus-T, providing constant Defog support and using U-turn to minimize the risk of Weavile switching in. One example is pivoting Weavile in on predicted switches into other Flying-types like Landorus-T and Zapdos. Slowking, Galarian Slowking, and Slowbro are also amazing partners. In addition to their safe switch-ins with Teleport, their Future Sight support can help it break through erstwhile checks like Toxapex and Buzzwole and help it overwhelm other physical walls such as Skarmory much more easily. They are also both able to switch into Heatran, Tapu Fini, and Urshifu-R, three of Weavile's notable checks. Physical attackers like Melmetal, Kartana, and Garchomp can help overwhelm common shared checks like Toxapex, Clefable, and Corviknight while boosting the power of Beat Up and appreciating Weavile revenge killing faster threats like Dragapult and Tornadus-T.</p> "

This support greatly enables many of the strongest sweepers and wallbreakers in the tier, such as Garchomp and Rillaboom. Its coverage is limited but effective, with different options to trap additional foes. However, Magnezone is held back offensively due to its low base Speed, leaving it revenge killed by the many faster Pokemon with super effective coverage. Its lack of longevity is also fairly limiting, denying it a defensive niche despite its great defensive typing. Further, Magnezone can't trap all relevant Steel-types with one set, forcing it to pick certain targets to trap.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>If paired with Tapu Koko, Choice Specs Magnezone can opt to run Rising Voltage for an Electric-type STAB move that is extremely hard to switch into. Its reliance on Electric Terrain makes it somewhat inconsistent, but the reward is worthwhile. Rising Voltage's power also lets Magnezone run Choice Scarf over Choice Specs, but Choice Scarf sets still lose a lot of wallbreaking power overall and can't outspeed Pokemon such as Dragapult, Zeraora, and Tornadus-T. Choice Specs Magnezone can potentially run Analytic as its ability for extreme power, but sacrificing Magnet Pull and Magnezone's primary niche is not recommended. Teleport is another option on the Choice Specs set to pivot on Pokemon immune to Volt Switch. This comes at the cost of a key coverage move, though, and Flash Cannon already heavily dents some Ground-types.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Magnezone's 4x weakness to Ground and lack of coverage, especially on the Body Press set, make it very hard to break past and avoid revenge killing from Ground-types. Hippowdon, Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Excadrill all greatly threaten Magnezone with their STAB moves, but they don't appreciate switching into Choice Specs Magnezone's Flash Cannon, which lessens their pressure a little bit. Swampert and Gastrodon resist both of its STAB types, making them some of the hardest Ground-types to break immediately.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: With such a low base Speed, middling special bulk, and weaknesses to common attacking types, Magnezone is fairly easy to revenge kill with Pokemon such as Dragapult, Volcarona, and Kartana, or any super effective coverage.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Walls: Galarian Slowking is one of the best walls to Magnezone, as its high Special Defense, resistance to Body Press, and strong Fire-type coverage allow it to pivot into and take on most Magnezone sets.

Its decently powerful STAB moves combined with Choice Specs and a Modest nature make it very hard to wall, as Electric-type answers without reliable recovery such as Landorus-T and Garchomp cannot switch into Flash Cannon reliably. Volt Switch is an incredible tool for Magnezone, allowing it to pivot around special walls such as Galarian Slowking, Blissey, and Ferrothorn to bring in stronger wallbreakers against them and chip them for itself later. Its Volt Switch is also very spammable because Flash Cannon deters Ground-types from switching in. Toxic is an unfavorable move to be locked into but is a great midground option against potential switch-ins like specially defensive Hippowdon and Swampert. Body Press lets Magnezone pick off Ferrothorn and Blissey after they've been chipped, and Steel Beam is a very high-risk, high-reward option that can even take down tanks such as Blissey and Galarian Slowking after they've been chipped. Magnezone is fine sacrificing itself with recoil after doing its trapping job.

Sludge Bomb hits opposing Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Tapu Bulu, but it isn't as important as the other moves on its set. Tangrowth can opt not to use an item at all to have a better matchup against Knock Off users like Swords Dance Kartana and Rillaboom, notably avoiding an OHKO from a boosted Bisharp or Crawdaunt. Protect acts as extra security for Future Sight Pokemon and is commonly seen on bulkier builds to ensure longevity during the long term.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Volcarona doesn't appreciate switching into Knock Off or a status move, but it can easily get rid of Tangrowth offensively, especially if it is a Safeguard variant, as it doesn't fear status and can burn Tangrowth for using Knock Off with Flame Body.

    "overview": "<p>Rotom-W is a premier defensive pivot in OU because of its Water typing and ability Levitate, giving it staying power against Ground-types and differentiating it from other Electric-type pivots like Tapu Koko and Zeraora. Along with its arsenal of threatening status moves, these factors make it an amazing support option for bulky offense teams, where it is able to easily grab momentum and pivot into threatening offensive teammates while heavily punishing Ground-types attempting to block its Volt Switch. It also has unique defensive utility in checking, most notably, Heatran and Tornadus-T, but also Ground-types like Excadrill and Landorus-T. However, Rotom-W lacks reliable recovery, and it is dependent on Pain Split and Leftovers to consistently pivot and check offensive threats throughout a game, letting it be easily overwhelmed by repeated hits from Pokemon like Landorus-T and Heatran. This problem worsens after a Knock Off from one of the Pokemon it most commonly checks, like Landorus-T or Tornadus-T, or when it is statused by Heatran or Excadrill. Rotom-W faces competition from Slowking as a defensive pivot because of Slowking's reliable recovery with Slack Off and Regenerator, useful guaranteed slow pivoting with Teleport, and access to Future Sight, an invaluable tool for offensive teammates. Swampert is also able to set Stealth Rock, spam its unblockable Flip Turn, and check Electric-types like Tapu Koko and Zeraora better while still checking Heatran.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rotom-W can run a Choice Scarf set with Trick to lure in and cripple common specially defensive walls like Blissey, Ferrothorn, and Galarian Slowking for its teammates while serving as a revenge killer. However, forgoing defensive investment means that it loses most of its defensive use. It also faces competition from Tapu Fini as a Choice Scarf + Trick user that has much more defensive utility, courtesy of its base stats and defensive typing, and can lure in walls like Toxapex better.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Offensive Grass-types like Rillaboom and Kartana can outspeed and OHKO Rotom-W easily if switched in safely, but direct switches let Rotom-W pivot on or cripple them. Ferrothorn and Tangrowth are pressured by Will-O-Wisp and prone to Rotom-W pivoting into a threatening wallbreaker like Heatran. However, they can easily switch into Rotom-W and punish its forced switch with Spikes, Knock Off, or Sleep Powder.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage: Rotom-W's lack of reliable recovery makes it susceptible to Knock Off and Toxic from common Pokemon it checks, like Landorus-T and Tornadus-T, removing or negating its only consistent recovery in Leftovers. Switching into U-turn from either of these Pokemon can also steadily whittle it down, especially alongside chip damage from entry hazards.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Specially defensive walls like Blissey, Ferrothorn, and Galarian Slowking can switch into Rotom-W easily, but the latter two are pressured by Will-O-Wisp, and all three can be taken advantage of with a predictive Volt Switch into a wallbreaker.</p> ",

Thunder Wave lets it cripple offensive Dragon-types like Dragapult more than a burn would while crippling walls like Clefable and Heatran. Will-O-Wisp is also common to pressure Garchomp, Tapu Koko, and Zeraora, and it can provide amazing utility against Leftovers-reliant walls like Ferrothorn. Both status moves can also deter and heavily punish switch-ins from offensive Grass-types like Rillaboom and Kartana. Pain Split and Leftovers let Rotom-W check offensive threats while pivoting through chip damage from entry hazards or status conditions for longer. 88 Speed EVs let it outspeed Adamant maximum Speed Scizor. Rotom-W can use Defog because of its unique ability to relatively safely use Defog on Heatran, one of the most threatening Stealth Rock setters in the tier, as well as other extremely common Ground-type entry hazard setters like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Hippowdon.

It gives opportunities to wallbreakers like Bisharp, Kartana, and Heatran after pivoting out on passive specially defensive walls like Blissey, Ferrothorn, and Galarian Slowking. Other defensive pivots like Landorus-T and Corviknight can help keep up momentum while respectively checking offensive Electric-types, like Tapu Koko and Zeraora, and Grass-types, like Rillaboom and Kartana, for Rotom-W. Scizor is also a fantastic partner because of its defensive synergy with Rotom-W. In addition to forming a potent momentum-based core, Scizor is a decent check to offensive Grass-type threats and can check strong wallbreakers, like Tapu Lele, that would otherwise blow back Rotom-W. Rotom-W can help check opposing Skarmory and Heatran in return. Tapu Lele and Tornadus-T enjoy Rotom-W's ability to check Heatran and force damage on Steel-types with Volt Switch or Will-O-Wisp, enabling them offensively.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Heatran cements itself as one of the best wallbreakers in the metagame. The combination of Magma Storm, Taunt, and Toxic makes Heatran almost impossible to deal with defensively, as it is able to overwhelm its checks throughout the game. Additionally, Heatran's fantastic typing allows it to check a large number of threats such as Dragapult, Tornadus-T, and Volcarona. However, its neutrality to Stealth Rock and lack of reliable recovery hurts it on the defensive end, making it lose to common Knock Off users like Ferrothorn and Rillaboom, which it can otherwise check, and leaving it unable to repeatedly take strong hits. Heatran's highly exploitable typing can be taken advantage of by Pokemon it is supposed to check such as Kyurem and Tapu Lele, as they carry coverage moves that can overwhelm it. Heatran's low Speed tier also leaves it vulnerable to faster Pokemon such as Landorus-T, Kyurem, and Tapu Lele. This is hindering to its offensive sets, as it is not able to take hits that well and can often be KOed by their coverage options.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Protect helps Heatran gain passive recovery with Leftovers and wear down opposing Pokemon with chip damage from Magma Storm. Flame Body enables Heatran to better check Rillaboom and Melmetal and discourage the use of U-turn. However, this can be bad for Heatran, as it is unable to check Volcarona well without Flash Fire. Stealth Rock alongside Lava Plume are good options for Heatran, as it is a good Stealth Rock user that is able to pressure common Defoggers like Corviknight, Zapdos, and Mandibuzz. These moves should only be used together, as they are underwhelming otherwise and leave it unable to punish Toxapex and Blissey. Magma Storm alongside Lava Plume can be a good choice, as it can cripple common switch-ins like Tyranitar and defensive Garchomp with a burn while also trapping and punishing defensive walls such as Toxapex and Blissey. Will-O-Wisp is also a good option, as it can burn switch-ins such as Tyranitar and defensive Garchomp, leaving them crippled due to their lack of reliable recovery. Heavy Slam is a good choice as well, as it pressures Pokemon like Tapu Lele, Clefable, Galarian Slowking, and Blissey. A set with Choice Specs and the moves Eruption / Solar Beam / Flamethrower/ Earth Power or Flash Cannon is decent on sun teams, as it lacks reliable switch-ins. However, this set is very vulnerable to chip damage, as it has no passive recovery with Leftovers. Furthermore, chip damage can be detrimental, as it reduces the Base Power of Eruption.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Bulky Water-types such as Slowking, Tapu Fini, and Rotom-W can switch into Magma Storm and threaten to KO Heatran. Swampert and Gastrodon can threaten to OHKO Heatran and force it out, with Swampert also being able to pivot using Flip Turn; however, both Pokemon struggle to consistently switch in due to the threat of Toxic. Offensive Water-types like Urshifu-R and Barraskewda also threaten to KO it with their strong STAB moves.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Dragon-types like defensive Garchomp, Hydreigon, and Dragonite are good checks to Heatran, as they resist Magma Storm and threaten to OHKO it. They can also shrug off any chip damage from Magma Storm using their recovery, but they should be wary of being crippled by Toxic. Dragonite is a notable check, as it can use Heal Bell to get rid of any status that Heatran dishes out. Kyurem can use Heatran as setup fodder with Substitute, and it is capable of OHKOing Heatran with a Choice Specs-boosted coverage option.</p> <p><strong>Ground-type Pokemon and Coverage: Ground-types like Landorus-T, Garchomp, Excadrill, and Nidoking can threaten to OHKO Heatran. Moreover, Pokemon such as Galarian Slowking and Tyranitar can take Heatran's hits quite well and threaten to possibly KO it with Earthquake; however, Galarian Slowking with Earthquake is rather uncommon.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Heatran's lack of reliable recovery leaves it weak to residual damage from entry hazards, Leech Seed from Ferrothorn, and Sticky Barb from Trick Clefable, and it makes it vulnerable to repeated strong hits from the likes of Tornadus-T and Dragapult. Knock Off can make this worse, as it removes Heatran's only form of recovery in Leftovers.</p> <p><strong>Fighting-type Pokemon and Coverage: Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Kartana, and Tapu Lele run Fighting-type coverage moves to deal with Heatran and Steel-types and can threaten a KO on it and force it out.

It also offers defensive utility despite its poor bulk, as it can set Stealth Rock, is one of the few viable users of Rapid Spin, and can deter Volt Switch attempts from Pokemon like Zeraora and Tapu Koko due to its Electric immunity. These traits can allow it to take on a more supportive role, utilizing its useful defensive typing and utility movepool to check Fairy-type Pokemon such as Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Clefable and either set or remove entry hazards depending on the needs of its team. Unfortunately, Excadrill is very frail, and its Speed is mediocre if not boosted by Sand Rush or Rapid Spin, making it easily revenge killed by strong priority moves from Pokemon such as Rillaboom and Urshifu-R as well as by faster Pokemon like Garchomp and Kartana.

Excadrill can use some alternative items to Leftovers. For example, Heavy-Duty Boots allows Excadrill to switch in without taking damage from entry hazards, which can be helpful if using Rapid Spin. However, Excadrill is already immune to Toxic Spikes and resistant to Stealth Rock, meaning that the chip damage is not usually significant. An Air Balloon is another item that can be used on Sand Rush variants to allow Excadrill to set up against some Ground-types like Hippowdon, Garchomp, and Landorus-T that would usually force it out, but it isn't useful otherwise, and Excadrill will be unable to take advantage of its defensive typing if it wants to keep its item intact. Additionally, Excadrill is worn down more quickly without the passive recovery of Leftovers. High Horsepower can be used over Earthquake on either set to avoid having Excadrill's strongest STAB move weakened by Grassy Terrain, although in other situations its reduced power and imperfect accuracy can be undesirable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Flying-types: Corviknight and Skarmory are the best counters to Excadrill, resisting its STAB moves and being immune to Toxic. Zapdos also resists Excadrill's STAB moves but must watch out for Rock Slide and Toxic.

Ferrothorn is almost completely useless against Regenerator cores such as Toxapex + Tangrowth and Toxapex + Tornadus-T, as they can easily shrug off Ferrothorn's chip damage and PP stall it. Furthermore, Ferrothorn is very easily worn down due to its reliance on Leech Seed and Leftovers to make up for its lack of reliable recovery, which makes it susceptible to wallbreakers such as Kartana and Rillaboom and Knock Off users such as Toxapex and Clefable that can threaten it over time.</p> ",

Alternatively, Stealth Rock can be used over Spikes if your team lacks a Stealth Rock setter; however, Ferrothorn will have a harder time breaking through defensive cores. Leech Seed is Ferrothorn's main source of recovery and is particularly helpful because it makes Ferrothorn, which is usually a passive Pokemon, much harder to switch into. Maximum HP and Defense investment allows Ferrothorn to check Weavile, Zeraora, Melmetal, and other physical attackers well.</p> <p>Ferrothorn fits on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate the defensive utility it provides as a Spikes setter. Wallbreakers such as Dragapult, Kyurem, and Nidoking appreciate the entry hazards Ferrothorn sets up and can pressure revenge killers such as Zeraora and Weavile. Clefable and Heatran both have great defensive synergy with Ferrothorn, as they can wear down common checks such as Corviknight. They, alongside other Stealth Rock setters such as Landorus-T, can also help Ferrothorn by allowing it to run Spikes. It's incredibly important to provide checks to Fire-type Pokemon such as Heatran and Volcarona, as Ferrothorn is extremely vulnerable to them. Therefore, Pokemon like Tapu Fini and Garchomp are fantastic partners for it. Fast pivots such as Tornadus-T and Tapu Koko provide VoltTurn support and retain momentum against Pokemon like Corviknight and Mandibuzz, which only fear Knock Off from Ferrothorn, while benefiting from it setting up Spikes to further pressure their defensive switch-ins like Heatran and Galarian Slowking. They can also give Ferrothorn opportunities to set up entry hazards and utilize Knock Off more reliably after pivoting against its checks such as Corviknight and Zapdos. Rain teams also deserve a special mention, as they have formidable synergy with Ferrothorn; Ferrothorn provides Spikes support to wear down the opposing team for rain wallbreakers like Kingdra, Seismitoad, and Barraskewda, it acts as a great check to many Pokemon that threaten rain teams such as Tapu Koko and Rillaboom, while rain reduces its weakness to Fire.</p> "

Foul Play also discourages physical wallbreakers like Rillaboom, Kartana, Dragapult, and Excadrill from setting up. Since it is reliant on Heavy-Duty Boots, Pokemon that it otherwise reliably checks, like Kartana and Rillaboom, can pressure it more effectively after using Knock Off.

Whirlwind can be a good choice over U-turn to stop Mandibuzz from being setup fodder against sweepers like Volcarona, Tapu Fini, and Reuniclus. Taunt is also a good option over U-turn, since it can also prevent setup and stop Pokemon from setting entry hazards on Mandibuzz; it additionally allows Mandibuzz to win PP wars even though common entry hazards like Stealth Rock and Spikes have more PP than Defog.

This is further complemented by its decent Speed allowing it to outpace common offensive Pokemon such as offensive Landorus-T, Kyurem, and Tapu Lele. On top of all this, Hydreigon's defensive typing, ability, and Roost let it check Heatran extremely effectively and come in on slower defensive Pokemon such as Toxapex and Slowking with ease. However, although Hydreigon has passable Speed, it is still outpaced and OHKOed by common Pokemon such as Dragapult, Weavile, and Tapu Koko. It will also often be checked by some Pokemon such as Fairy-types, which it struggles to break through without Flash Cannon, and Blissey, which it can't do much to without Nasty Plot boosts.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Hydreigon's movepool has options to cover certain defensive Pokemon at the cost of the neutral coverage its listed options provide; for instance, Superpower lets Hydreigon lure in Blissey and 2HKO it. Choice Scarf Hydreigon is a decent offensive pivot with U-turn and can also function as a revenge killer, but it oftentimes doesn't want to be locked into any of its attacks. Substitute improves Hydreigon's matchup versus offensive teams, as it eases prediction when forcing switches, as well as scouting Choice Scarf users such as Landorus-T. Substitute also allows Hydreigon to shield itself from status effects from Pokemon such as Toxapex. A bulkier set with Defog is a viable option to check Heatran even better, as well as other Pokemon such as Blacephalon, but it is passive and overall very niche.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Hydreigon's 4x weakness to Fairy makes Pokemon of this type solid checks to it. Clefable and Tapu Fini can survive any attack from full health and OHKO or heavily damage Hydreigon in return; however, Clefable is OHKOed by +2 Flash Cannon, and Tapu Fini can become too worn down to be able to pivot into Hydreigon's attacks. Rarer Unaware Clefable sets tend to check it better. Tapu Koko easily outspeeds Hydreigon and OHKOes it, although it can't pivot into Earth Power. The rarer Choice Scarf Tapu Fini also outpaces Hydreigon and OHKOes it.</p> <p><strong>Blissey: Blissey can tank just about any attack Hydreigon uses, up to a +4 Life Orb Draco Meteor, and cripple it with status or use Teleport to gain momentum.</p> <p><strong>Faster Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster Pokemon such as Kartana and Tornadus-T can easily outpace Hydreigon and pick it off if it is chipped a little bit. Weavile can outpace and OHKO Hydreigon, while Zeraora can also pick off a chipped Hydreigon. Common Dragon-types such as Dragapult, Sand Rush-boosted Dracozolt, and Garchomp all outpace Hydreigon.

Flash Cannon provides coverage for Clefable while still hitting Tyranitar for super effective damage. Roost is mandatory to consistently pivot into Pokemon such as the aforementioned Heatran, Toxapex, and Slowking. Draco Meteor can be used over Flash Cannon or Earth Power to heavily dent most Pokemon, better pressure Mandibuzz as well as defensive Dragonite, and OHKO Urshifu-R, although the Special Attack drop usually forces Hydreigon to switch out after. Flamethrower can also be used over either coverage move to better pressure Corviknight. Life Orb is the best item for this set, as it allows Hydreigon to OHKO Heatran as well as 2HKO Clefable and Slowking. However, if your team needs Hydreigon's defensive capabilities, Leftovers lets it stay around longer, pivot into Heatran's Magma Storm more consistently, and negate burn damage from Pokemon such as Toxapex and Slowbro.</p> <p>Grass-types such as Rillaboom and Kartana put both Ferrothorn and Corviknight in 2HKO range of Dark Pulse by using Knock Off as they switch in; in return, Hydreigon offers a consistent switch-in to Heatran, which can be especially helpful if either one of them is Choice locked into a Grass-type move. Zeraora and Dragapult, when paired with Hydreigon, can overwhelm shared checks such as Clefable and Ferrothorn. Steel-types such as Corviknight, Scizor, and Heatran can check Fairy-types and appreciate Hydreigon checking Heatran; Scizor also has the added benefit of checking Kyurem, while Heatran can help overwhelm Tyranitar and Hippowdon.

Corviknight is another U-turn pivot that can lure in Rotom-W and Toxapex for Hydreigon. Slowking and Blissey can also pivot with Teleport, and Slowking can help overwhelm foes with Future Sight in combination with Hydreigon's attacks; the two also have decent defensive synergy with Hydreigon.

Galarian Slowking can also use Future Sight to punish Steel-type switch-ins such as Corviknight and Ferrothorn. Ironically, Corviknight and Skarmory make for decent teammates, as they can check Garchomp and Kartana; Corviknight, once again, can lure in Pokemon such as Zapdos and bring in Hydreigon with U-turn, while Skarmory can provide Spikes to wear down Hydreigon's checks such as Tapu Fini.

A Choice Band set can be used to take advantage of Landorus-T's high Attack and strong coverage, although it requires a lot more prediction to pull off.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Slowbro is a great defensive answer to Landorus-T by virtue of its high Defense, which means it can take hits well and retaliate with Scald or Ice Beam, although it dislikes taking a Toxic. Other bulky Water-types such as Rotom-W and Gastrodon can usually take a hit and threaten Landorus-T with their super effective STAB moves, but they struggle against Swords Dance sets and dislike Toxic as well. Offensive Water-types like Urshifu-R, Barraskewda, and Choice Scarf Tapu Fini can easily revenge kill Landorus-T. Urshifu-R is notably good at taking down Substitute variants thanks to Surging Strikes.</p> <p><strong>Corviknight and Skarmory: Thanks to their typing and excellent defensive stats, both of these Pokemon take very little from Landorus-T's attacks and are immune to Toxic. Corviknight can clear Stealth Rock with Defog, use Brave Bird to chip away at Landorus-T, or use U-turn to pivot out into a teammate. Skarmory can set up its own entry hazards, threaten Landorus-T with Toxic, or use Iron Defense to make tanking hits easier and be one of the best counters to Swords Dance sets.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types</strong>: Tangrowth can easily wall Landorus-T due to its typing and good Defense; Ferrothorn can also take a hit from Landorus-T, although it struggles against Swords Dance variants. They can both use Knock Off or wear down Landorus-T with their STAB moves and Leech Seed. Rillaboom can revenge kill offensive Landorus-T with Grassy Glide and also summon Grassy Terrain to lower Earthquake's damage, but it dislikes switching into U-turn or Toxic from other sets.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers: Landorus-T's mediocre special bulk means it can easily be KOed by special attackers such as Tapu Lele, Dragapult, and Latios.</p> <p><strong>Ice-type Pokemon and Coverage: Ice-types such as Kyurem and Weavile can outspeed non-Choice Scarf Landorus-T and easily OHKO it. Ice-type coverage like Ice Beam from Nidoking and Galarian Slowking is also problematic for Landorus-T.</p> ",

U-turn allows it to safely pivot out against checks like Corviknight, Hippowdon, and opposing Landorus-T as well as keep up momentum during a match. Knock Off cripples any Pokemon that switches in by removing their item; this makes Landorus-T much more annoying to switch into. Removing Heavy-Duty Boots from Pokemon like Tornadus-T, Zapdos, and Mandibuzz is especially useful, as it leaves them vulnerable to Landorus-T's Stealth Rock. Toxic is an alternative that cripples Pokemon like Tangrowth, Slowbro, and opposing Landorus-T. It's also especially useful for pressuring Defoggers such as the aforementioned Tornadus-T and Mandibuzz. Leftovers provides Landorus-T with passive recovery, which somewhat mitigates its problem with longevity. 92 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Bisharp and specially defensive Heatran as well as positive-natured base 60s such as Magnezone and Aegislash.</p> <p>Slowking can switch into strong special attackers such as Tapu Lele and Latios that easily overwhelm Landorus-T. It also generally covers Landorus-T's Water and Ice weaknesses. Similarly, Slowbro can also cover these weaknesses while also alleviating some of the pressure from Landorus-T in checking physical attackers like Garchomp and Excadrill. Bulky Steel-types like Corviknight and Ferrothorn are good partners, as they can take on the aforementioned Psychic-types. Bulk Up Corviknight can also alleviate pressure against physical attackers like Garchomp, Kartana, and Rillaboom, while Ferrothorn is a good Water-resistant teammate that can form a hazard-stacking duo with Landorus-T. Furthermore, Landorus-T can cripple Bulk Up Corviknight's checks such as Zapdos and Slowbro with Knock Off or Toxic. Offensive Pokemon such as Dragapult and Choice Specs Kyurem appreciate being brought in safely by Landorus-T's U-turn, especially against switch-ins like Slowbro and Tangrowth. They also appreciate its Stealth Rock support and ability to cripple their defensive answers with Knock Off or Toxic. Weavile is another good teammate that appreciates being brought in safely by U-turn against Landorus-T's switch-ins, such as Tornadus-T and Zapdos, to get a chance to set up or freely throw out an attack.</p> "

However, Hawlucha is frail, even with the Defense boost provided by its Terrain Seed, so it can only set up on Pokemon that it can force out or take a hit from, like Kartana. It also has problems with breaking through some common walls like Toxapex, Slowbro, and Skarmory, even after a Swords Dance boost, and it can get heavily crippled by status or chip damage. Lastly, Hawlucha heavily relies on its teammates and their survival to accomplish its role, meaning it will be dead weight until late-game.</p> ",

Toxapex can reset its boosts with Haze and burn or poison it, Slowbro can eliminate it with Future Sight and Scald, Skarmory can win one-on-one, and Zapdos can paralyze it with Static and OHKO with its STAB moves, only fearing a boosted Stone Edge. Aegislash deserves a special mention, since it resists all Hawlucha's attacks and can decimate it with its own.</p> <p><strong>Status: All status ailments can severely cripple Hawlucha, as they can halve its Attack or Speed, slowly chip it down, or shut it down completely. Some of its checks, like Slowbro and Toxapex, can also cripple it with Scald burns or poison, hindering its ability to sweep.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Terrain</strong>: As Hawlucha relies on Terrains to start its sweep, Tapu Lele, Tapu Fini, Tapu Koko, and Rillaboom are roadblocks to it, as they can force Hawlucha out after switching in.

Hawlucha's item is interchangeable depending on its teammates; on hyper offense teams, Hawlucha should run Grassy Seed, while on dual screens teams Electric Seed should be the choice. The Defense boost also allows it to set up more freely against threats like Kartana and Garchomp. The given EV spread allows Hawlucha to outspeed Excadrill in sand after Unburden activates, as well as revenge killing threats like +1 Volcarona if needed. The rest of the EVs are put into Special Defense to increase chances to survive Clefable's Moonblast after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Hawlucha should always be used in tandem with Tapu Koko or Rillaboom, as their abilities activate its item and therefore Unburden. Rillaboom provides a strong wallbreaker that shares checks with Hawlucha, like Tornadus-T and Zapdos, so they can overwhelm them together. However, Tapu Koko acts as an offensive pivot that can set up screens and deal with walls like Toxapex and Slowbro, as well as bringing in Hawlucha against would-be setup fodders like Ferrothorn with U-turn. As Hawlucha only has one opportunity to clean, it appreciates having all of its checks removed or chipped into KO range; this makes Knock Off support from Kartana and Weavile very valuable, as they can remove items like Heavy-Duty Boots and Leftovers from its checks like Toxapex and Zapdos. Both Kartana and Weavile also share checks with Hawlucha; this allows them to wear them down together and let one clean late-game. They can also pressure some of Hawlucha's checks, like Slowbro and Hippowdon, with their STAB moves. Finally, Dragapult and Hawlucha can form an offensive core that can be hard to manage. Dragapult pressures key targets like Zapdos or Toxapex and forces damage on them with its powerful STAB moves; it can also offer setup opportunities with U-turn, as it gets forced out by Pokemon that Hawlucha wants to use as setup fodder, like Blissey and Tyranitar.</p> "

Thanks to these qualities, Toxapex is able to fit on numerous balance and stall teams as a defensive pivot. Its high number of utility options allow Toxapex to wear down and cripple many of the metagame's top threats such as Mandibuzz, Ferrothorn, and Heatran, making it a hard Pokemon to switch into despite being a defensive Pokemon. Toxapex unfortunately has trouble exerting offensive pressure due to its underwhelming offensive stats; therefore, its only ways of making progress will be spreading status such as poison and burn and removing items with Knock Off.</p> ",

Haze prevents Toxapex from being used as setup fodder by Pokemon like Dragonite, Calm Mind Clefable, Volcarona, and Suicune.

Heatran takes on Volcarona and Corviknight while also setting Stealth Rock. In return, Tapu Bulu checks Water-types such as Urshifu-R and Slowking while providing Terrain support. Volcarona, Heatran, and Tornadus-T can threaten Tapu Bulu, so switch-ins for them such as Slowking and defensive Dragonite can cover for it while alleviating its pressure to check Urshifu-R. The former is also able to handle faster wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele and Tornadus-T, while the latter is able to provide Tapu Bulu Heal Bell support. Tapu Koko is able to lure in targets that Tapu Bulu takes advantage of like Ferrothorn and Hippowdon and bring it in with U-turn out while providing a great check to Tornadus-T. Magnezone can remove Corviknight and Skarmory so Tapu Bulu doesn't have to force its way past them, and it benefits from Grassy Terrain decreasing the damage of Earthquake. Kartana is a great partner alongside Tapu Bulu, overwhelming teams once Tapu Bulu removes Flying-types like Zapdos, defensive Dragonite, and Mandibuzz with its powerful coverage. Grassy Terrain also complements its Leaf Blade.</p> "

  "Tapu Fini": {
    "overview": "<p>Tapu Fini is an excellent defensive presence in the OU metagame thanks to its typing and solid bulk, which allows it to check notable threats such as Weavile, Urshifu-R, Heatran, and Hydreigon. It can use Choice Scarf sets to switch into and threaten Pokemon like Urshifu-R and Dragapult, or it can take advantage of common defensive Pokemon such as Slowking, Toxapex, and Blissey by trapping and eliminating them for its teammates or setting up on them. It also limits the progress of status-spreading Pokemon, such as Dragapult and Toxapex, with Misty Surge and boasts a wide utility movepool including Defog, Taunt, and Knock Off. However, Tapu Fini lacks reliable recovery, meaning it can be worn down very quickly, especially if the common Knock Off removes its Leftovers or it runs Choice Scarf. If it has to check multiple threats, it may therefore need a secondary check to them. Many of the Pokemon it wants to switch into, such as Dragapult and Urshifu-R, carry U-turn to wear it down further. While Tapu Fini has many useful resistances, common faster offensive threats like Rillaboom, Tapu Koko, Kartana, and Zeraora exploit its typing. It faces competition from Slowbro, Slowking, and Toxapex as a defensive Water-type and Clefable as a defensive Fairy-type, which can also utilize Calm Mind sets. However, Tapu Fini differentiates itself with its unique combination of utility options, its rare and valuable ability, and it simultaneously checking Pokemon such as Heatran and Weavile.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A more defensive Choice Scarf set with Whirlpool, Moonblast, Nature's Madness, and Trick can be used to trap passive Pokemon similarly to Whirlpool sets, and it still allows Tapu Fini to outspeed and threaten many Pokemon. Such a set should use an EV spread of 252 HP / 116 SpD / 140 Spe with a Calm nature. Tapu Fini can also use a utility set with Knock Off and either Defog or Taunt, but it is usually outclassed by other Defog users like Corviknight and other Water-types like Slowking and Toxapex, which have superior longevity and, in the case of Corviknight, can better pressure most Stealth Rock setters.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Galarian Slowking: Galarian Slowking completely walls Tapu Fini and gets an almost completely free Future Sight off or hits it back with Sludge Bomb. However, it can be worn down if its Assault Vest is lost to Trick or Knock Off and doesn't like being Choice locked, though using Trick will limit Tapu Fini heavily, as it will be unable to use non-attacking moves.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Common Pokemon like Zeraora, Tapu Koko, Kartana, and Rillaboom can outspeed and deal heavy damage to non-Choice Scarf Tapu Fini, and they survive at least one attack from Choice Scarf sets.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Ferrothorn can switch into Tapu Fini and hit it hard with Power Whip or wear it down with Leech Seed, though sets lacking Power Whip can be trapped in and KOed by the Whirlpool set, and it strongly dislikes Trick. While Corviknight doesn't offensively threaten Tapu Fini and hates being burned, it can take its attacks fairly well and pivot into a revenge killer. Melmetal avoids the 2HKO from any move and can 2HKO in return with Double Iron Bash or Thunder Punch. Kartana resists Tapu Fini's STAB moves and can OHKO it with Life Orb- or Choice Band-boosted Leaf Blade, but its horrendous special bulk means Tapu Fini nearly 2HKOes it.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage: Often, the best way to beat Tapu Fini is to exploit its lack of consistent recovery with chip damage such as Future Sight from Slowbro, Slowking, and Galarian Slowking, which are often paired with Pokemon it wants to check like Urshifu-R and Weavile. Both aforementioned wallbreakers can also wear it down over time with their strong attacks. Knock Off from Pokemon like Weavile and Clefable removing its Leftovers, entry hazards, and U-turn from Dragapult, Urshifu-R, and Corviknight are also effective.</p> ",

Taunt might look like a strange choice on a Choice item set, but it prevents Toxapex and Slowking from pivoting into it freely and bulky setup sweepers like bulky Volcarona and Dragonite from setting up on it. Defog can be used instead on teams that require situational hazard control. 216 Speed EVs are used to outspeed +1 Dragonite, but the EV spread is customizable; for example, maximum defensive investment can be used if a team has another revenge killer, and Special Attack EVs can allow Tapu Fini to OHKO Pokemon like Weavile and Dragapult.</p> <p>This set fits on offensive teams that do not require Tapu Fini's full defensive utility and appreciate the role compression of a revenge killer, situational switch-in to Pokemon like Dragapult, Urshifu-R, and Weavile, and potential Defogger.

Weavile is a great option, as Toxapex and Ferrothorn are common checks to it, and it beats Grass-types and Galarian Slowking for Tapu Fini. Urshifu-R can similarly benefit from Toxapex and Slowbro being removed, and it eases prediction against teams with Ferrothorn. Volcarona and Dragonite can check Grass-types for Tapu Fini, and both can sweep much more easily with Toxapex removed. Ground-types like Landorus-T and Garchomp can switch into Electric-types for Tapu Fini and like its ability to check Weavile and Urshifu-R.

Scald is weaker than Surf, but it discourages Pokemon not protected by Misty Terrain, such as Landorus-T and Rillaboom, from switching in due to the threat of a burn. Draining Kiss is preferred over Moonblast to make Tapu Fini less easily worn down, but Moonblast can be considered for its greater immediate power. 140 Speed EVs are used to outspeed Bisharp and Timid Magnezone. The Defense EVs and Bold nature are used because Calm Mind already boosts Tapu Fini's special bulk.</p> <p>Magnezone is a great teammate for Tapu Fini because it can trap and eliminate Ferrothorn, one of the most common counters to Tapu Fini, as well as other Steel-types like Corviknight that can pivot into it when it is unboosted.

    "overview": "<p>Kartana is one of the best and most threatening wallbreakers in OU because of its monstrous Attack stat, good coverage options, and exceptional Speed tier among wallbreakers, which makes it difficult to revenge kill. Swords Dance or Choice Band lets it bust through its most common checks in Corviknight, Skarmory, and Zapdos. It can also be a good revenge killer and late-game wincon when utilizing a Choice Scarf and its ability Beast Boost. This lets it outspeed almost everything in the metagame and subsequently snowball for extremely easy sweeps. Knock Off lets it cripple common Flying- and Fire-type switch-ins, like Zapdos and Volcarona, by removing their Heavy-Duty Boots. Kartana is extremely effective at wallbreaking for other Pokemon that it shares Flying- or Grass-type checks with, including Garchomp and Rillaboom. However, it can be hindered by contact-based abilities and items like Zapdos's Static, Volcarona's Flame Body, Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs, and Corviknight's Rocky Helmet. Swords Dance and Choice Band sets are commonly revenge killed by faster threats such as Dragapult and Zeraora after they're switched in safely via a defensive pivot like Mandibuzz or Corviknight. Choice Scarf sets can be easily shut down by physically defensive walls like Tangrowth, Corviknight, and Skarmory without the power boost given by Swords Dance or Choice Band. Kartana faces competition from other wallbreakers and wincons like Garchomp, Bisharp, and Rillaboom because they are more difficult to revenge kill through their use of Speed boosting or priority. Garchomp and Bisharp can also use their good defensive typings when setting up, while Kartana is limited because of its frailty.</p> ",

However, these checks can be heavily pressured by Choice Band Kartana assisted by Future Sight because of their mediocre Special Defense.

Knock Off targets Flying-type switch-ins like Mandibuzz, Zapdos, and Tornadus-T, as well as hitting Galarian Slowking and Volcarona. By removing their items, Kartana ensures that it or one of its teammates has an easier time breaking through later.

Close Combat hits Pokemon that resist all of its other moves such as Hydreigon, Kartana, Excadrill, and Ferrothorn for super effective damage. Toxic allows Zeraora to wear down Pokemon such as the aforementioned Landorus-T and Garchomp as well as Tangrowth that can reliably switch into its STAB move. However, Toxic can be replaced with Volt Switch, which gives Zeraora the option to pivot out from an unfavorable matchup versus Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Tangrowth.</p> <p>Zeraora commonly fits best on offensive and balance teams, as its consistency with providing offensive momentum while also being able to revenge kill and clean late-game thanks to its amazing Speed and primary STAB move makes it fit onto these teams well. Pokemon such as Tornadus-T, Landorus-T, and Scizor are great teammates, as they form a potent VoltTurn core with it; the former two in particular are able to wear down Ground-types that Zeraora struggles with with Hurricane and Toxic, respectively. On the other hand, Zeraora can pivot against Grass-types to bring in Tornadus-T and Scizor and provide an Electric immunity for Tornadus-T. Pokemon that can cover Zeraora's disadvantageous matchup versus Ground-types such as Slowbro, Corviknight, and Ferrothorn while providing utility in Future Sight, slow pivoting, and Spikes respectively make for great teammates. Zeraora's ability to consistently take advantage of Pokemon such as Corviknight, Slowking, and Toxapex due to their fear of being OHKOed by its STAB move makes it a great partner for Pokemon like Rillaboom, Nidoking, and Tornadus-T that generally struggle with these foes. Pokemon that appreciate Zeraora's ability to provide offensive momentum against Grass-types via Volt Switch such as Kyurem and Tapu Lele are very useful teammates, as they can heavily threaten them out. Future Sight support from Slowking and Slowbro is very beneficial, as Ground-types will be more pressured and easily worn down.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Rillaboom's unique access to Grassy Surge and Grassy Glide makes it a deadly revenge killer in OU. Moreover, its strong coverage moves, setup in Swords Dance, and pivoting in U-turn make it a great choice for offensive teams; it can effectively wallbreak, sweep late-game, and create momentum via pivoting out on its telegraphed switch-ins, and it also provides residual healing through Grassy Terrain. Despite all of these qualities, Rillaboom is held back by the ubiquity of Grass-resistant Pokemon such as Skarmory, Zapdos, Corviknight, and especially Buzzwole, with this exacerbated by its susceptibility to adverse contact effects such as Rocky Helmet and Static. Additionally, Rillaboom faces competition from other offensive Grass-types in the tier. Tapu Bulu’s higher Defense and Fairy typing make it a more reliable check to Landorus-T, Urshifu-R, and Zeraora, while its access to Stone Edge lets it more reliably break through Flying-type switch-ins. Alternatively, Kartana’s higher Attack stat lets it more freely wallbreak early-game, and Beast Boost lets it snowball and break past would-be counters like Corviknight in the endgame. Finally, the prominence of Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, and Tapu Fini, which override Grassy Terrain, threatens both Rillaboom’s damage output and access to priority, significantly decreasing its ease in simply sweeping with Grassy Glide.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Drain Punch can be run on the Swords Dance set to provide a more sustainable offensive option versus Steel-types, though the difference in power relative to Superpower is significant. For example, at +2, Superpower is a guaranteed 2HKO on Corviknight after Stealth Rock, whereas Drain Punch has just a 33.6% chance to 2HKO. Acrobatics with no item is another option on the set to lure in and break past Buzzwole, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss, making way for teammates like Kartana and Urshifu-R; running no item is preferred over Grassy Seed, since Grassy Seed makes the presence of Acrobatics obvious. There is a noticeable loss in power from dropping Life Orb, however. A Choice Scarf set can be used on teams in need of revenge killing that isn't as reliant on Grassy Glide, and it can also snag surprise KOs on the likes of Dragapult early-game. This generally relies on surprise factor, though, and is hard to justify over Choice Scarf Kartana, which boasts Beast Boost to clean more effectively late-game.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Buzzwole: Buzzwole resists and tanks all of Rillaboom’s moves, even after a Swords Dance boost, while punishing attacking attempts with Rocky Helmet. This greatly limits Rillaboom’s ability to make progress in a game. Knock Off removing Buzzwole’s Rocky Helmet or Heavy-Duty Boots, however, can either make it easier to use physical attacks or increase the cost of Buzzwole switching in on Rillaboom, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types</strong>: Tornadus-T, Corviknight, Zapdos, Skarmory, and Mandibuzz all comfortably switch into Grassy Glide and threaten out Rillaboom with Flying-type STAB moves, Static, Rocky Helmet, Foul Play, or a mixture of the above. Crucially, they can all also punish Rillaboom switching out with Defog, which can greatly lower a team’s momentum. These Pokemon must exert caution when switching into Rillaboom at +2, though, for they all risk being 2HKOed. Moreover, Corviknight and Skarmory must be cautious of Rillaboom using U-turn to bring in Magnezone, which traps and KOes them, whereas the others severely dislike losing their Heavy-Duty Boots to Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: The likes of Corviknight, Skarmory, Heatran, Ferrothorn, Scizor, and Melmetal can discourage Grassy Glide spam and punish with options like entry hazards, U-turn, and Thunder Wave, especially against the Choice Band set. They must be wary of Superpower, however.</p> <p><strong>Contact Effects: Zapdos’s Static, Volcarona's Flame Body, and the ubiquity of Rocky Helmet all limit Rillaboom’s ability to spam attacks and threaten to wear it down over time, especially in conjunction with entry hazards and Life Orb chip damage.</p> <p><strong>Opposing Terrain: All opposing Terrain severely hinders Rillaboom by removing the 1.3x damage boost to its Grass-type moves and negating the priority effect of Grassy Glide. Tapu Lele can always come in after a KO and threaten to OHKO with any of its STAB moves, while Tapu Koko can either use U-turn to pivot out of an incoming switch-in or just KO outright with Dazzling Gleam with trivial amounts of chip damage. Both are unable to switch into Rillaboom, however.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>The immediate power of Grassy Glide means that, if it is safely brought in, Rillaboom can force plenty of switches and set up, such as against Tapu Fini or Urshifu-R. At +2, boosted by a Life Orb and Grassy Terrain, Grassy Glide is immensely powerful, capable of KOing virtually all neutral threats and even doing high damage to resistant Pokemon. Knock Off complements Grassy Glide well, punishing switch-ins by removing items such as the Heavy-Duty Boots of Flying-types. Wood Hammer can be opted for here instead; it is extremely powerful, often eliminating the need for prediction, and OHKOes the likes of Unaware Clefable, which otherwise frustrates both this set and hyper offense generally. Wood Hammer also inflicts high damage to Flying-type switch-ins, helping a common teammate in Kartana clean later in the game with Knock Off, therefore making Knock Off redundant on Rillaboom itself. Superpower OHKOes Steel-types like Heatran, Ferrothorn, and Melmetal and 2HKOes Corviknight and Skarmory even when factoring in the Attack drop. A Jolly nature allows Rillaboom to outspeed and KO Modest Kyurem, Modest Tapu Lele, and offensive Heatran while also getting the jump on Zapdos to pressure it with boosted Knock Offs or Wood Hammers.</p> <p>This set is best run on hyper offense builds that appreciate Rillaboom’s powerful priority and ability to break past defensive checks. Superpower helps soften Skarmory and Corviknight to let physical attackers like Urshifu-R and Weavile sweep later. Kartana is a notable partner; though the pair fulfill greatly redundant offensive roles, one can wallbreak for the other to sweep later, with Grassy Terrain making Kartana’s Leaf Blade spammable against even resisted switch-ins. Magnezone stands out as the single best partner for Rillaboom, punishing and discouraging predictable switches into Skarmory and Corviknight so it can more freely attack. Grassy Seed Hawlucha is a great partner for Rillaboom, giving hyper offense builds an unparalleled Speed tier and terrifying wallbreaker in one teamslot while also aiding Rillaboom’s weakness to Buzzwole. Moreover, Rillaboom is able to bust past the likes of Clefable, Slowbro, and Toxapex, setting up Hawlucha to sweep in the endgame.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Grassy Glide is the strongest priority move in the game under Grassy Terrain, capable of OHKOing common offensive threats, cementing Rillaboom as one of the tier's premier revenge killers. Knock Off hits Grass-resistant foes on the switch for high damage and crucially gets rid of items like Tornadus-T’s Heavy-Duty Boots and Corviknight’s Rocky Helmet, setting up easier wallbreaking opportunities as the game progresses. If Rillaboom is paired with Kartana, omitting Knock Off for Superpower is optimal, since Kartana is better poised to wallbreak with its own Knock Off if the opposing Flying-types' items are intact. Superpower is useful for targeting Steel-types like Melmetal, Ferrothorn, and Heatran that otherwise switch into Grassy Glide. For the final slot, U-turn is a hard-hitting pivoting tool that can bring in partners such as Magnezone, Blacephalon, and Heatran to punish the common Steel-type switch-ins Rillaboom forces. It generates momentum throughout the game, something competitors in Tapu Bulu and Kartana are unable to do. Rillaboom is also reasonably bulky and healed by Grassy Terrain, giving it opportunities to switch in and pivot out against weaker, resisted attacks like Landorus-T’s Earthquake without sacrificing its longevity too much.</p> <p>This set is most appropriate in bulky offense builds. As always, Magnezone is a standout partner as an incredible recipient of U-turn’s pivoting, heavily limiting the opponent’s ability to effectively utilize Corviknight and Skarmory. Heatran appreciates Grassy Terrain to heal and weaken Earthquakes from the likes of Galarian Slowking. It can open up Rillaboom by trapping and removing non-Shed Shell Toxapex, preventing it from scouting Rillaboom's Choice-locked move. Heatran also easily sets Stealth Rock versus nearly all of the Flying-types in the tier, which is especially useful in conjunction with Rillaboom’s Knock Off. Swords Dance Kartana greatly benefits from Grassy Terrain boosting the power of its Leaf Blade and can break through physical walls like Corviknight, setting up Rillaboom to clean with Grassy Glide in the endgame. Entry hazard support such as Stealth Rock from Landorus-T and Spikes from Skarmory helps slowly wear down the opponent's team for Grassy Glide to sweep later. Finally, Urshifu-R can capitalize on Rillaboom’s U-turns out of incoming Heatran and Melmetal. Moreover, Rillaboom has favorable matchups with all of the bulky Water-types in the tier, paving the way for it to sweep opposing teams with Surging Strikes.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Through the combination of an excellent defensive typing, fantastic bulk, and good movepool, Corviknight serves as one of the best defensive pivots in the tier, being able to check troublesome offensive threats such as Landorus-T, Rillaboom, and Weavile. Furthermore, a neutrality to Stealth Rock and the ability to switch in favorably against most entry hazard setters in the metagame, such as Landorus-T, Clefable, and Garchomp, makes Corviknight a great Defog user. Unlike Zapdos and Tornadus-T, it is not reliant on Heavy-Duty Boots, so it is effective even after being hit with Knock Off. Corviknight's best ability, Pressure, in tandem with Roost, lets it stall out moves such as hazards and weak attacks from the Pokemon it checks effectively. However, Corviknight is often forced to click Roost to stay healthy, leading to a loss of momentum. It also exhibits very little offensive pressure, often relying on one offensive moveslot to help it check foes. Opting for Body Press makes Rillaboom more difficult to deal with, while Brave Bird weakens its matchup against Kartana and Bisharp. Opponents can take advantage of this by sending out Pokemon that resist its main move, forcing Corviknight to switch. Furthermore, Corviknight is especially prone to being trapped by Magnezone, which can open up a major hole in its team.</p> ",

This set is especially effective at Pressure stalling opposing Pokemon thanks to its sturdy Substitutes. 200 Speed EVs on the Defog set allow Corviknight to outspeed maximum Speed Modest Magnezone and use U-turn to avoid getting trapped. The loss of bulk is very noticeable, however. Iron Head is also an option to deal super effective damage to Fairy-types. However, it is very weak outside of this and an inferior option overall. Taunt can be used to prevent status moves like Leech Seed from Ferrothorn and Thunder Wave from Clefable, and it can also defend the team against setup sweepers in a pinch, but it has very little use otherwise.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Strong Special Wallbreakers: Strong special attackers such as Choice Specs Kyurem and Thunderbolt Tapu Lele easily 2HKO Corviknight. Dragapult can also fish for a Special Defense drop with Shadow Ball if it gets in safely. However, Kyurem dislikes Body Press, and Dragapult and Tapu Lele take a big chunk from Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types and Electric-type Coverage: Common Pokemon such as Zeraora, Tapu Koko, and Zapdos threaten Corviknight with super effective moves. Electric-type coverage moves on Clefable, Melmetal, and Tapu Lele allow these Pokemon to break through Corviknight as well. Magnezone gets a special mention because it traps Corviknight with Magnet Pull and easily beats it, which can open up a major hole in its team.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types and Fire-type Coverage: Heatran is one of the few Stealth Rock users able to beat Corviknight and keep entry hazards on the field. Volcarona threatens Corviknight with its STAB attacks and sets up on variants lacking Brave Bird. Corviknight also invites in Victini, giving it a free turn to use one of its strong attacking moves. Fire-type coverage lets Dragapult and Garchomp break through Corviknight as well. However, Heatran takes a good chunk from Body Press and Volcarona and Dragapult dislike Brave Bird.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage: Contact punishment from Rocky Helmet and Rough Skin or Iron Barbs is problematic for Corviknight. Furthermore, if hazards are on the field and Corviknight keeps getting forced out before being able to use Defog, the repeated Stealth Rock damage makes its job of switching into Pokemon it's supposed to check more difficult.</p> ",

Maximum HP and Defense EVs is an alternative, although it takes considerably more damage from special attacks. Body Press OHKOes Bisharp and Weavile while also dealing decent damage to incoming Steel-types such as Heatran and Magnezone. U-turn is what makes Corviknight a great pivot, allowing it to keep momentum against Pokemon that switch in to it. Brave Bird is an alternative that hits Rillaboom, Urshifu-R, and Volcarona for super effective damage and prevents it from being setup fodder for the latter. However, teams especially weak to physical setup sweepers such as Swords Dance Garchomp and Kartana can make use of Iron Defense to completely wall those Pokemon while also making Body Press stronger. Corviknight's ability to wall most hazard setters makes it an excellent Defog user. Leftovers helps check more Pokemon in the long run thanks to the passive recovery. Rocky Helmet deals chip damage to U-turn and Knock Off spam and dissuades Urshifu-R from using Surging Strikes. Corviknight is often switching in on Knock Off from Pokemon such as Weavile, Bisharp, Rillaboom, and Kartana, so its item rarely lasts the entire match.</p> <p>Many team archetypes appreciate Corviknight as a Defogger thanks to its strong defensive presence and pivoting ability. Defensive teams greatly appreciate its longevity and ability to take Knock Off, while more offensive teams take great advantage of its pivoting. Corviknight appreciates Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Hippowdon switching into Electric-type attacks from Zeraora, Tapu Koko, and Zapdos that threaten it. These Pokemon also threaten Heatran, one of the few Stealth Rock setters able to beat Corviknight. Slowking, Toxapex, and Heatran switch into Fire-types that threaten Corviknight such as Heatran for the former two and Volcarona for the latter two. Slowking and Blissey also sponge special attacks from Pokemon such as Nidoking that Corviknight has trouble repeatedly taking, and they can safely pivot into it with Teleport against strong physical attackers that threaten them like Kartana, Rillaboom, and Urshifu-R. Another great teammate is Clefable, as it appreciates Corviknight's ability to take on physical attackers that threaten it like Rillaboom, Bisharp, and Kartana, while Clefable takes on Dragon-types such as Hydreigon, Dragapult, and Kyurem that threaten Corviknight. It also can heal status with Aromatherapy. Strong wallbreakers such as Tapu Lele, Urshifu-R, Bisharp, and Dragapult appreciate Corviknight's slow pivoting with U-turn getting them in safely.</p> "

It easily beats both offensive and defensive staples like Tornadus-T, Tapu Lele, Toxapex, and Corviknight. Whether it is by trapping and weakening Pokemon like Landorus-T, Ferrothorn, and Garchomp with Fire Spin or simply running coverage, Dracozolt can overcome traditional checks to Electric-types. Unfortunately, Dracozolt is reliant on sand, as it is very slow and easy to offensively pressure outside it. It has mediocre bulk and can be worn down quickly by entry hazards, especially with Life Orb. Finally, Dracozolt is reliant on prediction to nail switch-ins to Bolt Beak and utilize limited sand turns, which sometimes makes it very underwhelming.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Fire Blast can be used over Fire Spin on the Substitute set for more immediate damage against Pokemon like Ferrothorn, Excadrill, and Melmetal. However, it requires a lot of prediction to be effective, and these Pokemon are still able to pivot around Dracozolt, making Fire Spin's ability to trap them preferred. Taunt can be used on the Life Orb set to force out passive Pokemon like Ferrothorn, but Dracozolt dislikes having to give up a coverage move for it, and it should spend its sand turns attacking. High Horsepower can replace Earthquake on teams with Rillaboom so Dracozolt is not weakened by Grassy Terrain.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Ground-types: Specially defensive Ground-types like Hippowdon and Swampert are some of the very few reliable checks to Dracozolt, tanking even Life Orb-boosted Draco Meteors and OHKOing back with Earthquake. However, Swampert is chipped down quite easily. Utility Excadrill is capable of walling Dracozolt if it does not carry Earthquake, while Sand Rush Excadrill outspeeds and revenge kills Dracozolt in sand. Defensive Landorus-T can switch into Dracozolt and force it out, but switching into Draco Meteor and Fire Spin wears it down over time. Other Ground-types like Garchomp and Nidoking can fall to Dracozolt's coverage moves, but they prevent it from freely using its strongest STAB move and revenge kill it outside of sand.</p> <p><strong>Losing Sand: Dracozolt is unable to accomplish much outside of sand due to its mediocre Speed, below almost every offensive Pokemon in the tier, so you can stall out its sand turns by switching around it or using Protect users like Heatran. However, Dracozolt can overcome these strategies if it predicts correctly. Pelipper, Torkoal, and Alolan Ninetales replace sand with their own weather as well, although they cannot directly switch into Dracozolt.</p> <p><strong>Priority: Priority moves like Weavile's Ice Shard, Bisharp's Sucker Punch, and Rillaboom's Grassy Glide can finish off Dracozolt even in sand if it is weakened, which is fairly likely thanks to Substitute damage or Life Orb recoil, though Dracozolt can get past them with a Substitute up. Substitute can particularly exploit Sucker Punch, and none of these Pokemon can directly switch into Dracozolt.</p> <p><strong>Status: Although Dracozolt theoretically possesses the typing to switch into some defensive Pokemon like Slowking, Toxapex, and Zapdos, it cannot do so safely, as they can cripple it with Scald burns or Toxic. Burns weaken it, and both leave Dracozolt worn down even more quickly than usual.</p> ",

If Dracozolt has a Substitute up, it can still safely attack one time outside of sand. Fire Spin allows Dracozolt to trap passive Pokemon like Ferrothorn and especially Clefable, easing prediction, and wear down some of its checks that lack reliable recovery, like Landorus-T and Ferrothorn. 140 Special Attack EVs let Dracozolt beat defensive Landorus-T. To do this, it must hit Landorus-T on the switch with Draco Meteor, then switch out. Later in the match, the combination of Fire Spin and Draco Meteor will then be able to KO it. 184 Speed EVs allow Dracozolt to outspeed Choice Scarf Landorus-T in sand. The remaining EVs are pooled into Attack to increase Bolt Beak's damage output.

Excadrill is also common on these sand cores; it can either sweep teams with Swords Dance once Dracozolt has weakened them or cripple shared checks like Tangrowth and Landorus-T with Toxic, making them even easier to trap and eliminate. Dracozolt's ability to trap Clefable and Ferrothorn is appreciated by Pokemon like Tornadus-T and Scizor, and they can give Dracozolt free turns against many of their checks like Corviknight by using U-turn. Skarmory can set Spikes, which is particularly useful for wearing down Dracozolt's checks like Hippowdon, Ferrothorn, and Melmetal as Dracozolt forces them in, and it also checks Excadrill. Dracozolt's poor bulk gives it few opportunities to switch in safely, making Teleport users like Slowbro and Slowking useful. Future Sight from either also stops many of Dracozolt's defensive checks, like Clefable and Landorus-T, from switching into it safely. Landorus-T and Corviknight are helpful teammates to check Pokemon like Excadrill for Dracozolt, and they draw in defensive Pokemon that it beats like Skarmory and bring it in safely with U-turn against them.

More prominently, most of Dragapult's checks are highly exploitable with U-turn and can easily have progress forced against them, as they either lack reliable recovery or can be overwhelmed in the long run with entry hazard or Knock Off support. Dragapult also wields great coverage options such as Thunderbolt and Flamethrower that let it overwhelm would-be checks such as Mandibuzz, Toxapex, Tapu Fini, and Ferrothorn more reliably. However, Dragapult's lack of longevity and only serviceable bulk in spite of its solid defensive typing means that damage it sustains is permanent, leaving it susceptible to long-term pressure from status effects, chip damage from resisted hits, and entry hazards in the case of non-Heavy-Duty Boots variants. Consequently, this can lead to it being picked off by healthy Pokemon, priority, or Choice Scarf users later in the game. For these reasons, it is also incapable of utilizing its Dragon typing to provide long-term defensive utility against prominent targets like Heatran, leading to it needing pivoting support or aggressive doubles to find good opportunities to do its job. Dragapult's Special Attack stat is also only slightly above average, meaning it needs Choice Specs or status to be immediately threatening with its primary STAB attacks or Hex, respectively. Even when boosted, its damage output can be middling, making it reliant on forced switches and prior chip damage to safely damage its targets without risking damage or status against itself.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Dragapult is able to run a mixed variant of its pivot set utilizing Dragon Darts, being capable of beating Volcarona and pressuring Blissey and Tyranitar while providing reliable damage output without a Special Attack drop. However, donning a mixed variant further divvies Dragapult's middling power by forcing Attack investment and leaves it without the immediate power of Draco Meteor. Most notably, Dragapult is incapable of OHKOing a healthy Garchomp with Dragon Darts. On the other hand, Dragapult is able to take advantage of its great Attack stat and access to Dragon Dance to pierce past weakened teams. However, such a set is difficult to get value with against common Pokemon like Toxapex, Melmetal, and Corviknight, which can outlive its onslaught and dispatch it accordingly, especially against two attack variants. Substitute + Hex variants are also extremely potent at taking advantage of forced switches by easing prediction while spreading status and damage more deliberately, but the loss of U-turn and Speed investment strips Dragapult of its ability to facilitate offensive teammates and keep faster foes in check.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Special Walls: Dragapult's damage output is greatly challenged by special walls like Blissey, Toxapex, Gastrodon, Hippowdon, and Clefable. However, in spite of this, Dragapult is easily able to exploit these Pokemon with its access to U-turn, and the latter three can easily be overloaded due to their reliance on being healthy to check Dragapult; additionally, Hex variants can be troublesome to check in spite of this. Tapu Fini and Tyranitar are decent short-term checks but are not reliable in the long run due to a lack of longevity.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-type Pokemon: Clefable and Tapu Fini are immune to its Draco Meteor and possess the bulk to stomach a Shadow Ball; the latter is also impervious to status due to Misty Surge. However, they can be overwhelmed with the aid of Knock Off support, making it increasingly difficult for them to check Dragapult as the game progresses.</p> <p><strong>Dark-type Pokemon and coverage</strong>: Bisharp, Mandibuzz, and Tyranitar are common Dark-type Pokemon that resist Dragapult's most spammable option in Shadow Ball. The former, uniquely, is able to resist both of Dragapult's STAB attacks but lacks the bulk to switch into it in the long run, forcing it to rely on pivoting support to reliably keep Dragapult at bay. Mandibuzz and Tyranitar are both very vulnerable to residual damage from Dragapult's U-turn and passive damage; Mandibuzz, particularly, is extremely vulnerable to Knock Off, which can make it an inconsistent check to Dragapult as the game progresses. Knock Off is also a very frequently utilized move that Dragapult is weak to, making it more vulnerable than other offensive Pokemon to stray uses of the move and making it further reliant on pivoting support.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Dragapult's lack of longevity leaves it susceptible to residual damage from entry hazards, status, and resisted hits, which can reduce the utility of its defensive typing and limit switch-in opportunities over the course of the game.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Dragapult is very vulnerable to being revenge killed, since it is reliant on weakened foes or forced switches in order to safely do its job without risk of chip damage or status. However, priority moves from Rillaboom, Bisharp, and Weavile and Choice Scarf users like Tapu Lele, Kartana, and Landorus-T are capable of picking off Dragapult without the need of a defensive answer. Zeraora, on the other hand, is simply able to revenge kill it with Knock Off, as it barely eclipses its Speed tier.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>When equipped with a Choice Specs, Dragapult becomes a menacing wallbreaker that can easily overwhelm a majority of the metagame with its STAB Draco Meteor and Shadow Ball. In particular, Shadow Ball is an incredibly spammable, powerful option that is incredibly hard to switch into without a dedicated answer that is able to handle Dragapult's other options in the long run, like specially defensive Clefable, Toxapex, or Blissey. U-turn allows Dragapult to exploit and safely chip away at its small pool of checks to generate momentum, allowing offensive teammates to either enforce progress or safely wallbreak. Dragapult's last coverage move largely depends on the offensive core around it - Flamethrower is a highly effective coverage option that lets it apply more immediate pressure against targets like Corviknight, Scizor, and Ferrothorn. Hydro Pump allows Dragapult to further pressure Heatran and beat Hippowdon and specially defensive Landorus-T, or Thunderbolt or Thunder to instead pressure would-be checks such as Mandibuzz, Tapu Fini, and Toxapex. Thunder, notably, is capable of more reliably finishing off specially defensive Toxapex at the cost of accuracy and PP. Although a more niche option, Hex lets Dragapult overwhelm Gastrodon, Hippowdon, and Clefable when they've been statused, but it leaves Dragapult extremely reliant on teammates that can spread status. Dragapult's access to Infiltrator alongside its fantastic Speed tier makes it a great answer to offense teams, wholly disregarding dual screens and Substitute from Pokemon such as Kyurem and Landorus-T, making it the ideal choice over the more situational Clear Body.</p> <p>Dragapult's ability to pivot around Clefable, Tyranitar, and Blissey lets it pair incredibly well with offensive Pokemon that are capable of helping it break past them and remove shared checks. Urshifu-R and Melmetal are incredible examples of great U-turn recipients. The former can use its powerful STAB combination to beat Tyranitar, Hippowdon, and Blissey while helping it deal with Tapu Fini and Toxapex. Similarly, Melmetal also takes advantage of U-turn to come in against Clefable and Blissey, and its access to Toxic and Thunder Wave further reinforces Dragapult's wallbreaking potential with Hex. In return, Dragapult is capable of using its Ghost-type STAB and powerful Draco Meteor to hit or pivot against their checks like Slowbro, Tangrowth, Zapdos, and Corviknight. Additionally, Kyurem and Hydreigon can be fantastic in helping Dragapult overwhelm shared Fairy- and Steel-type checks in the form of Clefable, Ferrothorn, and Melmetal. They also appreciate Dragapult's ability to pivot against Pokemon like Toxapex, Gastrodon, and Hippowdon to find critical wallbreaking opportunities. Heatran is another U-turn recipient that is capable of trapping Toxapex, Clefable, and Blissey with Magma Storm or setting Stealth Rock. Dragapult also greatly appreciates Knock Off support in order to strip checks like Clefable and Tapu Fini of Leftovers recovery while leaving others like Mandibuzz and Blissey more vulnerable to entry hazards. Ferrothorn is a solid option that can target foes like Heatran with Knock Off to create progress for Dragapult and is also capable of setting entry hazards. Additionally, Kartana is an incredible, more offensively inclined Knock Off user that benefits from Dragapult's U-turn, easily ripping past Dragapult's checks like Gastrodon, Clefable, and Hippowdon with its high Attack, STAB attacks, and coverage. Landorus-T's access to Stealth Rock, Toxic, and Knock Off makes it capable of targeting and pressuring shared checks in the form of Mandibuzz and Tapu Fini while hitting Toxapex super effectively and providing Dragapult with both a Zeraora switch-in and pivoting support. Landorus-T also appreciates Dragapult's ability to provide it with a safe entry against Pokemon like Tyranitar and Blissey, which it can easily exploit to enforce progress with its utility.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Dragapult's access to status, U-turn, and STAB Hex makes it a potent disruptor and pivot capable of sweeping past chipped down teams. Additionally, its blistering Speed tier alongside U-turn lets it operate as a superb check to fast Pokemon on offensively inclined teams, being able to take advantage of forced switches with ease to generate momentum or force progress with status. Dragapult's choice of status condition is highly dependent on the needs of its team, as well as what it wishes to target. Thunder Wave typically is the preferred option, as it is capable of punishing and crippling most of Dragapult's checks, including Clefable and situationally Heatran while slowing down fast offensive Pokemon like Tornadus-T for its teammates. Will-O-Wisp, however, can be a great option that takes advantage of and ruins the value of physical attackers while negating Leftovers recovery of Hippowdon and Gastrodon and forcing passive damage on Mandibuzz. Dragapult's vulnerability to entry hazards as an offensive pivot makes it a great user of Heavy-Duty Boots, enabling it to more reliably generate momentum in the long term. Lastly, Infiltrator lets Dragapult wholly disregard dual screens and Substitute and more freely force damage and inflict status on hyper offense builds. Access to Infiltrator also allows Dragapult to disregard Safeguard Volcarona and reliably paralyze it.</p> <p>Dragapult's ability to check faster Pokemon and facilitate offensive teammates with its access to status, fast U-turn, and ability to invite in its exploitable checks makes it a phenomenal pick on balance teams. Likewise, it also appreciates offensive teammates that are able to help it handle its checks due to its relative lack of immediate power. For example, Urshifu-R is a superb teammate that highly appreciates Dragapult's ability to slow down or weaken fast, offensive threats such as Kartana and Tornadus-T while also being able to take heavy advantage of Dragapult checks like Tyranitar and Blissey for wallbreaking opportunities. Additionally, Urshifu-R is capable of pivoting against Pokemon like Slowbro and Tangrowth to give Dragapult more opportunities to spread status. Kartana, similarly, heavily appreciates Dragapult's ability to cripple potential checks while providing it with safe switch in against Gastrodon, Hippowdon, and Blissey. Thunder Wave also allows Kartana to outspeed otherwise faster Pokemon like Weavile, improving its cleaning potential in the long run. Access to Knock Off can also allow Kartana to enforce progress for Dragapult and leave its checks more vulnerable to entry hazards and chip damage. Garchomp is a great offensive partner that likes having checks in Corviknight and mixed Clefable dispatched by Thunder Wave, exploits Toxapex, and takes great advantage of Dragapult's pivoting abilities while helping it deal with Clefable, Hippowdon, and Gastrodon more effectively. Landorus-T is also a great partner that can utilize both Knock Off and Stealth Rock to enforce progress for Dragapult while providing a solid switch-in against Zeraora, which may attempt to revenge kill it otherwise if it has sustained any chip damage. Lastly, Dragapult's ability to compress roles with its Speed tier to offensive check fast Pokemon, status, and cleaning make it a good fit on more defensively inclined teams alongside the aforementioned Landorus-T and allies such as Clefable and Ferrothorn that are similarly able to spread item removal and set entry hazards.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Urshifu-R is a very potent wallbreaker and pivot in the OU metagame, being able to force switches and threaten common Pokemon like Corviknight, Skarmory, and Mandibuzz while pivoting on switch-ins to its STAB moves such as Toxapex, Slowbro, and Tangrowth. It can even overwhelm and take advantage of defensive cores made of bulky Water-types like Slowking and Tapu Fini with ease. It has incredibly strong priority in its STAB Choice Band-boosted Aqua Jet, making it effective at revenge killing weakened faster foes like boosted Volcarona. Its STAB moves, while strong, are resisted by common walls such as Toxapex and Slowbro, which limits it as a wallbreaker in certain matchups. However, it can gain momentum by pivoting out of these into offensive teammates like Kartana and Tapu Koko for additional pressure. Urshifu-R only uses contact moves, so Surging Strikes can cause almost 50% in self-damage against Iron Barbs and Rocky Helmet users like Toxapex and Corviknight, making them able to consistently wear it down; in addition, Static from Zapdos can be extremely limiting. Urshifu-R is reliant on Choice Band to do most of its damage, meaning that it can't utilize its Dark resistance to switch into Knock Off without heavy punishment. This also makes it heavily prediction-reliant, potentially losing momentum against walls if it uses a resisted move.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Urshifu-R can run a set of Whirlpool, Taunt, Surging Strikes, and Thunder Punch or Close Combat with Protective Pads. This lets it greatly bait in and trap checks like Toxapex, Slowbro, and Slowking but sacrifices a large amount of breaking power with the loss of a damage-boosting item. A Bulk Up sweeper set can allow it to boost without locking it into a move. Equipped with Bulk Up, Zen Headbutt or Thunder Punch alongside its dual STAB moves, and Protective Pads to ignore Rocky Helmet and Iron Barbs chip damage, it can set up against Pokemon such as Toxapex and Corviknight lacking Brave Bird. However, its lack of initial power, pivoting, and priority takes away a lot of Urshifu-R's normal strengths. A Protective Pads with four attacks set can also be used, letting Urshifu-R freely pivot with U-turn and use Surging Strikes without fear of contact effects. The power drop is massive, though, noticeably making it ineffective at breaking through Pokemon like Corviknight and Skarmory immediately, limiting it as a wallbreaker overall. Choice Scarf Urshifu-R can act as a fast revenge killer with strong STAB moves. This set comes at the cost of a lot of attacking power, though, and with Urshifu-R's general goal being to wallbreak, it is not heavily recommended.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types: Toxapex and Slowbro completely wall Choice Band sets lacking Thunder Punch, and they can easily take a Thunder Punch and pivot out if needed. Other Water-types such as Tapu Fini can also check Urshifu-R, but, as Tapu Fini lacks reliable recovery, it can't wall Urshifu-R long term.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Defensive Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss can completely wall Urshifu-R, and offensive Grass-types like Rillaboom and Kartana threaten it with an OHKO from their STAB moves while resisting Surging Strikes and Aqua Jet.</p> <p><strong>Contact Effects: Rocky Helmet, Ferrothorn's Iron Barbs, and Zapdos's Static are all extremely harmful to Urshifu-R due to its heavy use of Surging Strikes and U-turn, making it much less effective.</p> <p><strong>Fast Wallbreakers: Urshifu-R's Speed is fairly average and its special bulk and defensive typing leave much to be desired, allowing many strong wallbreakers to revenge kill it. Zeraora, Tapu Koko, Dragapult, and Tornadus-T all force it to switch out, as they easily beat it offensively.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Surging Strikes ignores Defense boosts from Pokemon such as Iron Defense Corviknight and Skarmory, as well as breaking through Substitutes and potential Focus Sashes. Aqua Jet is great for revenge killing chipped foes, especially helping in the hyper offense matchup. Frailer Pokemon such as Volcarona, Blacephalon, and Hawlucha all take good damage from Aqua Jet, with the former two being OHKOed and Hawlucha having a potential sweep stopped when chipped. U-turn lets Urshifu-R keep up momentum on defensive switch-ins and provide wallbreaking opportunities for its teammates. Choice Band allows it to 2HKO many pivots such as Slowking, Skarmory, and Corviknight. A Jolly nature allows Urshifu-R to outspeed and revenge kill Pokemon such as Tapu Lele, Kyurem, and Landorus-T. Ice Punch can be used over Aqua Jet, giving it a very hard hit on Dragon-types trying to pivot into and scout it such as Garchomp, Dragonite, and Dragapult. It also gives a decently strong hit against Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss without having the Defense drop and Pokemon immune to it.</p> <p>With Urshifu-R acting as a very strong pivot with U-turn, many powerful wallbreakers appreciate its presence. Heatran, Kartana, and Kyurem can be given free switch ins and threaten out checks to Urshifu-R such as Slowbro, Tangrowth, and Toxapex with their own powerful attacks. Heatran in particular appreciates free switch in from U-turn to fire off Magma Storm and trap foes, and, as Dragon- and Water-types commonly come into Heatran, this chips them down for Urshifu-R to break. Dragapult can invite Pokemon like Blissey and Mandibuzz that Urshifu-R can pressure, and together they can remove shared checks such as Tapu Fini, forming a terrifying wallbreaking core. Tapu Lele works as a great partner to help overwhelm common pivots like Slowking while also appreciating momentum from Urshifu-R's U-turn. With Rocky Helmet users being such a big issue for Urshifu-R, Knock Off users such as Rillaboom, Kartana, and Tornadus-T, which invite in Rocky Helmet users like Corviknight, Skarmory, and Toxapex, are greatly appreciated. Rain support provided by Pelipper powers up Surging Strikes to incredible levels and lets Aqua Jet revenge kill foes more easily. Defensive checks such as Tapu Fini, Buzzwole, and specially defensive Toxapex are much less safe switch-ins with rain up. Future Sight support from the likes of Slowking, Galarian Slowking, and Slowbro is also incredibly useful for Urshifu-R, helping it break through checks it normally can't such as Toxapex, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss. Blissey acts as a specially bulky pivot that covers for some of Urshifu-R's big weaknesses to Pokemon like Dragapult while also giving it free switch ins with Teleport to wallbreak.</p> "
