    "overview": "<p>Venusaur is a phenomenal sun sweeper in the current UU tier. Venusaur's defensive typing lets it set up on many common Pokemon like Tangrowth, Swampert, Tapu Bulu, and Rotom-W, allowing it to clean teams with its Growth boots. With moves like Giga Drain for reliable recovery, a powerful 100-Base Power and sun-boosted Weather Ball, and Sludge Bomb or Earth Power, Venusaur is able to punch holes in many teams, as with a boost it 2HKOes nearly every Pokemon in the tier barring Chansey. With a Modest nature, it outspeeds every relevant Pokemon in the tier under sun except +2 Galarian Moltres. However, Venusaur is severely limited if sun is no longer active, being outsped and KOed by plenty of Pokemon like Salamence and Azelf or used as setup bait for Pokemon like Galarian Moltres and Thundurus-T. Without a boost, Venusaur can sometimes be too weak to sweep, as common Pokemon like Rotom-H and Moltres are able to survive an unboosted hit and OHKO it back. Lastly, priority users such as Lycanroc-D and Mamoswine can pick off a weakened Venusaur.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Knock Off can be used to remove Chansey's Eviolite while also nailing Nihilego and Chandelure, but generally Venusaur benefits much more from its other moves; it can OHKO Nihilego and Chandelure with Earth Power, and after enough boosts from Growth it can damage Chansey with Giga Drain and outheal the damage done by Seismic Toss.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: If Venusaur chooses to not run Earth Power, Chandelure can stomach any of Venusaur's hits at +2 and take it out with a Fire-type attack. Rotom-H and Moltres are other Pokemon that can take an unboosted Sludge Bomb from Venusaur and KO it back with their Fire-type attacks.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Special walls such as Chansey and Umbreon can take any of Venusaur's hits and stall out sun turns, with the former using Soft-Boiled and wearing it down with Seismic Toss and the latter being able to keep itself healthy with Wish + Protect and hit Venusaur hard with Foul Play due to Growth's attack boosts. Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro and RestTalk Galarian Moltres can take a +2 hit and KO it back.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users: Zygarde-10%, Lycanroc-D, and Mamoswine can revenge kill Venusaur using their priority moves if Venusaur is worn down, which can happen due to Venusaur sometimes having to take a hit to set up Growth while also dealing with Life Orb recoil.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Growth is a powerful setup move under sun, boosting Venusaur's Special Attack by 2 stages and allowing it to 2HKO nearly all the Pokemon in the tier. It can set up on popular Pokemon such as Tangrowth, Swampert, and Tapu Bulu due to its typing, and then sweep through opposing teams. Giga Drain hits Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types like Primarina, Krookodile, and Rhyperior super effectively. Weather Ball is Venusaur's main attacking move under sun, as its Base Power becomes 100 and is boosted by the sun, KOing Steel-types that resist Giga Drain like Celesteela, Aegislash, and Jirachi. Sludge Bomb hits Pokemon that resist Giga Drain and Weather Ball like Salamence, Hydreigon, and Rotom-H while also hitting Fairy-types like Hatterene super effectively, though it will need a boost to OHKO the former two. Earth Power is an alternative option to hit Tentacruel, Chandelure, and Nihilego harder, but this leaves Venusaur susceptible to Salamence, as Giga Drain and Weather Ball are mandatory moves. Maximum investment in Special Attack and Speed ensures Venusaur is as strong and fast as possible. A Modest nature is typically used to maximize damage output while still nearly outspeeding everything under the sun, but a Timid nature can be used to outspeed +2 Galarian Moltres if needed. Life Orb is used to boost Venusaur's damage output, letting it OHKO Pokemon such as Rotom-H, Salamence, and Moltres after a boost, while a boost to Giga Drain gives Venusaur insane damage output and reliable recovery, making it an unstoppable force.</p> <p>Venusaur only fits on sun teams, so Torkoal is a mandatory partner, as it is the most reliable sun setter in the tier. It provides the team with entry hazard support and entry hazard control with Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin, respectively. Other Pokemon that take advantage of sun like Chandelure, Darmanitan, and Charizard break holes in enemy teams thanks to their powerful wallbreaking capabilities amplified by sun, allowing Venusaur to sweep much more easily. Venusaur also appreciates momentum such as Teleport from Chansey to help it get in safely as well as give it more opportunities to set up; for example Chansey can bring Venusaur in on physical attackers like Krookodile and Azumarill, which are forced out by it under sun. Hatterene can be run as a Hydreigon check and discourages entry hazards from being set so Torkoal can come in more, allowing Venusaur to sweep more easily.</p> "

However, Nidoqueen can struggle to pivot into Electric-types like Raikou and Thundurus-T that commonly carry super-effective coverage to break through it. Unfortunately, Nidoqueen's overreliance on its Life Orb leaves it susceptible to Knock Off from Pokemon it would pivot into like Nihilego. A low Speed stat gives Nidoqueen an undesirable matchup versus faster-paced teams, and although Nidoqueen sports a quality defensive typing, it is still weak to common Pokemon in the tier such as Mamoswine and Keldeo. These struggles sting a bit more because Nidoqueen has no form of reliable recovery, meaning it is worn down pretty quickly throughout a match. Lastly, Nidoqueen faces severe competition from its counterpart Nidoking, who sports better offenses and a higher speed tier, making it preferred on most teams. Still, Nidoqueen's better bulk and role compression as an entry hazard setter gives it a role on certain teams.</p> ",

Starmie is a decent teammate for Nidoqueen because it checks many Pokemon that threaten Nidoqueen, such as Keldeo. Rotom-H and Rotom-W are both Volt Switch users that can bring Nidoqueen in safely and also check Mamoswine, and the latter has the added benefit of checking Krookodile. Nidoqueen pairs well with almost any Kommo-o set, as Nidoqueen can break through Primarina and Hatterene to help it succeed.

It can hit a large portion of the tier for super effective damage, checking plenty of Pokemon like Skarmory, Primarina, Aegislash, and Tapu Bulu. Even though Nidoking is one of the most dangerous threats in the tier, its mediocre Speed tier and bulk mean it can't find many opportunities to wallbreak, mandating pivot support to get it onto the field safely. Nidoking also relies on its Life Orb to do massive damage, so it despises Knock Off from the likes of Nihilego and Mienshao. Its typing also doesn't benefit it much defensively, leaving it weak to common attacking types like Ground, Water, and Psychic from Pokemon like Excadrill, Azumarill, and Azelf. Furthermore, despite being a Ground-type, Nidoking doesn't provide a functional Electric immunity for its team, being outsped by Rotom-W, Rotom-H, and Thundurus-T and getting hit hard by their other moves. This lack of defensive utility makes it hard to justify over other Pokemon that share its Ground or Poison typing like Krookodile, Excadrill, and Nihilego.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Fire Blast is also a solid option, giving Nidoking the ability to 2HKO Celesteela and OHKO Amoonguss after Stealth Rock, but its BoltBeam coverage already deals with both either way. Superpower can be used to hit Chansey for solid damage on the switch, but it doesn't hit anything else, and doing enough damage requires either a nature change or heavy investment, which normally isn't worth it. While Nidoking's higher Attack might make a physical set worthwhile, it lacks the proper movepool, and most of its Sheer Force-boosted moves are special. Sucker Punch is an option to pick off the likes of Jirachi and Azelf as well as other revenge killers like Lycanroc-D, but forgoing coverage or added utility isn't great for Nidoking. Protect can used over Substitute to scout moves from Choice-locked foes and checks like Hydreigon and Keldeo. While you forgo the additional power from Life Orb, a Choice Scarf set is a solid revenge killer while still being an effective wallbreaker.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Thanks to Chansey's tremendously high special bulk, it is able to switch into any of Nidoking's attacks and can proceed to whittle it down with Seismic Toss, set up Stealth Rock, or recover its HP with Soft-Boiled.</p> <p><strong>Water-types</strong>: Keldeo and Rotom-W outspeed and threaten Nidoking.

Earth Power slams Steel- and Poison-types such as Jirachi, Aegislash, and Nihilego. Thunderbolt allows Nidoking to nail Water- and Flying-types like Slowking, Skarmory, Celesteela, and Gyarados. Ice Beam can be used to OHKO opposing Ground-types like Krookodile, as well as OHKOing Salamence and Noivern, while Substitute makes Nidoking much less prediction reliant, giving it free turns against foes that it forces out like Nihilego, Tangrowth, and Aegislash. Stealth Rock can be run for role compression thanks to Nidoking preventing common entry hazard removers like Excadrill and Tentacruel from switching into it. A Modest nature should be run to increase Nidoking's damage output against threats like Slowking and Mandibuzz, since it doesn't miss out on any notable Speed benchmarks. Life Orb and Sheer Force pair together to negate the health loss of Life Orb while giving an effective 70% power boost, which is a big factor behind Nidoking's power.</p> <p>Nidoking fits best on offensive teams that are able to bring it in many times to wallbreak and tear through defensive Pokemon like Amoonguss and Aegislash. As a result, pivots such as Rotom-W, Zarude, and Mienshao make for good partners. Mienshao comfortably beats Chansey, Zarude forces out Swampert, and Rotom-W lures in Tangrowth for Nidoking and OHKOes Krookodile. Chansey is also a great partner for Nidoking, providing pivot support while beating its common checks like Rotom-W and Hydreigon. Switch-ins to Psychic-, Ground-, and Water-type attacks like Jirachi, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss can be paired with Nidoking on bulkier teams. Jirachi also provides entry hazard support, allowing Nidoking to reliably KO Celesteela, and Healing Wish support to let it wallbreak even more. Tangrowth and Amoonguss are also able to handle Electric-types in the tier much better than Nidoking and can pivot into the likes of Lycanroc-D and Keldeo excellently. Late-game cleaners like the aforementioned Mienshao and Lycanroc-D are great to break through Chansey, which Nidoking struggles against.

Raikou and Rotom-W can use Volt Switch on Grass-types and offensively check Chandelure. Galarian Slowbro appreciates Mienshao and Buzzwole checking Dark-types such as Krookodile and Crawdaunt. Entry hazard removal from the likes of Salamence and Rotom-W is needed. Strong wallbreakers like Choice Band Krookodile and Buzzwole can remove Calm Mind sweepers that beat Galarian Slowbro one-on-one like Suicune.</p> "

Psyshock is useful for dealing with Keldeo and Chansey. Fire Blast is essential for hitting Steel-types like Celesteela and Aegislash. Ice Beam hits common Pokemon such as Salamence, Krookodile, and Thundurus-T, but Grass Knot is an alternative to have a better matchup against bulkier teams, as it can OHKO Quagsire and Rhyperior.

Galarian Slowbro is also useful on Sticky Web teams, where it can be slightly less reliant on Quick Claw + Quick Draw to outspeed Amoonguss and Aegislash and provide some defensive utility with its resistances and ability to absorb Toxic Spikes. Entry hazard support from Pokemon such as Krookodile can facilitate an easier sweep. Galarian Slowbro is vulnerable to Pokemon like Krookodile and Kommo-o, so other setup sweepers such as Galarian Moltres and Salamence are good partners. Rotom-W and Zarude can draw in passive Pokemon such as Chansey and Tangrowth for Galarian Slowbro. In return, Galarian Slowbro can lure Kommo-o and Tangrowth.</p> "

In addition, Chansey can withstand certain physical attacks from threats like Gyarados and Zygarde-10% and cripple them with Toxic. Chansey is also hard to wear down, since it has Soft-Boiled for HP recovery and Natural Cure to remove status ailments, allowing it to be a status sponge into the likes of Amoonguss, Slowking, and SubToxic Aegislash. It also has many utility moves such as Teleport, Thunder Wave, Aromatherapy, and Stealth Rock to support its team. However, Chansey is rather passive, as it relies on Seismic Toss and Toxic to deal damage. As a result, many Pokemon such as Galarian Slowbro, Excadrill, and Mixed Aegislash easily take advantage of Chansey. Without Teleport, Chansey is a huge momentum drain for non-stall teams. Chansey's typing provides few useful resistances, and Chansey by itself must rely on its bulk to keep threats in check. Chansey is vulnerable to every entry hazard, meaning it gets overwhelmed by them quickly. Chansey is also susceptible to Knock Off from Pokemon it would normally check like Azelf and Thundurus-T, as without Eviolite, it is harder for Chansey to keep threats like Zygarde-10% in check.</p> ",

They're also secondary checks to Mienshao and Zarude so Moltres isn't overwhelmed by them and doesn't have to constantly risk taking the former's Knock Off. Moltres can remove Steel-types such as Aegislash and Cobalion for them in return. Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth check Electric- and Water-types like Thundurus-T, Rotom-W, and Primarina for Moltres. Jungle Healing Zarude also checks Raikou and Rotom-W, and Choice Scarf variants can revenge kill them and others like Keldeo. Water-types like Keldeo appreciate Moltres dealing with Grass-types like Amoonguss for them, and in return they can pressure Rock-types like Rhyperior for it. Pokemon such as Jirachi and Zarude can form a pivoting core with U-turn Moltres, bringing Moltres in against foes like Tangrowth. If Moltres foregoes Defog, entry hazard removers like Rotom-W and Starmie can help it by keeping Stealth Rock off of the field, and they like Moltres threatening Tangrowth for them.

  "Moltres-Galar": {
    "overview": "<p>Galarian Moltres is one of the most dangerous sweepers in UU, defining hyper offense teams with its Double Dance set of Nasty Plot and Agility. Coupled with STAB attacks that provide near-perfect coverage, Galarian Moltres can be remarkably hard to stop after it sets up. This feat is not difficult thanks to Galarian Moltres's excellent bulk, allowing it to turn Pokemon like Hydreigon and Tapu Bulu into setup bait. Furthermore, Galarian Moltres can fill a defensive role by using a RestTalk set that is one of the few Pokemon capable of defeating all variations of Aegislash. These sets also can act as status absorbers to threats like Amoonguss and Chansey. However, having only base 100 Special Attack can prevent Galarian Moltres from breaking through specially bulky Pokemon such as Chansey and Nihilego, even when boosted. Galarian Moltres also requires two turns to set up if a Weakness Policy is not used or activated, which leaves it vulnerable to Taunt and status afflictions. Using RestTalk can make Galarian Moltres too passive when first entering a battle, so the set can be challenging to fit onto teams due to how often it invites wallbreakers such as Azumarill and Thundurus-T in. Lastly, despite an overall good defensive typing, Galarian Moltres is weak to common priority moves such as Lycanroc-D's Accelerock and Mamoswine's Ice Shard.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>A set consisting of Rest + Chesto Berry alongside Nasty Plot, Agility, and Fiery Wrath is useable on hyper offense teams to provide the team with a win-condition that can break stall, but this set lets in plenty of threatening Pokemon like Mienshao, Primarina, and Azumarill for free. Forgoing a STAB or boosting move for Substitute is an option on the Double Dance set to give Galarian Moltres a better matchup against offensive teams, and it can even function decently alongside Salac Berry or Petaya Berry depending on which boosting move is being used, but overall is less reliable.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Rock-types: Rock-types such as Lycanroc-D and Rhyperior pose a huge threat to Galarian Moltres; Lycanroc-D can halt a sweep with priority Accelerock, and Rhyperior can tank a hit and KO Galarian Moltres with Stone Edge. Nihilego and Diancie also serve as great checks, as the former can take any boosted attack and retaliate with a Rock-type STAB attack, while the latter flat out counters Moltres.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Azumarill and Primarina are capable of OHKOing either Galarian Moltres set. Bulkier variants of Primarina can take boosted Hurricane to boot. Diancie can hit Moltres hard with Diamond Storm and shrug off any attack Galarian Moltres tries to hit it with.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers</strong>: Faster threats like Thundurus-T and Life Orb Mienshao can heavily dent or KO Galarian Moltres, especially if it has taken Stealth Rock chip.

The only attacks needed here are STAB attacks Fiery Wrath and Hurricane, as the only UU-relevant Pokemon they miss out on is Diancie. Fiery Wrath's flinch chance also can give Galarian Moltres chances to break through bulkier Pokemon that can tank its attacks such as Chansey and Celesteela. Air Slash is an option over Hurricane if accuracy concerns arise. Weakness Policy is the optimal item for this set, as the most effective way to take down Galarian Moltres is a super effective attack, meaning it activates a decent amount of the time and gives Galarian Moltres exceptional power when coupled with Nasty Plot. Using Weakness Policy can also create opportunities for Galarian Moltres to set up in one turn by using Agility as a super effective attack hits it. Sitrus Berry can allow Galarian Moltres to regain its health and activate Berserk for a second time. Heavy-Duty Boots is also a viable item choice, as preventing Stealth Rock damage can make it much more challenging for an opponent to take down Galarian Moltres.</p> <p>Double Dance Galarian Moltres fits primarily on hyper offense teams, though it also works on some balance teams as a late-game win condition. Stealth Rock setters like Excadrill can help rack up chip damage on Pokemon that check Galarian Moltres such as Diancie. It also provides an Electric-type immunity and Rapid Spin, keeping Galarian Moltres from getting chipped by Stealth Rock. Physical sweepers like Gyarados, Belly Drum Azumarill, and Swords Dance Aegislash fit well on hyper offense teams and can break through or soften up specially bulky Pokemon able to halt a Galarian Moltres sweep such as Chansey and Nihilego. Galarian Moltres can beat Grass-types like Amoonguss and Zarude that trouble these Pokemon in return. Grimmsnarl can provide dual screens support to give Galarian Moltres an easier time setting up as it becomes exceptionally difficult to take down behind screens. Pivots like Mienshao can bring Galarian Moltres in to safely set up against physical walls like Tangrowth and Skarmory. It can also beat Chansey for it.</p> "

Hurricane is preferable on Galarian Moltres, as it prevents it giving free switches to a range of potent offensive threats such as Keldeo, Primarina, and Conkeldurr. Nasty Plot is an option over Hurricane, as it provides the necessary power to overwhelm Pokemon like Calm Mind Galarian Slowbro. Rest and Sleep Talk allow Galarian Moltres to effectively check foes like Aegislash, absorb status, and lets it accumulate Berserk boosts. The Speed EVs let Galarian Moltres outspeed Aegislash, while the rest of the EVs with a Calm nature go towards special bulk to help Galarian Moltres against special attackers such as Aegislash and special Salamence. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Galarian Moltres from taking Stealth Rock damage, easing the need for it to use Rest often.</p> <p>This set can be challenging to fit onto teams because it has a very unique role and is vulnerable to powerful wallbreakers such as Primarina and Azumarill.

Azumarill is a helpful partner to this set, as it is able to break through just about any special wall that can threaten Galarian Moltres, particularly Rhyperior and Diancie. Galarian Moltres can help Azumarill by providing an ideal matchup against Amoonguss and Tangrowth. Assault Vest Tangrowth can help check Electric-types like Thundurus-T that can take advantage of Galarian Moltres, especially after using Rest. Skarmory is a great partner that can help check foes like Lycanroc-D and Conkeldurr as well as act as a better Knock Off absorber against the likes of Krookodile. In return, Galarian Moltres can check Pokemon like Amoonguss and Aegislash that limit Skarmory. Diancie can provide Heal Bell support to wake Galarian Moltres up after it has used Rest. Steel-types like Jirachi and Aegislash are extremely important partners, checking one of Galarian Moltres's biggest checks in Nihilego. Jirachi can also provide Wish support so that Galarian Moltres doesn't have to use Rest as often, while Aegislash can threaten Chansey.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Azumarill is an offensive powerhouse and effective wallbreaker when equipped with a Choice Band due to Huge Power, being able to nearly 2HKO the entire tier with the right move. It can also utilize a Belly Drum set to be a scary late-game cleaner. Water / Fairy is a great offensive typing, allowing Azumarill to beat key threats like Excadrill and Hydreigon. Access to great coverage moves such as Knock Off and Ice Punch lets Azumarill break past Pokemon like Volcanion and Amoonguss that would otherwise check it by resisting its STAB combination, while access to Aqua Jet allows it to also be a great revenge killer, especially against top threats like Lycanroc-D and Azelf that have taken chip damage. Azumarill also has decent natural bulk and a great defensive typing, which allows it to blanket check some of the more dangerous threats in the metagame such as Kommo-o and Salamence. Unfortunately, Azumarill is quite slow, so it is easily forced out by faster Pokemon such as Jirachi and Thundurus-T when it is not boosted with Belly Drum. Additionally, Rotom-W and faster Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Zarude can revenge kill Belly Drum Azumarill, as they can stomach a +6 Aqua Jet. Belly Drum Azumarill is restricted to only getting one setup opportunity, which usually forces it to be preserved until late-game. Azumarill faces competition from Primarina as it offers more defensive utility with its bulk.</p> ",

Azumarill can run a trapping set with Sap Sipper and Whirlpool, Perish Song, and Protect. This can trap passive foes like Celesteela as well as Grass-types like Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth, but the effectiveness of this set is purely restricted to punishing walls and is deadweight against a majority of the offensive threats in UU.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Faster Grass-types like Zarude and Venusaur are the biggest threats to Azumarill because even a Belly Drum Azumarill cannot OHKO them with Aqua Jet and they OHKO back.

Aqua Jet becomes a very powerful STAB priority move when bolstered by Huge Power and a Choice Band, allowing it to OHKO Nihilego and revenge kill Thundurus-T and Rotom-H after they have taken sufficient chip damage. Ice Punch allows Azumarill to break through Amoonguss by hitting it hard enough to 2HKO on the switch. Knock Off can be used to burden anything that switches in, such as Tangrowth and Tentacruel, by removing their item. A Choice Band allows Azumarill to maximize the wallbreaking potential its STAB attacks have to offer. Adamant is the preferred nature to make it as strong as possible, notably 2HKOing Skarmory with Liquidation after Stealth Rock.</p> <p>Choice Band Azumarill fits best on bulky offense teams. It wants to be brought in as often as possible early-game to wallbreak, so having good pivots such as Mienshao and Jirachi is extremely useful. Azumarill wants to fire off its STAB moves frequently, but it struggles to do so against bulky Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss. Nidoking, Moltres, and Salamence can remove these Pokemon and make Azumarill's job easier. Hydreigon can offensively pressure Grass-types and can also check Volcanion. Keeping entry hazards up is important to ease Azumarill's ability to break through Tangrowth and Skarmory, so partners such as Excadrill and Nihilego are essential. Tapu Bulu and Zarude threaten to revenge kill Azumarill, as they are faster and resist Aqua Jet, so partners like Salamence and Amoonguss that can comfortably switch into them are ideal.

A boosted Knock Off will OHKO Amoonguss and defensive Celesteela. Sitrus Berry allows Azumarill to set up more reliably and puts it at a comfortable amount of HP after a Belly Drum. Adamant is the preferred nature to guarantee an OHKO on Amoonguss with Knock Off.</p> <p>Belly Drum Azumarill fits best on hyper offense teams due to its nature as a late-game cleaner and need for dedicated support.

Krookodile and Excadrill are good options for this, and they also provide an Electric immunity. A teammate that can pivot, such as Cobalion or Mienshao, can help Azumarill come in safely to set up a Belly Drum and also chip foes while doing so. Once Azumarill is boosted with Belly Drum, it typically will not get another chance to do so. As such, before it can come in and sweep, it needs teammates to help eliminate its main threats, which are mostly Pokemon that resist Water, are faster, and can KO it. Good offensive teammates include Salamence and Aegislash to help take out foes like Zarude and Keldeo.

Umbreon also struggles versus some of the stronger special attackers in the tier like Thundurus-T and Meteor Beam Nihilego, and chip damage can bring it into 2HKO range of Pokemon it checks like Mamoswine and Nidoking.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Heal Bell is an option that lets Umbreon clear status from itself and its teammates, making its matchup versus Pokemon like specially defensive Aegislash better. Dropping Toxic for it, however, makes Umbreon noticeably more passive and invites offensive Pokemon in, giving it far fewer opportunities to safely pass Wish. Therefore, it should only be used on teams with absolutely no better options against status. Moonlight may seem appealing at first glance to give Umbreon one-turn recovery, but its low PP causes issues long term. Also, the lack of Protect lowers Umbreon's flexibility; it can't use Wish and have the option to reliably self-heal instead of passing it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types: Fighting-types like Cobalion, Heracross, and Conkeldurr are some of the biggest threats to Umbreon. Conkeldurr can be deterred by Umbreon stalling for burn damage, but Drain Punch variants can easily regain their HP versus Umbreon's teammates, forming a long-term threat. Cobalion's Toxic immunity and ability in Justified let it safely switch into Umbreon, although variants lacking Swords Dance cannot break through Umbreon without a Justified boost.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Defensive Primarina variants can easily wall Umbreon and sponge Toxic while pressuring its teammates. For non-defensive sets, Umbreon can outspeed and poison Substitute + Calm Mind variants or scout Choice Specs variants, but the former sets up for free if not immediately poisoned, and the latter poses a serious threat to Umbreon's teammates. Hatterene can easily set up on Umbreon, bouncing back Toxic. While Togekiss cannot beat Umbreon without Heal Bell due to Inner Focus, Heal Bell + Nasty Plot variants can set up provided they have enough Heal Bell PP remaining.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Crawdaunt is a huge threat to Umbreon thanks to its cosmic damage output and resistance to Foul Play. Zarude's resistance to Foul Play and ability to sponge Toxic with Jungle Healing make it a great pivot into Umbreon; however, it cannot easily beat Umbreon itself unless Umbreon has wasted a lot of PP, and Zarude must be careful to not waste too much Jungle Healing PP if it needs check a teammate like Substitute + Toxic Aegislash. Galarian Moltres completely walls Umbreon and can potentially set up on it; RestTalk sets in particular can do this with complete impunity.</p> <p><strong>Chip Damage: Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Nidoking can easily get the edge versus Umbreon if it has been chipped by entry hazards, lost its Leftovers to Knock Off from a Pokemon like Nihilego or Mamoswine itself, or statused.

A specially defensive set makes it much easier for Slowking to deal with threats such as Primarina and Nihilego and more difficult for foes like Aegislash and Thundurus-T to force it out; this set typically runs Psyshock over Psychic or Future Sight. Psyshock can be used over Psychic or Future Sight to prevent Slowking from becoming setup fodder for Calm Mind + Substitute Primarina and Meteor Beam Nihilego, though it makes Slowking more vulnerable to Conkeldurr. Thunder Wave cripples common answers such as Hydreigon; however, running it instead of Psyshock leaves Slowking walled by foes such as Calm Mind Keldeo and Calm Mind Primarina. Running Thunder Wave over Teleport is also fine, as long as the team has enough pivot support. This can open some doors for teammates like Conkeldurr and Calm Mind Jirachi, as Conkeldurr is faster than paralyzed Hydreigon and Zarude, and Jirachi outspeeds revenge killers such as Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Choice Scarf Zarude if they are paralyzed. A Trick Room + Teleport Slowking set can be used as a teammate for slow wallbreaking Pokemon like Alolan Marowak and Conkeldurr on semi-Trick Room teams.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Dark-types such as Zarude and Hydreigon wall Slowking due to their Psychic immunity and Scald resistance. Zarude is an especially good answer to Slowking, as it can heal off Scald burns via Jungle Healing. Galarian Moltres can use Slowking as setup fodder and OHKO it with +2 Fiery Wrath.</p> <p><strong>Grass-types: Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth threaten Slowking immensely with their supereffective attacks. In particular, Tapu Bulu can OHKO Slowking or use it as setup fodder, but it should be wary of Scald. Amoonguss threatens Slowking with Spore and Sludge Bomb poisons, but it can be worn down by Psychic if it is not running Synthesis.</p> <p><strong>Wallbreakers: Wallbreakers such as Swords Dance Aegislash are able to muscle through Slowking using their boosts. Foes such as Conkeldurr can break through Slowking, even without boosts.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong>:Status forces Slowking to use Slack Off more often. Chansey is difficult for Slowking to overcome, as it can cripple Slowking with Toxic and shrug off Scald burns with Natural Cure. Slowking is also vulnerable to status from Pokemon it checks, such as Toxic poison from Excadrill and Skarmory, Sludge Bomb poisons from Nihilego, and Scald burns from Primarina.</p> ",

Additionally, Psychic discourages Conkeldurr from staying in to use Knock Off. Future Sight can be used instead to support Slowking's wallbreaking teammates. In addition to being an excellent pivot move, Teleport works well with Future Sight to bring in an offensive teammate such as Conkeldurr to capitalize on Future Sight absorbers, which are mainly Dark-types. Colbur Berry allows Slowking to avoid an OHKO from Conkeldurr's Knock Off, improve its matchup against Mamoswine, and give it the ability to pivot against Hydreigon with Teleport. 0 Speed IVs let Slowking underspeed opposing Slowking and gain momentum with a slower Teleport. 16 Special Defense EVs with a Sassy nature improve Slowking's matchup against foes such as Primarina and Moltres; however, it should be noted that this worsens Slowking's matchup against Excadrill.</p> <p>Slowking fits best on bulky offense, VoltTurn, and balance teams that appreciate its ability to tank special attacks and pivot in strong wallbreakers. Frail wallbreakers such as Zygarde-10%, and Thundurus-T appreciate Slowking's ability to safely pivot them onto the field via Teleport. These teammates also enjoy Future Sight pressuring Amoonguss and Nihilego. Slowking forms an excellent defensive core with Grass-types such as Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Tapu Bulu, which appreciate its ability to switch into Fire-type attacks and check Poison-types such as Tentacruel. In return, they can come in on the Grass- and Electric-types like Tapu Bulu, Zarude, and Thundurus-T. Slowking forms a strong pivot core with Moltres, with Moltres pressuring Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu and Slowking checking foes such as Keldeo. Slowking struggles against Ghost-types such as Aegislash and Chandelure and values teammates that threaten them, such as Hydreigon and Mandibuzz. Slowking appreciates entry hazard control from teammates such as Excadrill, Mandibuzz, and Rotom-H. Skarmory is also a good teammate for Slowking, as it checks Zarude easily and helps against Mamoswine, Conkeldurr, and Azumarill. Its Whirlwind also synergizes with Future Sight, heavily damaging shared checks like Thundurus-T or outright KOing Fighting-types. Slowking enjoys cleric support from Pokemon like Galarian Weezing to deal with status.</p> "

After a boost, it is able to survive moves such as Shadow Ball from Choice Specs Aegislash and stomach attacks such as Nidoking's Thunderbolt and Salamence’s Hurricane. Scald helps Slowking threaten switch-ins such as Tapu Bulu and Hydreigon with burns, especially the former. Psyshock helps against Chansey, opposing Slowking, Calm Mind Primarina, and Galarian Slowbro. Colbur Berry improves Slowking's matchup against Conkeldurr and Krookodile, though it still has watch out for Facade from the former if it's below 66% HP.</p> <p>Calm Mind Slowking fits best on balance, semi-stall, and stall teams as a wincon that maintains crucial defensive utility against Pokemon such as Mamoswine and Azelf. Nihilego and Chansey are useful Stealth Rock setters that check Thundurus-T and Hydreigon. Nihilego is more offensively potent and provides Knock Off support to cripple Aegislash, whereas Chansey has more longevity and can also provide cleric support instead of setting Stealth Rock. However, while teams using Calm Mind Slowking want cleric support, keeping Slowking burned helps it set up in front of Chansey and Swampert without fear of Toxic. Quagsire provides an Electric immunity and checks Pokemon like Swords Dance Aegislash and Belly Drum Azumarill. Its Haze support also alleviates Slowking's matchup against Calm Mind Reuniclus. Defensive Salamence and Skarmory are great assets for their ability to answer Grass-types like Zarude and Tapu Bulu while providing Defog support. They also ensure that Slowking does not get overwhelmed by foes such as Conkeldurr and Swords Dance Excadrill. Umbreon provides additional insurance against Mamoswine and Energy Ball Azelf while having the option to provide Wish support. It also enjoys Slowking's ability to set up on threats such as Cobalion and Keldeo. Calm Mind Slowking can have problems against Teleport Slowking, which can bring in Pokemon that threaten it such as Hydreigon. As such, SubTox Aegislash is amazing for its ability to pressure Slowking and wear down Hydreigon with Toxic while forcing Zarude to waste Jungle Healing's PP.</p> "

Skarmory has a bevy of utility moves. Spikes wears down defensive threats like Aegislash and Chansey for its team, and Skarmory can set Spikes easily thanks to it beating UU's most common entry hazard remover in Excadrill. Furthermore, Whirlwind prevents Pokemon like Dragon Dance Gyarados and Swords Dance Aegislash from setting up. Skarmory can even run Defog on stall teams thanks to its great matchup against entry hazard setters like Excadrill and Roserade. These traits, in addition to its synergy with top defensive picks like Amoonguss, Slowking, and Chansey, allow Skarmory to fit on a wide range of archetypes ranging from bulky offense to stall. However, Skarmory has an extremely vulnerable Special Defense stat, making it a Steel-type that can't check specially offensive Fairy- and Psychic-types like Hatterene, so it faces competition from other Steel-types like Celesteela and Aegislash. Common threats like Thundurus-T, Rotom-W, and Moltres also limit Skarmory's consistency due to its passivity. Skarmory also often struggles to fit all the moves it likes at once. For example, it becomes much more vulnerable to Conkeldurr and Azumarill without Brave Bird, but it struggles to pressure Mamoswine without Body Press.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Skarmory can compress both Spikes and Defog on more defensive teams, acting as an emergency Defog option and opening up moveslots for other teammates. Skarmory can replace its attacking moveslot to fit both, or even other combinations of utility moves. It is still able to beat Excadrill as long as it keeps Rocky Helmet. However, these sets are very team specific. Skarmory can also run an Iron Defense + Body Press set to act as a wincon that is extremely tough to KO physically on semi-stall teams, even taking on Belly Drum Azumarill if it gets off an Iron Defense as Azumarill sets up. However, this set is very inconsistent, as it relies on special attackers being removed to boost up. Skarmory can attempt to compress entry hazards by running both Spikes and Stealth Rock, but it struggles to fit Stealth Rock over more valuable options like Whirlwind or Toxic and pairs well with Stealth Rock setters like Nihilego anyway.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Electric-types: Common Electric-types like Thundurus-T, Rotom-W, and Rotom-H all are unbothered by Skarmory and can use it to gain momentum with Volt Switch. Thundurus-T can also boost with Nasty Plot as it forces Skarmory out.</p> <p><strong>Fire-type Pokemon and Coverage: Fire-types like Chandelure and Moltres come in easily on Skarmory and force it out. Skarmory must also be wary of Pokemon like Celesteela, Salamence, and Azelf due to them commonly running Fire-type coverage.</p> <p><strong>Strong Special Attackers: Powerful special attackers like Aegislash, Primarina, and Hydreigon can all break through Skarmory due to its poor special bulk.

It also keeps Hydreigon from coming in freely. Alternatively, Brave Bird lets Skarmory hit Conkeldurr, Tapu Bulu, and Roserade super effectively and deal solid damage to Azumarill and Gyarados. Spikes wears down common defensive Pokemon like Chansey, Amoonguss, and Aegislash. Skarmory has plenty of opportunities to set Spikes up against Pokemon that typically cannot threaten it, like Jirachi and Tangrowth. Whirlwind synergizes well with Spikes, forcing chip damage on switch-ins like Aegislash. It also prevents setup sweepers like Gyarados and Belly Drum Azumarill from setting up. Alternatively, Toxic cripples setup sweepers like Galarian Moltres and Thundurus-T, which typically have free entry on it, and hinders Defoggers like Salamence and Mandibuzz from removing Spikes in the long run. Skarmory can run Defog on stall teams thanks to its ability to handle entry hazard setters like Roserade, Excadrill, and Swampert. Rocky Helmet allows Skarmory to punish pivoting attempts from Swampert, Jirachi, and Zarude, prevent Excadrill from freely using Rapid Spin, and wear down threats like Azumarill, Krookodile, and Gyarados quickly. The given Speed EVs allow Skarmory to outspeed Azumarill and Conkeldurr.</p> <p>Skarmory best fits on bulky offense, balance, and stall teams that appreciate its Spikes support and walling capabilities. Chansey makes an excellent partner for Skarmory, taking on dangerous special attackers like Hydreigon, Moltres, and Thundurus-T, while Skarmory handles physical attackers like Excadrill and Diggersby. Slowking similarly checks Moltres and special Salamence, and it also acts as a secondary check to Conkeldurr and Mamoswine with Colbur Berry. Additionally, its Future Sight alongside Skarmory's Whirlwind can hinder offensive Pokemon like Thundurus-T. Stealth Rock setters like Diancie, Nihilego, and Excadrill form great entry-hazard stacking cores with Skarmory. Diancie beats Hydreigon, Moltres, and Thundurus-T; Nihilego also beats the aforementioned threats and can hinder Aegislash with Knock Off; and Excadrill can pressure Aegislash and Hatterene and remove opposing entry hazards without compromising Skarmory's own Spikes. Bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tangrowth make good secondary checks to Tapu Bulu and Conkeldurr so Skarmory doesn't get overwhelmed checking them. They also can absorb Knock Off for the team, allowing Skarmory to preserve Rocky Helmet and chip down Jirachi. Zarude and the aformentioned Grass-types can help take on strong Electric- and Water-types like Rotom-W and Primarina as well. Powerful wallbreakers like Aegislash, Thundurus-T, and Choice Specs Primarina all appreciate Skarmory's Spikes wearing down checks like Tangrowth and Chansey. On stall teams, Quagsire can provide an Electric immunity to block Volt Switch and check Thundurus-T. It also can handle setup sweepers that can bypass Skarmory like Belly Drum Azumarill and Swords Dance Aegislash. Umbreon acts as a primary check to Dragon Dance Salamence and Gyarados, secondary check to Mamoswine, and way to beat Chandelure. Galarian Weezing counters Conkeldurr and can provide Defog support to prevent Skarmory from being worn down into range of Mamoswine's Icicle Crash.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Kingdra is a threatening sweeper on rain teams thanks to its decent Speed and ability Swift Swim, which allow it to outrun the entire unboosted metagame in rain. This can help it against opposing rain teams, outrunning archetype staples like Keldeo and Salamence. In addition to a powerful rain-boosted Hydro Pump, Kingdra has Draco Meteor, allowing it to heavily damage Water-resistant Pokemon like Salamence and Rotom-W. It can additionally threaten Grass-types like Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth, which some Pokemon on rain builds struggle with, thanks to Hurricane. Kingdra's damage output can be rather middling at times, however, due to its merely decent Special Attack. Alongside its slightly lacking coverage, this can prevent it from reliably beating popular Pokemon like Chansey and Primarina. It faces intense competition from Barraskewda, another Pokemon with Swift Swim but better immediate power, higher Speed, and easier pivoting capabilities for generating momentum against checks. Kingdra additionally faces competition as a Water-type special attacker on rain teams, with Keldeo offering more immediate power and a way to beat special walls with Secret Sword, and as a Dragon-type, with Salamence also offering Hydro Pump and Hurricane but with far better defensive utility and longevity. Lastly, Kingdra's Speed and damage output can be rather middling outside of rain, causing it to be overreliant on Politoed's Drizzle.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Choice Specs further amplifies Kingdra's damage output. However, it can be taken advantage of quite easily if locked into one of its attacks. Flip Turn allows Kingdra to pivot away from switch-ins it can't reliably damage, like Chansey and bulky Primarina. However, Kingdra doesn't enjoy taking Life Orb damage from pivoting and often makes better use of Surf, a highly spammable move. Dragon Pulse hits foes like Salamence without decreasing Kingdra's Special Attack, preventing it from becoming setup bait, although the move's low power against Pokemon like Rotom-W rarely makes it a worthy option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Chansey: Chansey's amazing special bulk and reliable recovery allow it to consistently switch into Kingdra. It can wear Kingdra down with either Seismic Toss or Toxic, take advantage of it to pivot with Teleport, or restore its health with Soft-Boiled.</p> <p><strong>Bulky Water-types</strong>: Kingdra struggles to power through many bulky Water-types due to its lack of a move that can KO them. Mantine's superb special bulk allows it to stomach Draco Meteor, while its Water-type immunity and Roost let it switch in on Kingdra. Jellicent and Gastrodon both take a fair amount of damage from Draco Meteor, but they can heal the damage with Recover and are also immune to Kingdra's Water-type moves. Bulky Primarina sets can utilize their resistance and immunity to Kingdra's STAB combination to switch in and threaten it with STAB Moonblast.</p> <p><strong>Various Revenge Killers: Timid Trace Gardevoir and Barraskewda can outspeed Kingdra in rain and threaten it.

Hurricane has perfect accuracy in rain and can nab 2HKOs on Grass-types like Zarude, Amoonguss, and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Surf is a perfectly accurate Water-type move that Kingdra can use against foes that it does not require the power of Hydro Pump to reliably power through, such as Moltres, Krookodile, and Rotom-H. A Modest nature allows Kingdra to always 2HKO uninvested Primarina with Hydro Pump in rain after Stealth Rock. A Timid nature increases Kingdra's Speed even further, allowing it to outrun and threaten opposing Modest Kingdra and Speed tie Trace Gardevoir, although this is realistically the only situation where the additional Speed would matter.</p> <p>Kingdra only fits on offensive rain structures due to its tools as a sweeper being specific to the archetype, relying a lot on Politoed. Wallbreakers like Azumarill, Thundurus-T, and Crawdaunt are solid fits on rain teams and can help punch holes in teams for Kingdra to clean late-game. They can be particularly helpful for overwhelming bulky Water-types like Mantine and Primarina as well as Chansey. Barraskewda offers a physical wallbreaking presence to more easily beat foes like Chansey and Primarina and can additionally clean up late-game if Kingdra can't. Keldeo can also combat Chansey, which is Kingdra's biggest hurdle, and importantly help overwhelm Primarina. In return, Kingdra can open up more opportunities for Keldeo by threatening one of its sturdiest checks in Assault Vest Tangrowth. Entry hazard support allows Kingdra to power through foes more easily. Seismitoad in particular is a Stealth Rock setter that can fit well on rain teams thanks to Swift Swim and its key Electric-type immunity.

Pokemon that can sponge Knock Off such as Buzzwole and Heavy-Duty Boots Zarude are also treasured on Suicune's team, as Suicune despises losing its Leftovers. Zarude is especially appreciated, as it can also threaten KOs on Water-resistant foes such as Gastrodon and Seismitoad, which would otherwise completely wall Suicune.</p> "

Good matchups against top threats like Jirachi, Krookodile, and Lycanroc-D contribute to Swampert's great defensive utility. Flip Turn also lets it be a slow pivot, limiting its passivity, making progress against walls such as Chansey, and bringing in slower teammates like Conkeldurr to wallbreak. However, many of the tier's threats hinder Swampert. Grass-types like Tangrowth and Zarude threaten to OHKO it, while powerful wallbreakers like Conkeldurr and Azumarill take advantage of its lack of reliable recovery to break through it. Swampert is also very vulnerable to status and Knock Off, especially from Pokemon it should check like Excadrill and Nihilego, which make it much less effective as a tank. Swampert also competes for a team slot with fellow hazard setter Ground-types Excadrill and Krookodile, which keep up offensive pressure more consistently.</p> ",

Scald can potentially burn foes like Skarmory that Swampert otherwise struggles against, but it is hard to slot into Swampert's moveset over its other utility moves. High Horsepower is a good alternative to Earthquake if Swampert is being run alongside Tapu Bulu, since Grassy Surge weakens Earthquake, but is an inferior pick otherwise. A physically defensive EV spread with a Relaxed nature allows Swampert to tank powerful physical attacks from foes like Mamoswine, Lycanroc-D, and Excadrill, but it makes Swampert more vulnerable to powerful special attackers like Thundurus-T and Azelf.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types and Grass-type Coverage: Pokemon such as Amoonguss, Zarude, Tangrowth, and Tapu Bulu can easily scare Swampert out with their 4x super effective STAB moves, though the latter two do not like the potential of being inflicted by Toxic.

However, Torkoal struggles with longevity, as it needs to use Heat Rock over Heavy-Duty Boots to provide more sun turns for its teammates, meaning every time it comes in it risks taking significant chip from entry hazards like Stealth Rock. It also has a lack of recovery, making it vulnerable to common enemy leads like Excadrill and Krookodile. Torkoal is also a momentum sink, meaning that the player will have to either switch directly into their sun sweepers like Venusaur and Chandelure, potentially forcing them to take damage, or sacrifice Torkoal to bring them in safely.

Thanks to its low Speed, Torkoal can also be run on Trick Room teams, utilizing a powerful sun-boosted Eruption.

Lum Berry can give Salamence more room to set up on Pokemon like Swampert and Tangrowth, but it doesn't carry as much consistent utility as Life Orb. Dragon Tail on the defensive set over Dual Wingbeat lets Salamence spread residual damage with entry hazards, though this is less functional than Toxic against foes like Azumarill.

Dual Wingbeat also has the benefit of hitting Keldeo through Substitute, though risking a burn from Scald is not ideal. Earthquake OHKOes Aegislash and Jirachi at +2. Fire Blast can be used instead to lure in and break through Skarmory and increase Salamence's chances for a Moxie sweep. Life Orb can be used to OHKO Pokemon such as Aegislash with +1 Earthquake and Primarina with +2 Dual Wingbeat. It can also be used alongside a Naive nature to ensure that Fire Blast OHKOes Skarmory after Stealth Rock. However, Salamence's Stealth Rock weakness and Life Orb recoil will quickly put it into range for Lycanroc-D's Accelerock. Moxie helps Salamence get multiple boosts to KO bulky targets like Aegislash and makes it more difficult to revenge kill.</p> <p>This set fits on offense and hyper offense teams as a wallbreaker or late-game cleaner with Moxie. Excadrill is an excellent lead that sets Stealth Rock to wear down bulky Pokemon such as Rotom-W and provides Rapid Spin. Sticky Web from Ribombee lets Salamence outspeed foes such as Nihilego. Celesteela walls this set, so early-game wallbreakers such as Nasty Plot Thundurus-T and Azelf are decent options. They also appreciate Salamence's ability to threaten Chansey. Other teammates that overwhelm physically bulky Pokemon such as Quagsire and Skarmory, such as Gyarados and Aegislash are valuable assets to this set. They also heavily benefit Salamence by overwhelming checks like Amoonguss and Primarina. Pivots such as Jirachi and Zarude can position Salamence to set up on Pokemon like Tangrowth.

Flamethrower wears down Steel-types like Excadrill and Celesteela, though Earthquake can be used to KO Nihilego while retaining coverage for the former. Earthquake Intimidate alongside the additional HP investment makes Salamence a more sturdy switch-in to Conkeldurr, Zarude, and Gyarados, although it has to be wary of the latter's Ice Fang.

Quagsire keeps Salamence from being overwhelmed by opposing Dragon Dance Salamence and Lycanroc-D and benefits from Salamence checking Grass-types. Knock Off support from teammates such as Nihilego is very beneficial so that Salamence can outlast threats such as Aegislash. Bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth are useful switch-ins into special attackers such as Primarina and Thundurus-T.

Serene Grace gives Iron Head a high chance to flinch slower foes like Hydreigon, making Choice Scarf Jirachi extremely difficult to deal with for offensive teams. Additionally, Jirachi's above average bulk and great defensive typing allow it to check threats like Nihilego and Hatterene. Jirachi can fulfill a wide variety of roles on teams, whether it's revenge killing threats like Azelf with Choice Scarf, providing great utility in the form of Stealth Rock and Healing Wish, or healing its team with Wish. However, Jirachi's reliance on Leftovers for checking Pokemon like Salamence and Hatterene makes it susceptible to Knock Off from Nihilego and Tangrowth. Jirachi has only average offensive stats, making it very reliant on Iron Head flinches to make progress against foes it lacks coverage for, with common defensive staples like Aegislash, Excadrill, and Amoonguss walling it regardless.</p> ",

Jirachi can run a Substitute + Toxic set to wear down switch-ins like Rotom-W and Tangrowth, with Iron Head flinches accelerating Toxic damage, but it requires lots of team support, including removing Rocky Helmet and dealing with Toxic walls like Tentacruel and Zarude. Additionally, Jirachi faces heavy competition from SubToxic Aegislash due to it having better defensive stats and King's Shield to make progress. Jirachi can utilize a special attacker set with Meteor Beam to lure in and remove common switch-ins like Moltres and Rotom-H. However, this set struggles cover everything. Jirachi can use Calm Mind sets to sweep on hyper offense teams, but these also struggle to choose their coverage. Jirachi can utilize a mixed set, which can notably KO Amoonguss with Psychic while nailing Hatterene with Iron Head, but it lacks in power compared to other offensive Psychic-types like Azelf. Jirachi can run Stored Power sets with Calm Mind and Weakness Policy to accumulate many boosts and sweep, but these sets struggle to get past Aegislash and can be ineffective without many boosts.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types such as Rotom-H, Moltres, and Chandelure take very little from Jirachi's attacks and can force it out with their powerful STAB attacks. Jirachi especially dislikes a burn from Moltres's Flame Body. However, none of them like Jirachi using Trick to remove their Heavy-Duty Boots.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Celesteela takes very little from Jirachi's attacks and can wear it down with Leech Seed + Flamethrower. Aegislash walls Jirachi and can use it as setup fodder or force it out. Excadrill also walls Jirachi and can devastate it with Earthquake. Cobalion and Skarmory can set entry hazards in front of Jirachi and chip it with Rocky Helmet recoil, though they dislike Trick and Thunder Wave.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Bulky Water-types like Rotom-W, Seismitoad, and Swampert take very little from Jirachi's attacks and can cripple it or decently damage it. Volcanion quadruply resists Jirachi's Iron Head and can force it out. Slowking only fears Trick from Jirachi and can cripple it with a Scald burn.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Dark-types like Zarude, Krookodile, and Hydreigon offensively threaten Jirachi and force it out. Zarude and Choice Scarf sets of the latter two can revenge kill non-Choice Scarf Jirachi, with Choice Scarf Zarude outspeeding Choice Scarf variants as well. Mandibuzz and Umbreon don't mind Iron Head much and can wear it down with Foul Play. The latter also uses Inner Focus to block flinches and freely pass Wish to its teammates.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off: Pokemon carrying Knock Off like Tangrowth and Azelf can remove Leftovers to cripple defensive Jirachi, especially sets without Wish. Choice Scarf Jirachi becomes a much worse revenge killer without its item and can struggle to use Trick and Healing Wish effectively.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage and Status</strong>: Due to Jirachi lacking reliable one-turn recovery, it is prone to getting worn down by entry hazards like Spikes as well as Rocky Helmet users like Skarmory, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss. Jirachi also hates burns and paralysis from Pokemon like Moltres and Rotom-W, with paralysis making it hard to outspeed threats like Krookodile and leverage U-turn.</p> ",

    "overview": "<p>Tangrowth's stellar ability in Regenerator, good defensive typing, and vast movepool let it hold an Assault Vest, turning it into a special wall that can check prominent threats like Keldeo, Aegislash, and Primarina. Its naturally huge Defense also lets it check physical attackers like Zarude and Rhyperior well enough even without investiment. Physically defensive sets can also check threats like Lycanroc-D, Kommo-o, and Crawdaunt very well. Access to moves like Knock Off, Sleep Powder, and Sludge Bomb let Tangrowth severely cripple defensive Pokemon such as Chansey, Aegislash, and Rotom-H. However, Tangrowth's typing can also hinder it, giving it weaknesses to types like Poison and Fire, forcing it to switch out from threats like Nidoking and Moltres. Tangrowth faces competition from Amoonguss as a defensive Grass-type, as the latter's Poison typing lets it check threats like Primarina, Keldeo, and opposing Tangrowth more reliably; it can also put foes to sleep more reliably thanks to Spore. However, Tangrowth's huge Defense, generally lower passivity, and ability to cripple walls like Chansey with Knock Off are invaluable. Tangrowth hates being setup fodder for Pokemon like Rotom-H and Galarian Slowbro, which often force it to switch out against them, and its abysmal Special Defense means its physically defensive set struggles against special attackers like Primarina, Thundurus-T, and mixed Kommo-o; this makes specially defensive walls mandatory teammates. Finally, Assault Vest Tangrowth is prone to Knock Off from Pokemon it would check, like Azelf, which defeats its role as a special wall.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Leech Seed is an option to wear down switch-ins like Aegislash, but it is easily avoided by switching out and by pivoting from Pokemon like Rotom-W and Moltres. Other Pokemon like opposing Tangrowth, Hatterene, and Amoonguss are not affected by Leech Seed, making it hard to justify using over Giga Drain's immediate recovery. Stun Spore can be considered to slow down and cripple Pokemon like Nidoking, Mienshao, and Tentacruel, but its accuracy is shaky and common Pokemon like Rotom-W and Amoonguss are immune to it. Sleep Powder can immobilize various switch-ins like Salamence and Moltres, preventing them from taking advantage of Tangrowth, but also has shaky accuracy and isn't as consistently useful as other moves. Rock Slide smacks Moltres while additionally dealing fair damage to foes like Rotom-H and Togekiss. However, it generally offers far worse coverage than Tangrowth's other moves.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Steel-types: All of the tier's Steel-types can switch directly into Tangrowth. Jirachi can use Tangrowth to set hazards up or heal itself, Celesteela forces physically defensive Tangrowth out with Flamethrower, and Aegislash can cripple Assault Vest variants with Toxic and destroy physically defensive ones with Shadow Ball. However, they all dislike Knock Off, especially the latter two.</p> <p><strong>Poison-types: Nidoqueen, Nihilego, Amoonguss, and Tentacruel can hit Tangrowth with their respective STAB moves, and Tentacruel can also damage Tangrowth with Liquid Ooze if it ever uses Giga Drain. Since they force Tangrowth out with offensive pressure, the former two can use it to set Stealth Rock. Amoonguss takes little from Tangrowth's moves and only dislikes Knock Off, forcing Tangrowth to switch out; this gives Amoonguss a free opportunity to put one of Tangrowth's teammate to sleep via Spore. Tentacruel can remove Tangrowth's Assault Vest with Knock Off.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Tangrowth is extremely pressured by Fire-types such as Rotom-H, Moltres, and Chandelure and is almost always forced out. The former two can use Volt Switch or U-turn, respectively, to predict a switch and keep momentum, but Tangrowth can stomach a Fire-type attack from them and remove their item with Knock Off in return if needed. Incineroar threatens Tangrowth with Overheat, can remove its item with Knock Off, and can pivot out with Parting Shot.</p> <p><strong>Special Attackers: Even with an Assault Vest, Nidoking, Salamence, Nihilego, and Chandelure can all get past Tangrowth with their powerful super effective STAB attacks.

    "overview": "<p>Rotom-W's typing and Levitate allow it to be an effective pivot that comes in against notable threats such as Mamoswine, Moltres, Pelipper, and Celesteela. Rotom-W can act as an effective entry hazard remover due to its great matchup against common entry hazard setters like Rhyperior and Krookodile. Other utility options like Pain Split and Will-O-Wisp allow it to make progress even when the opponent switches to its checks and counters. Its Choice Scarf set is also notable for addtionally providing solid speed control while still acting as a Ground-type immunity and hazard removal. Sadly, Rotom-W's poor HP stat in conjunction with its reliance on Leftovers and Pain Split for recovery holds back its ability to act as a reliable pivot and exacerbates its vulnerability to poison, burn, and Stealth Rock damage. While Rotom-W does have some useful resistances, it needs to be healthy or used with prediction to pivot against foes that can potentially dent it greatly, such as Ground-types that have a strong secondary STAB move like Nidoking and Diggersby.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Rocky Helmet has the benefit of punishing the likes of Jirachi for spamming U-turn or contact moves, though losing the passive recovery from Leftovers is not ideal. Maximum Defense investment with a Bold nature makes Rotom-W a more effective pivot against Keldeo and Mamoswine, but the loss in Speed hampers it against foes like Nidoking and Chandelure. Nasty Plot + Pain Split turns Rotom-W into a wallbreaker, but it still has immense problems with Grass-types. This set also sacrifices Volt Switch in favor of Thunderbolt or Discharge, which makes the matchup against Grass-types even worse. Rindo Berry can be used if the team is too weak to Dragon Dance Gyarados, as it can prevent an OHKO from +2 Adamant Power Whip and provide a safety net against Tapu Bulu if Will-O-Wisp misses.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types and Grass-type Coverage: Rotom-W cannot deal any significant damage to the likes of Tangrowth and Amoonguss aside from burning them. Though Tapu Bulu dislikes Will-O-Wisp, it can still threaten Rotom-W with Horn Leech to restore health. Zarude can use Jungle Healing to disregard status completely. However, all of them lose momentum to Volt Switch as they switch in. Rotom-W also must watch out for Grass-type coverage on Pokemon like Gyarados and Azelf.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-types: Kommo-o only dislikes status from Rotom-W and is able to freely set up with Clangorous Soul. Zygarde-10%'s Thousand Arrows ignores Levitate, meaning it heavily punishes teams that solely rely on Rotom-W to deal with Ground-types. Salamence outspeed and nails Rotom-W with a powerful Draco Meteor.</p> <p><strong>Seismitoad and Gastrodon: Seismitoad and Gastrodon shut down Rotom-W nearly completely if it is not carrying Toxic. Seismitoad can cripple Rotom-W with Toxic and is the only Stealth Rock setter that is immune to both Hydro Pump and Volt Switch, and Gastrodon does not care much about Will-O-Wisp.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Volt Switch is required so Rotom-W can gain momentum against Grass- and Dragon-types such as Tangrowth and Kommo-o while bringing in teammates like Chandelure and Primarina to threaten them. Hydro Pump destroys common entry hazard setters such as Rhyperior and Krookodile. Pain Split is Rotom-W's only recovery move and gives Rotom-W more utility against bulkier teams, though it can be easy to play around. Will-O-Wisp cripples Amoonguss, Dragon Dance Salamence, and Tangrowth. Other status moves can be used over Will-O-Wisp; Toxic limits Seismitoad and Gastrodon's longevity better, whereas Thunder Wave cripples Noivern and Kommo-o. Defog is an alternative option because Rotom-W has several opportunities to remove hazards, such as when facing Celesteela and Jirachi, while having a good matchup against many of the entry hazard setters. Leftovers is Rotom-W's primary way of standing up to repeated U-turn and Stealth Rock damage. Maximum Speed EVs allow Rotom-W to outspeed and OHKO Nidoking as well as potentially cripple offensive Kommo-o with Will-O-Wisp.</p> <p>Rotom-W fits on bulky offense and balance teams, which appreciate its ability to check Mamoswine and Moltres. U-turn users such as Zarude and Moltres form VoltTurn cores with Rotom-W that can be difficult to stop, as Rotom-W threatens their checks such as Rotom-H and Rhyperior. Rotom-W appreciates Moltres's ability to pressure Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Tangrowth. Wallbreakers such as Buzzwole, Entei, and Nidoking appreciate Rotom-W's Volt Switch allowing them to pressure defensive cores relying on Pokemon such as Chansey and Tangrowth. Grass-types such as Tangrowth and Zarude can help remove Seismitoad and Gastrodon and patch any weaknesses against Zygarde-10%. Zarude also forms a VoltTurn core with Rotom-W and appreciates Rotom-W sponging Krookodile's Knock Off if its item is still required, this being particularly important for Choice Scarf variants.</p> "

Volt Switch helps Rotom-W offensively threaten foes such as +1 Gyarados, Keldeo, and Starmie. Thunderbolt can be used over Volt Switch to apply more reliable pressure against foes like Mantine and Galarian Moltres, although Volt Switch is more consistent. Defog allows Rotom-W to remove entry hazards before being KOed or as it forces out Pokemon like Mantine and Moltres. Pain Split over Defog gives Rotom-W more longevity. However, finding other options for entry hazard removal can be challenging and create more strain on teambuilding. Trick is vital because it cripples defensive pivots such as Chansey, Amoonguss, and Tangrowth. However, Rotom-W should only use Trick after the additional Speed is no longer necessary, as it will no longer be able to outspeed threats such as Lycanroc-D and Zygarde-10%. Choice Scarf allows Rotom-W to revenge kill threats such as Lycanroc-D and Krookodile as well as maintain momentum against other Pokemon that would otherwise outspeed and deal massive damage such as Salamence. The additional speed also helps Rotom-W scout and maintain momentum against unfavorable matchups such as Zarude and Roserade more reliably.</p> <p>Choice Scarf Rotom-W fits best on offense, balance, and bulky offense teams that appreciate its role compression as a Ground-immune offensive pivot and revenge killer that provides momentum and emergency entry hazard removal. Other pivots such as Mienshao form a potent VoltTurn core with Rotom-W, as they overwhelm each other's checks; Mienshao deals with Chansey and Zarude, while Rotom-W deals with Moltres and Nihilego. Entry hazard setters such as Jirachi, Nihilego, and Krookodile wear down targets for Rotom-W. The former is able to form a VoltTurn core with Rotom-W, while the latter two can cripple Pokemon such as Aegislash and Salamence with Knock Off. Wallbreakers such as Entei, Nidoking, and Mamoswine are fantastic partner that break through Pokemon Rotom-W grants them safe entry on, such as Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Galarian Slowbro. Hatterene deals with Pokemon that would otherwise take advantage of Rotom-W like Seismitoad and Kommo-o. Hatterene's Magic Bounce also assists Rotom-W in its role as entry hazard control and makes Rotom-W more comfortable with running Pain Split. Rotom-W's role compression means it can struggle against Entei and Jirachi in the long-term, so teammates such as RestTalk Primarina, Aegislash, and Moltres help relieve pressure.</p> "

Access to Knock Off and U-turn also makes it a great offensive pivot that can threaten tier staples like Aegislash and Tangrowth. Despite Azelf's elite Speed, common Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Zarude easily revenge kill it. Azelf does not have much bulk and lacks recovery, leaving it worn down quickly and making it difficult to set up with Nasty Plot. It also needs pivot support to get in safely, as it typically cannot directly switch into any attack. Azelf struggles to fit all the moves it needs on its Nasty Plot set, as without Energy Ball Azelf struggles to break Slowking and Swampert, whereas without Dazzling Gleam it is completely walled by Hydreigon and Mandibuzz. Thundurus-T gives Azelf large competition as a special wallbreaker and pivot, having more power, a better typing, and no 4MSS.

Azelf can also be a Choice Band user with its great Speed tier and wide physical movepool, boasting options like Knock Off, U-turn, Zen Headbutt, Ice Punch, Explosion, and Trick. However, it is usually unable to OHKO its foes and outclassed by Pokemon like Azumarill, which provides priority and is much stronger.

Psyshock is the preferred STAB option to OHKO Nihilego and Tentacruel without a boost, and it also hits Chansey considerably harder than Psychic. Fire Blast OHKOes defensive Celesteela and Assault Vest Tangrowth at +2. It also covers many key threats such as Jirachi, Skarmory, and Excadrill. The last move is dependent on Azelf's team; Energy Ball is able to nail Slowking, Swampert, Azumarill, and Rhyperior for super effective damage. Meanwhile, Dazzling Gleam is an option to OHKO Hydreigon, 2HKO Salamence, and hit Galarian Moltres and Mandibuzz super effectively while also maintaining coverage for Krookodile. It also prevents Umbreon from completely walling Azelf. Since Azelf will typically be hitting its foes for super effective damage, Expert Belt is enough to OHKO nearly everything. Life Orb can be used to increase Azelf's damage output more consistently on targets that it cannot hit super effectively, like Hatterene and Moltres, but the chip damage adds up quickly and leaves Azelf more vulnerable to revenge killers with priority like Lycanroc-D.</p> <p>Nasty Plot Azelf is best used on hyper offense builds that can offer it support, although it can also fit on certain balance teams as a late-game wincon. An entry hazard setter like Nihilego, Excadrill, or Krookodile helps weaken foes like Chansey and Primarina into KO range of +2 Azelf. Ribombee can provide Sticky Web support to boost Azelf's ability to clean through teams, as Sticky Web invalidates common Choice Scarf users like Mienshao and Zarude as revenge killers. It also ensures Azelf does not lose any Speed ties with Zygarde-10%. A pivot like Zarude can get Azelf in safely against Pokemon like Amoonguss. A wallbreaker like Azumarill or Mamoswine can help punch holes in the enemy team, significantly weakening them for Azelf to sweep later.

Tapu Bulu also checks faster threats to Conkeldurr like Primarina and Azumarill. Wish from Jirachi or Sylveon can also support it well. Conkeldurr struggles to break through physical walls like Galarian Weezing and Tangrowth in the short term, so teammates who can threaten these like Moltres and Aegislash are appreciated. Entry hazard setters like Diancie and Krookodile can wear down checks like Skarmory with Stealth Rock for Conkeldurr to muscle through easier. Diancie can also check many revenge killers to Conkeldurr like Togekiss, Salamence, and Galarian Moltres. Slow pivots like Chansey, Slowking, and Mandibuzz  can help bring Conkeldurr into play against threats like Excadrill, Zarude, and Lycanroc-D. Slowking can also provide Future Sight support to further amplify Conkeldurr's wallbreaking power. Late-game cleaners like Thundurus-T are able to clean up after Conkeldurr softens up the opposing team. In return, they can pressure Flying-types like Togekiss and Salamence.</p> "

Seismitoad has a positive matchup against some of the entry hazard removers of the tier such as the aforementioned Rotom formes and Tentacruel. Seismitoad is a valuable asset on rain teams as a Stealth Rock setter and wallbreaker that does well against offensive threats such as Thundurus-T and Lycanroc-D due to its defensive typing. However, Seismitoad's lack of reliable recovery outside of Leftovers makes it vulnerable to status effects and Knock Off. Seismitoad's crippling weakness to Grass-types gives Pokemon like Amoonguss and Zarude free entry and bad matchups against threats that carry Grass-type coverage moves such as Nihilego and Gyarados. Seismitoad also faces competition from Gastrodon, as it has access to Recover, though Seismitoad has important access to Stealth Rock and is less passive.

However, this considerably cuts into Seismitoad's bulk, which is often less than ideal.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-type Pokemon and Coverage Moves: Seismitoad's defensive set often invites in Pokemon like Tangrowth and Amoonguss, which are more difficult to outlast due to Regenerator.

Scald gives Seismitoad a chance to burn switch-ins such as Kommo-o and Tapu Bulu. It also provides long-term chip damage on Amoonguss so it does not get the most out of Regenerator. Earthquake gives Seismitoad a better matchup against Calm Mind users like Keldeo and Galarian Slowbro at the cost of reducing Scald's damage output. Earth Power is usable to hit targets like Kommo-o harder but is generally not worth it, as Seismitoad now becomes setup fodder for the aforementioned Keldeo and Galarian Slowbro, and Earth Power fails to OHKO Nihilego. Toxic makes Seismitoad less passive against the likes of Tangrowth and Gastrodon switching in. It also helps Seismitoad outlast other Defoggers such as Salamence and Rotom-W.

Its decent STAB combination alongside Earthquake pressures a majority of the tier. Scolipede's typing also provides it with opportunities to set up against foes such as Tangrowth and prevents it from being crippled by Toxic.

The UU tier also has an abundance of priority users like Lycanroc-D, Azumarill, and Zygarde-10% that can easily pick off Scolipede. Albeit having a respectable Attack stat, Scolipede struggles to break through physically defensive walls such as Celesteela, Skarmory, and Mandibuzz even after a Swords Dance boost.

Intimidate lets Krookodile switch into resisted and neutral hits such as Lycanroc-D's Stone Edge without getting too worn down. It also helps prevent late-game sweeps from Pokemon like Salamence. Moves like Stealth Rock and Taunt let Krookodile compress utility roles, and its ability to run a plethora of items, like Life Orb, Leftovers, Choice Scarf, Choice Band, and resist berries, makes for a key factor in its unpredictability and versatility.

  "Amoonguss": {
    "overview": "<p>Amoonguss is a potent defensive pivot due to its good defensive typing, which enables it to check dangerous foes such as Azumarill, Primarina, and Zarude, combined with its access to Regenerator. Access to Spore allows Amoonguss to shut down an opposing foe completely, making it harder to play around and offensively check due to pressuring opponents to choose sleep fodder. Its Poison typing additionally gives it an edge over other common Grass-types, as it is able to threaten Tangrowth and Zarude with Sludge Bomb, which also prevents them from switching in to absorb Spore. However, despite Amoonguss's good defensive typing, it struggles against metagame staples like Salamence and Mamoswine. It can also be overwhelmed by Pokemon it is supposed to check due to their access to coverage, such as Ice Punch from Azumarill, Psychic from Primarina, and Zen Headbutt from Tapu Bulu. After using Spore, Amoonguss is easy to take advantage of by Pokemon that take little from its other moves such as Galarian Slowbro, Celesteela, Skarmory, and Galarian Moltres. Amoonguss faces competition from Tangrowth as a defensive Grass-type pivot, which can opt to run Assault Vest sets to check specially offensive foes such as Aegislash and Thundurus-T better and not be neutral to Excadrill and Zygarde-10%'s Ground-type STAB.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Assault Vest allows Amoonguss to act as a better check to special attackers like Keldeo and Thundurus-T. It can even still run utility moves like Spore due to Amoonguss's tendency to get hit with Knock Off. Seed Bomb does more damage to Calm Mind Primarina, particularly Substitute sets that can boost enough to stop Sludge Bomb breaking the Substitute. However, it does less damage to most other Water-types and loses out on the recovery of Giga Drain. Stun Spore can be useful to cripple Aegislash, but it is very hard to fit.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Psychic-types and Psychic-type coverage: Offensive Psychic-types like Necrozma and Azelf can force out Amoonguss with their powerful attacks. If it has Safety Goggles, Galarian Slowbro can easily setup on Amoonguss. Psychic-type coverage like Psychic Fangs on Lycanroc-D and Psychic on Primarina and Thundurus-T also dent Amoonguss.</p> <p><strong>Fire-types: Rotom-H threatens Amoonguss with Overheat and can gain momentum with Volt Switch or set up with Nasty Plot. Entei and Chandelure can threaten to OHKO Amoonguss with their powerful STAB.</p> <p><strong>Flying-types: Salamence, Togekiss, and Moltres all deal heavy damage to Amoonguss with their STAB attacks. Galarian Moltres can easily pivot into Amoonguss, not fearing status thanks to Rest, and either nail it with Hurricane or set up on it.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers: While Amoonguss is bulky, it can be overwhelmed by wallbreakers such as Nidoking, Mamoswine, and Diggersby. These Pokemon all fear Spore, however, so they can only effectively threaten Amoonguss if a teammate has been put to sleep or they are brought in safely. Conkeldurr is able to overwhelm Amoonguss with Facade and is immune to Spore once its Flame Orb activates.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Giga Drain heavily damages Lycanroc-D and Keldeo, which Amoonguss naturally checks by virtue of its typing and bulk. It also enables Amoonguss to regain some HP, reducing the need for it to continually pivot for Regenerator recovery. Alternatively, Synthesis can be run to instantly regain health, though its low PP should be noticed. Sludge Bomb threatens Primarina, Zarude, and Azumarill. It is also useful for the chance to poison switch-ins such as Salamence and Mandibuzz. Foul Play dents physical attackers such as Gyarados and prevents them from setting up on Amoonguss, and it is also Amoonguss's best way to damage other Steel-types such as Aegislash and Jirachi. Spore shuts down Pokemon such as Moltres and Hydreigon, deterring them from wanting to pivot into it. This often requires an opposing team to use a Pokemon as sleep fodder, making it easier for Amoonguss's teammates to capitalize on. Stun Spore is an option that can be run alongside Spore to potentially cripple Pokemon like Celesteela and Nihilego that would otherwise wall it once a Pokemon has been slept. Rocky Helmet punishes physical attackers Amoonguss switches into such as Azumarill and Zarude. Eject Button can be run so Amoonguss can pivot into a foe, take a hit, and bring in a teammate safely. Black Sludge is an alternative option that reduces Amoonguss's reliance on switching out to regain HP with Regenerator. 36 Special Defense EVs guarantee that Amoonguss can take a Choice Specs-boosted Psychic from Primarina as well as better check Keldeo. A more specially defensive spread can be used to better check Keldeo and Aegislash, though this gives Amoonguss a worse matchup against Excadrill and Lycanroc-D.</p> <p>Amoonguss fits best on bulky offense, balance, and stall teams that appreciate its ability to blanket check dangerous metagame staples such as Azumarill and Primarina. Chansey can take on special attackers like Nidoking, Moltres, and Salamence that can overwhelm Amoonguss. Checks to Moltres and Salamence, such as Diancie and Primarina, are useful partners that can switch into them and force it out. Dark-types such as Krookodile and Mandibuzz can check Psychic-types like Galarian Slowbro and Azelf. Mandibuzz also helps Amoonguss not get overwhelmed by Zygarde-10%. Amoonguss is heavily threatened by Fire-types such as Entei and Moltres, so checks to these such as Slowking and Swampert make good partners. Amoonguss is vulnerable to Stealth Rock and Spikes chip damage, and gives free opportunities for Pokemon such as Nihilego and Skarmory to set these after Spore has been used, so entry hazard removal support from partners such as Salamence and Excadrill enables it to switch in more often and prevents entry hazards from cancelling out its Regenerator recovery.</p> "

  "Chandelure": {
    "overview": "<p>Chandelure's amazing Special Attack stat, threatening STAB combination, and wide utility movepool make it a strong offensive presence capable of working around most of its checks. Choice Specs is an excellent option for its immediate wallbreaking prowess and ability to utilize utility moves like Sleep Talk and Trick. Alternatively, Hex Chandelure can take advantage of the switches it forces to burden switch-ins like Primarina and Kommo-o with status, wearing them down with chip damage and STAB Hex throughout the match. Chandelure's typing also offers a few defensive benefits, letting it soft check popular Pokemon like Celesteela and Amoonguss. Unfortunately, Chandelure's rather average Speed and common weaknesses allow UU's many faster threats, including Keldeo, Krookodile, and Nihilego, to overwhelm it. Moreover, it is weak to Stealth Rock, which can significantly damage its longevity on sets that aren't running Heavy-Duty Boots. The other Fire- and Ghost-types available in UU also give Chandelure great competition, with Moltres offering greater utility through its typing, recovery, and pivoting capabilities, and Aegislash both lacking a Stealth Rock weakness and being more versatile overall.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Substitute + Calm Mind is an okay option for a set, taking advantage of defensive foes like Chansey to find setup opportunities. However, Chandelure's other sets are more immediately powerful, which is often more valuable for it. Will-O-Wisp is an option over Toxic on the Hex set, inflicting status on foes immune to poison like Tentacruel and Nihilego. However, Toxic is usually more valuable due to its greater long-term chip damage on Pokemon like Primarina and Gastrodon, as well as its ability to hit Fire-types like Rotom-H and Moltres. Energy Ball is a situational option for powering through various Pokemon, like Rhyperior, Gastrodon, and Seismitoad, in one hit. It also deals super effective damage to foes like Primarina and Suicune. Chandelure can still hit all the aforementioned targets hard with its Ghost-type moves, however. Choice Scarf Chandelure is an adequate revenge killer with its potent offensive typing, even still having the option of crippling defensive checks with Trick, though it notably lacks power and is usually only standout on sun teams. Memento allows Chandelure to grab momentum for its team after it's been weakened while potentially positioning a teammate to sweep. This is rather situational and gives up better utility, though, usually only working well on Choice item sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Water-types: Several Water-types can often find ways to give Chandelure trouble. Azumarill and Crawdaunt can apply serious pressure with their powerful STAB Aqua Jet. Primarina can take any hit from full health and power through Chandelure with its Water-type STAB moves. Tentacruel can be particularly annoying, tanking attacks with its good special bulk and checking the Hex set well thanks to its Toxic immunity. Although they fear Toxic, Milotic and Mantine make for solid answers thanks to their reliable recovery. Both can also often take two Choice Specs-boosted Shadow Balls from full, but they should be wary of being too worn down to reliably pivot in.</p> <p><strong>Dark-types: Krookodile and Zarude often struggle to reliably switch in, but they can outspeed Chandelure and pick it off with super effective STAB moves. Incineroar, albeit uncommon, resists both of Chandelure's STAB moves and can take advantage of it to annoy a switch-in with either Knock Off or status. Galarian Moltres's high Special Defense allows it to tank hits from Chandelure to then set up. Umbreon is another good check thanks to its superb special bulk and Heal Bell, which allow it to handle Hex sets on its own.</p> <p><strong>Faster threats: Chandelure's rather average Speed leaves it vulnerable to most faster Pokemon, such as Keldeo, Lycanroc-D, and Mienshao, which can smack it with super effective attacks.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Various specially bulky Pokemon can tank hits from Chandelure and cripple it in return. Chansey doesn't risk major damage from any attack, but it needs to look out for Trick or Taunt on the switch; Taunt leaves it completely unable to touch Chandelure. Nihilego can always take at least one Shadow Ball from full and pressure Chandelure with a super effective STAB moves. It's a particularly strong check to the Hex set, bearing an immunity to Toxic and taking minimal damage from Fire-type moves.</p> ",

Overheat is also an option, offering even more power and notably damaging foes like Bulletproof Kommo-o and Incineroar more reliably. However, its Special Attack drop makes Fire Blast more spammable. Flamethrower is strong and accurate, preventing foes like Aegislash, Tangrowth, and Amoonguss from utilizing a lucky Fire Blast miss to cripple Chandelure. Psychic is an option that provides coverage against Kommo-o and Nihilego, though both these targets are adequately worn down by Chandelure's other attacks. Sleep Talk lets Chandelure act as a sleep absorber for its team, pivoting in on Amoonguss's Spore without being entirely crippled. Trick is another option in the fourth moveslot, however, to cripple defensive switch-ins like Chansey, Incineroar, and Tentacruel. Flash Fire allows Chandelure to pivot in on Fire-type attacks from foes like Moltres and Choice-locked Entei, boosting its damage output. Flame Body is also an option, however, to potentially punish physical attackers such as Buzzwole.</p> <p>This set is a solid fit on offense and balance teams for the massive wallbreaking prowess it offers. Chandelure appreciates entry hazard support for furthering damage on foes alongside its attacks; Rhyperior and Seismitoad are solid choices, additionally pivoting in on foes that can revenge kill it like Lycanroc-D and Thundurus-T. Entry hazard removal is also important due to this set's vulnerability to Stealth Rock. Tentacruel can pivot in on foes like Keldeo and Primarina while utilizing Rapid Spin. Rotom-W is a particularly strong teammate, as it can lure in Grass-types like Amoonguss and pivot Chandelure into them with Volt Switch while also making use of Defog. Pivots that can bring Chandelure in safely for opportunities to wallbreak make good teammates. Zarude is another strong partner, pressuring foes like Primarina and Nihilego for Chandelure and bringing it in against Pokemon like Buzzwole and Amoonguss. Sweepers like Swords Dance Kommo-o and Calm Mind Keldeo appreciate this set's wallbreaking prowess weakening teams for them to more easily clean up late-game.

Toxic burdens potential switch-ins like Bulletproof Kommo-o, Gastrodon, and Salamence, putting them on a timer and allowing Chandelure to potentially whittle them down with Hex. Protect allows Chandelure to rack up poison damage and can also scout Choice item users, such as Zarude and Primarina. Fire Blast is an option over Flamethrower, providing more power for breaking past foes like Galarian Moltres and Nidoqueen more reliably. Its lower accuracy can be a burden, however, against foes like Amoonguss and Tangrowth that can punish a miss. Taunt is an option over Protect, allowing Chandelure to pressure Chansey more effectively by blocking Chansey's recovery and Toxic, which boosts its stall matchup. However, Protect is often too valuable thanks to its stronger applications against offensive Pokemon. Heavy-Duty Boots significantly boosts this set's longevity and self-sufficiency. Flash Fire allows Chandelure to take advantage of foes like opposing Choice-locked Chandelure. Flame Body is also an option, however, allowing it to pivot into and threaten a burn against foes like Jirachi and Celesteela. It can also let Chandelure cripple Pokemon that revenge kill it, like Knock Off Azelf, as it faints.</p> <p>This set is a strong fit on bulky offense and balance teams that appreciate Chandelure's ability to wear down defensive threats early- to mid-game. Chandelure notably struggles breaking past the likes of Nihilego and Tentacruel with this set's listed options, making Pokemon more equipped to handle them, like Nidoqueen and Seismitoad, good teammates. Both can also set Stealth Rock for Chandelure, whittling down its checks. Other entry hazard setters can work well too; Rhyperior can also ease the matchup against foes like Moltres and Nihilego without Grass Knot, and Kommo-o can pivot in on opposing Chandelure. Sweepers like Kommo-o and Keldeo appreciate Chandelure's ability to weaken bulky foes like Rhyperior and Primarina throughout a match with Toxic, allowing them to clean up more easily late-game. Chandelure appreciates them compensating for its slightly paltry Speed. Chandelure also enjoys pivots as teammates, as it doesn't often enjoy directly switching into play. In addition to providing pivoting support, Choice Scarf Jirachi can pressure faster Pokemon like Lycanroc-D and Nihilego, while Rotom-W can lure in Pokemon like Tangrowth for Chandelure to take advantage of. Rotom-W can also pivot in on various Ground-types, like Rhyperior and Krookodile. Other status spreaders can work well as teammates, alleviating Chandelure's need for prediction regarding Hex. Galarian Slowbro is particularly good at spreading status due to its tendency to run both Scald and Sludge Bomb. Tentacruel does this as well and can also utilize Knock Off to further cripple foes.</p> "

Entry hazard support from partners like Excadrill, Nihilego, and Jirachi can wear down foes like Azumarill and Tangrowth into KO range of its boosted attacks. These setters also help pressure and switch into Fairy-types like Hatterene and Primarina. Jirachi can also provide Healing Wish support for sets lacking Roost. Ribombee can provide Sticky Web to let Hydreigon beat revenge killers like Lycanroc-D and Jirachi. However, other fast Pokemon like Salamence and Thundurus-T are immune to Sticky Web, so offensive partners like Mamoswine and Lycanroc-D are useful to keep them in check. These partners also remove specially defensive walls like Chansey. Hydreigon can struggle to find setup opportunities, so pivots such as Moltres and Swampert can give it chances against Pokemon like Rotom-W and Slowking. Fighting-type checks such as Primarina, Amoonguss, and the aforementioned Moltres are necessary, as Conkeldurr and Cobalion can easily revenge kill Hydreigon. Late-game cleaners like Excadrill and Azelf appreciate Hydreigon breaking through defensive Pokemon such as Slowking, Celesteela, and Tangrowth.</p> "

Cobalion's Swords Dance set also stands out among other physical setup sweepers such as Aegislash and Ice Fang Gyarados by not fearing any of Amoonguss's attacks, becoming a fierce wallbreaker after Sleep Clause has been activated. Cobalion's typing has its drawbacks, though, as it is not Fairy or Flying resistant like other Steel-types, making Cobalion unreliable at switching into threats such as Hatterene and Galarian Moltres. Without Swords Dance, its offensive prowess also is underwhelming compared to its Fighting-type competition such as Mienshao and Kommo-o.

A Calm Mind set is able to bait Pokemon such as Buzzwole and give Cobalion a boost to its lackluster Special Defense.

Volt Switch is useful for helping Cobalion gain momentum against switch-ins like Moltres and giving safe entry to teammates such as Primarina.

Rotom-H and Moltres burn through checks like Amoonguss and Tangrowth for Cobalion and act as Defoggers so Cobalion can continue to act as a pivot. Both enjoy Cobalion deterring Knock Off and forming a VoltTurn core with them so they can provide a pivoting core for an offensive teammate like Lycanroc-D, which is also a solid revenge killer to threats such as Keldeo and Nidoking. Sylveon provides cleric support with Wish and Heal Bell while checking Keldeo and Salamence for it; in return, thanks to Sylveon's support, Cobalion is able to check Sylveon's answers like Jirachi and Nihilego more reliably throughout the match. Other Steel-types like Aegislash can pair up with Cobalion to circumvent its neutrality to Fairy and Flying, though this stacks weaknesses to Fire and Ground. Teammates such as Zarude and Azumarill deal with problematic Ground-types such as Zygarde-10% and Nidoking.

With Diggersby's low defenses and lack of any meaningful defensive utility outside of switching in on a predicted Electric-type attack with its Choice Scarf set, it needs to typically OHKO its foes to prevent taking heavy damage in return. Additionally, it is weak to common priority users such as Aqua Jet Azumarill and Mach Punch Conkeldurr.</p> ",

Body Slam can KO Rotom-H and Rotom-W on the switch with minimal chip damage, and Fire Punch deals substantial damage to typically defensive foes like Celesteela and Tangrowth. Unfortunately, this set is very prediction reliant. Additionally, Diggersby's poor Speed makes it easy for many foes like Zarude and Lycanroc-D to revenge kill it.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Faster Offensive Pokemon: Diggersby's main drawback is its below average Speed without Choice Scarf, allowing many offensive threats in the tier like Zarude and Lycanroc-D to OHKO it.

While Diggersby can threaten to OHKO Crawdaunt with +2 Quick Attack, it cannot do the same to Azumarill and Conkeldurr.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Defensive Pokemon like Skarmory, Tangrowth, and Celesteela effectively check Choice Scarf Diggersby, as Diggersby fails to inflict enough damage and all of these can threaten it offensively.

A Swords Dance-boosted Fire Punch OHKOs Celesteela, Skarmory after Stealth Rock, and has a chance to OHKO physically defensive Tangrowth after Stealth Rock. Mega Kick KOes Pokemon like Rotom-W and Rotom-H on the switch after minimal damage. It is a powerful STAB move capable of letting Diggersby still muscle past Tangrowth and Celesteela; however, it will have a much harder time getting past Skarmory. Body Slam can be used over Mega Kick as a more reliable option that will still deal enough damage to KO defensive Pokemon like Amoonguss after one Swords Dance boost. Life Orb provides Diggersby with the extra power needed to break through Tangrowth with Fire Punch, while boosting the power of its Quick Attack to pick off a weakened foe. Silk Scarf should primarily be considered if opting for Mega Kick over Fire Punch to retain the extra power to break through defensive cores and ability to clean late-game with +2 Quick Attack without the drawbacks of recoil.</p> <p>Diggersby best fits on offense teams, particularly ones that can offer entry hazard support. A Sticky Web setter like Ribombee helps Diggersby outspeed most of its common checks like Cobalion and Lycanroc-D. Jirachi can provide Stealth Rock support, Healing Wish to give Diggersby another chance to clean, and can lure in and remove Skarmory with Thunder while also weakening Celesteela for it. Other teammates like Rotom-H and Thundurus-T can help threaten Celesteela and Skarmory too. Additionally, these partners offer pivot support and can safely bring in Diggersby against their common switch-ins like Chansey. Nihilego can help check problematic Pokemon like Rotom-H and defensive Salamence for Diggersby, and in return, Diggersby assists Nihilego by threatening Chansey. Togekiss is a good partner that can ease Diggersby's Speed issues with Thunder Wave and paralyze foes such as Tentacruel and Jirachi. Heal Bell also allows Diggersby to be more aggressive against foes like Moltres. Additionally, Pokemon that threaten Togekiss, like Celesteela, can be worn down by Diggersby over time. Amoonguss and Tangrowth help check common revenge killers to Diggersby such as Zarude and Keldeo and also offer sleep support to allow Diggersby to enter play more easily.</p> "

This helps the team make significant progress by wearing down Pokemon like Amoonguss and Tangrowth, which stop Diggersby's momentum.

  "Aegislash": {
    "overview": "<p>Aegislash's unique typing with useful resistances and immunities coupled with its great blend of offense and defense make it one of the most influential Pokemon in the tier. It can run many different sets that allow it to pick and choose its counters. A Substitute + Toxic set is one of the hardest foes to switch around and take down, as it capitalizes on Aegislash's great bulk to whittle down its common checks with Toxic damage and powerful Shadow Balls. Swords Dance Aegislash with Shadow Sneak is an incredibly threatening sweeper that can pick off many teams just after some chip damage. Mixed sets make for strong wallbreakers that are capable of 2HKOing Chansey and heavily damaging Zarude, which would otherwise be safe switch-ins. It can also effectively run an Autotomize set with Weakness Policy, which takes advantage of the many weak super effective moves thrown at it, like Tentacruel's or Nihilego's Knock Off, while fixing one of its greatest flaws in its low Speed. Its great bulk in Shield forme and Stealth Rock resistance give it points of entry into Pokemon without strong super effective attacks like Nihilego and Jirachi. Still, Aegislash suffers from a very low Speed and typing that is vulnerable to many of UU's staples, including Krookodile, Moltres, and Zarude, which can easily revenge kill it. Aegislash is also overly reliant on King's Shield to tank most neutral hits, which can make it very predictable for setup sweepers like Dragon Dance Salamence and Swords Dance Lycanroc-D to take advantage of it. Lacking reliable recovery also leaves it very vulnerable to being worn down in the course of a game, especially if it takes Knock Off from Pokemon it wants to check like Nihilego. Some mixed walls like Assault Vest Tangrowth and Celesteela can easily scout and force out Aegislash early-game, which greatly hinders its unpredictability factor and lets opponents adjust accordingly.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Shadow Sneak is an option as the fourth move on the King's Shield + Toxic set to pick off weakened foes, most notably setup sweepers like Necrozma and Polteageist; however, it isn't as consistently useful as other options. Steel Beam gives Choice Specs Aegislash an incredibly powerful nuke to OHKO foes like Amoonguss, but it is not preferred due to Aegislash already effectively threatening Amoonguss with its other moves and the move whittling Aegislash down rather quickly. Choice Band makes Aegislash a terrifying physical wallbreaker and makes its priority even stronger, although this set can struggle with Rocky Helmet users like Amoonguss and doesn't appreciate being locked into moves. Metal Sound exploits defensive switch-ins like Amoonguss, giving Aegislash a great chance to KO it after Stealth Rock damage. However, this isn't the most consistent move, as it is very prediction reliant and unable to punish faster Pokemon on the switch; also, even with the -2 drop, sturdier Pokemon like Assault Vest Tangrowth can still deal with Aegislash.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Aegislash notably struggles with Dark-types like Obstagoon, Zarude, and Krookodile; while it does have Close Combat to punish them if they get too careless, they still threaten it with super effective moves and can easily switch in on Shadow Ball. Galarian Moltres and Umbreon are especially troublesome, as they have the special bulk to tank Aegislash's hits and can shake off status with Rest and Heal Bell, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Mixed Walls: Mixed walls like Assault Vest Tangrowth, Amoonguss, and Celesteela are very annoying for Aegislash early-game, as they aren't immediately threatened by any of its moves and can KO Aegislash in its Blade forme thanks to their lower Speed and super effective coverage. Chansey completely walls sets lacking Close Combat and can regain momentum with Teleport. However, it struggles more against Aegislash with Close Combat than the three previously mentioned.</p> <p><strong>Burn and Knock Off: Losing its passive recovery to Knock Off or a burn greatly limits the effectiveness of the King's Shield + Toxic set, making it incredibly susceptible to chip damage from weak attacks and Stealth Rock. Other sets also hate one or both of these, as special sets are very dependent on their boosting items and physical sets are significantly weaker when burned.</p> ",

Substitute allows Aegislash to get even more Toxic damage while also reducing the prediction it needs; it can also stop moves like Amonguss's Spore. King's Shield allows Aegislash to switch into its Shield forme and scout Choiced-locked foes like Krookodile and Keldeo so that it can switch into the right teammate if needed. Heavy investment in HP and Special Defense lets Aegislash switch into Pokemon like Salamence and Galarian Slowbro without fearing a 3HKO in Shield forme and cripple or attack them; this investment also stops Amoonguss's Foul Play from breaking its Substitute. 136 Speed EVs are an option to outpace Conkeldurr and everything slower.</p> <p>This set is a solid fit on semi-stall and balance teams thanks to its ability to heavily wear down Aegislash's typical checks, open up holes for its teammates, and be a solid defensive presence. Specially defensive foes that don't care about Toxic, like Celesteela and Chansey, are incredibly hard for this set to deal with, stopping it from making any progress; that's why powerful wallbreakers such as Mienshao pair really well with it, and Aegislash can soften up some checks to them like Salamence with Toxic damage. Other offensive Pokemon like Jungle Healing Zarude and Obstagoon don't care what Aegislash can do to them, so sturdier walls like Tangrowth and Kommo-o pair really well with this set. Fairy-types like Primarina and Togekiss give it more security against Fighting-types and cover Aegislash's Dark weakness; Sylveon is a notable partner, giving Aegislash Wish support so that it doesn't rely solely on Leftovers for its recovery. Umbreon is another useful partner, not only providing Wish but also easily spreading Toxic and checking some nuisances for Aegislash like Moltres and Nidoking. Regenerator and a Poison typing make Amoonguss one of the most obnoxious foes against this set, meaning that offensive checks to it like Moltres and Mamoswine are natural partners. Aegislash teams need a secondary check for Tangrowth and Nihilego, as they commonly run Knock Off and can leave Aegislash horribly crippled; Pokemon like Amoonguss can achieve this exact job.</p> "

    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Super Fang can be used to weaken bulky walls like Chansey and Celesteela and make it easier for its teammates to revenge kill them while also pairing nicely with Taunt, but it's not very useful otherwise. Boomburst is another option for an attacking move, having an incredibly high Base Power without the drawbacks of Draco Meteor or Hurricane, but it is weaker and does not hit anything super effectively. Defog is a solid option, as Noivern is the fastest Defogger in the metagame and also checks common entry hazard setters like Jirachi and Kommo-o. However, Noivern struggles to fit Defog into its moveset, and if you want to run a Dragon / Flying Defogger, Salamence is a better option. Choice Specs is an option to make Noivern hit harder, but the lack of Heavy-Duty Boots makes Noivern incredibly susceptible to Stealth Rock, and thus it remains a very fringe option.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Special Walls: Chansey brushes off all of Noivern's moves and forces it to switch out, though it does have to worry about Taunt. Rhyperior can also easily sponge Noivern's attacks except for Draco Meteor. Finally, Celesteela is only 4HKOed by Noivern's Flamethrower, allowing it to serve as an occasional check.</p> <p><strong>Priority Users: Pokémon like Mamoswine and Lycanroc-D can use their super effective priority moves to bypass Noivern's blistering Speed and easily take it out.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off Users: Krookodile, Tangrowth, Conkeldurr, and other common Knock Off users can remove Noivern's Heavy-Duty Boots, which severely hampers its longevity and makes it unable to perform its role as a pivot as well as it could.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Hatterene, Primarina, and Azumarill can take at least one hit and hit Noivern hard with their super effective STAB moves.

Flamethrower prevents Noivern from being completely walled by Steel-types, such as Aegislash, Jirachi, and Celesteela. U-turn is an option over either STAB move that allows Noivern to pivot out of would-be checks and bring in teammates more safely. Noivern does prefer to run both STAB moves, however.

Rotom-W can check Mamoswine and deals with Ground-types like Krookodile and Rhyperior better than Noivern can. Grass-types, such as Tangrowth and Amoonguss, are able to come in on Pokemon like Thundurus-T and Lycanroc-D that threaten Noivern. Wallbreakers such as Lycanroc-D, Mamoswine, and Crawdaunt help make up for Noivern's lackluster offensive presence.

    "overview": "<p>Zygarde-10% is a unique wallbreaker and late-game cleaner in UU due to its exceptional Speed tier allowing it to outspeed Pokemon like Keldeo, Thundurus-T, and Lycanroc-D and giving it a great matchup against fast-paced teams. Thousand Arrows sets it apart from other Ground-types, as it can OHKO Pokemon that other Ground-types like Mamoswine struggle to break through like Rotom-W and Rotom-H. Thousand Arrows is also spammable in Grassy Terrain and against Flying-types, and the only UU Pokemon that resist it are Tapu Bulu, Buzzwole, and Tangrowth. Zygarde-10% is one of the only viable Extreme Speed users, allowing it to revenge kill weakened setup sweepers such as Gyarados. Zygarde-10% unfortunately has paper-thin defenses, meaning it cannot switch into virtually anything without taking big damage or being OHKOed. It even takes substantial damage from resisted attacks like Nihilego's Meteor Beam. Zygarde-10% also needs chip damage to OHKO many common threats like Primarina, and failing to OHKO them causes it to get slammed back. While Thousand Arrows provides great overall coverage, Zygarde-10% lacks reliable moves to overcome Grass-types like Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu, which can regain lost HP via Regenerator or Grassy Terrain, although Tapu Bulu must be wary of the possible Iron Tail.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Skitter Smack can be run to potentially OHKO Zarude as it pivots in on Thousand Arrows. Dragon Dance can be used with Life Orb to allow Zygarde-10% to sweep. However, Zygarde-10% will rarely get an opportunity to set up and will still struggle against Tangrowth and Tapu Bulu. Gyarados typically outclasses this set, as it is bulkier, deals more damage, has better coverage, and can snowball with Moxie. Zygarde-10% is fast enough to run a Coil set to bolster its offensive presence and allow it to hit just as hard as Choice Band, but without locking it into one move. This will also raise its Defense to allow it to withstand an extra hit and increase its accuracy to more reliably use moves like Iron Tail. Zygarde-10% will only realistically get an opportunity to set up against something it forces out, and it will still struggle against Tangrowth even after multiple boosts.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Tangrowth totally walls Zygarde-10%, which can only use Toxic against it. Tapu Bulu has to be wary of Iron Tail but takes minimal damage from Thousand Arrows, is immune to Outrage, and can OHKO Zygarde-10%. Amoonguss is immune to Toxic and takes little damage from Thousand Arrows, forcing Zygarde-10% to lock itself into Outrage to 2HKO it, which leaves Zygarde-10% open to Spore or a switch to any Dragon-resistant Pokemon.</p> <p><strong>Fairy-types: Fairy-type Pokemon like Azumarill, Primarina, and Hatterene can freely switch in while Zygarde-10% is locked into a Dragon-type move and KO it. Additionally, while they do not handle Thousand Arrows well, they will not be KOed by it, and Primarina and Hatterene can recover lost HP with Draining Kiss.</p> <p><strong>Faster Pokemon and Priority Users: Noivern can OHKO Zygarde-10% with Draco Meteor, though it doesn't switch into Thousand Arrows well. Choice Scarf users like Zarude and Krookodile can do major damage or OHKO Zygarde-10% with their strong STAB attacks. Mamoswine can OHKO Zygarde-10% with Ice Shard, and other priority users like Conkeldurr and Crawdaunt significantly reduce Zygarde-10%'s ability to stay in play.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Defensive Pokemon like Chansey and Quagsire can shrug off Thousand Arrows and inflict Toxic back. Zygarde-10%'s only chance of breaking through them is to hit them with two Outrage attacks, which leaves Zygarde-10% vulnerable to a Fairy-type switch-in. Buzzwole is also problematic for Zygarde-10% with defensive sets being able to shrug off any attack.</p> ",

Outrage will OHKO major threats like Salamence and Kommo-o. Toxic can be used to punish Zygarde-10%'s most reliable switch-ins, such as bulky Grass-type Pokemon like Tapu Bulu and Tangrowth, as well as physicially defensive Pokemon like Buzzwole. Iron Tail is also an option to OHKO Tapu Bulu after minimal chip damage as well as 2HKO Hatterene. Toxic is generally more reliable, as it is more accurate and can be used against more foes. Jolly is the required nature, as Adamant will render Zygarde-10% slower than many major threats like Keldeo and Lycanroc-D.</p> <p>Zygarde-10% fits best on offensive or balanced teams. Since Zygarde-10% is too frail to ever reliably switch in, it can only realistically be used as an initial wallbreaker, revenge killer, or late-game cleaner. Slow, bulky pivots like Chansey and Milotic can help get Zygarde-10% in safely to revenge kill Pokemon like Lycanroc-D and Rotom-W attempting to switch in.Tangrowth, Buzzwole, and Tapu Bulu give Zygarde-10% the most problems, so it will need a teammate that can comfortably switch into them like Amoonguss. Chandelure and Moltres can help remove these Pokemon, with the latter bringing Zygarde-10% in against the Rotom formes with U-turn. Nihilego is also an option to handle Grass-types, and it can set up Stealth Rock as well. Entry hazard setters like the aformentioned Nihilego and Krookodile can help wear down the enemy team to enable a Thousand Arrows or Outrage sweep. Rotom-H can help check Mamoswine, one of Zygarde-10%'s biggest threats, pressure the likes of Tangrowth and Buzzwole, and use Volt Switch to bring in Zygarde-10% safely. Since Zygarde-10% pressures Nidoking, Rotom-W, and Rotom-H significantly, Pokemon that struggle with them like Celesteela and Azumarill are good teammates.</p> "

Diancie doesn't fit as easily onto multiple team compositions as Krookodile and Rhyperior, but it offers unique role compression that makes it the perfect fit for certain teams. Because of its Rock typing, Diancie has a variety of weaknesses that limit the Pokemon it can effectively wall, and its lackluster Speed means it gets heavily damaged by slower wallbreakers like Primarina and Diggersby.

Moonblast, on the other hand, is powerful from the start and lets Primarina not rely too much on Calm Mind boosts to threaten Water-resistant Pokemon like Tangrowth and Rotom-W. Scald is a reliable Water-type move, capable of burning Pokemon trying to check it, like Tentacruel, Assault Vest Tangrowth, and Amoonguss. Leftovers compensates the 25% loss in HP from Substitute. With the given EV spread Primarina is able to beat Amoonguss one-on-one, as it ensures Amoonguss can't break Primarina's Substitute after a Calm Mind.</p> <p>Substitute + Calm Mind Primarina fits best on bulky offense and balance teams, as its ability to come in on moves like Draco Meteor from Salamence is greatly appreciated by other teammates. By switching on these moves, Primarina can either get a Substitute up or set up with Calm Mind if its checks have been eliminated or weakened. Strong wallbreakers like Mamoswine, Nidoking, and Aegislash can get past bulky Grass-types such as Amoonguss and Assault Vest Tangrowth. Electric-types such as Raikou and Thundurus-T force Primarina out of the field if it doesn't have a Substitute up, so Pokemon like Rhyperior and Seismitoad take care of them. They can also set Stealth Rock to aid Primarina in its sweep. Amoonguss and Tangrowth can take on strong physical attackers such as Diggersby and Mamoswine for Primarina. Chansey is extremely annoying, as it can take boosted hits with ease and threaten Primarina back with Toxic and Seismic Toss. Conkeldurr, Lycanroc-D, and Swords Dance Diggersby are powerful wallbreakers that can muscle through Chansey and remove it for Primarina.</p> "

It's also immune to secondary effects thanks to Shield Dust; this makes it impossible for Pokemon like Choice Scarf Jirachi to antilead it, and its access to Skill Swap means that not even Hatterene can prevent it from getting its entry hazard up. As a result, Ribombee is a cornerstone on Sticky Web teams as the best available setter. It can struggle with certain hazard removers that resist Moonblast, though; examples include Excadrill, Moltres, and Tentacruel.

It also cripples setup sweepers like Gyarados and Galarian Slowbro that try to take advantage of Ribombee while also paralyzing wallbreakers like Nihilego and Nidoking. U-turn can work well with Stun Spore to pivot out against threats who switch into Stun Spore like Excadrill, allowing Ribombee to bring in a teammate to pave the way for it to safely set up Sticky Web again. Skill Swap is primarily used to bypass Hatterene's Magic Bounce, but it can have bonus effects like removing Beast Boost from Nihilego or Sheer Force from Nidoking, opening up Ribombee's teammates a bit.

Access to strong coverage moves, such as Close Combat to break past Excadrill, Crunch to deal with Aegislash, and Psychic Fangs to break past Amoonguss makes Lycanroc-D very unpredictable to defensively answer. However, Lycanroc-D struggles to break through teams that run physically bulky threats such as Tangrowth, Swampert, and Skarmory. Its poor bulk also means it cannot come in on almost anything, so it requires pivot support to come in safely as well as occasional aggressive prediction on expected switches. Lycanroc-D is also very prone to wearing itself down with Life Orb recoil, limiting its staying presence on the field.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Swords Dance is an option that allows Lycanroc-D to OHKO foes like Amoonguss and Tangrowth at +2; however, it can struggle to find many opportunities to set up safely. Drill Run is nice to give Lycanroc-D excellent Rock- and Ground-type neutral coverage, but the only notable Pokemon it hits super effectively is Colbur Berry Galarian Slowbro. A Focus Sash lead Lycanroc-D is able to use Endeavor while setting up Stealth Rock, but this is generally not worth it in comparison to its other, much more dynamic sets.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Grass-types: Amoonguss and Tapu Bulu do not switch into Stone Edge well, but they resist Close Combat and threaten Lycanroc-D after switching in; the former also runs Rocky Helmet often, which punishes Lycanroc-D. Tangrowth is the biggest offender, since unboosted Close Combat damage is restored nearly completely by Regenerator, it commonly uses Rocky Helmet, and it can freely threaten Lycanroc-D's team in multiple ways after it comes in. Choice Scarf Zarude takes Accelrock well and can OHKO it with Power Whip.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Skarmory's excellent physical bulk and reliable recovery lets it effortlessly wall Lycanroc-D unless significantly chipped. It also can wear Lycanroc-D down with Rocky Helmet. Choice Scarf Jirachi resists Lycanroc-D's Accelrock and can revenge kill it with Iron Head, only having to fear the rare Sucker Punch. Unless carrying the necessary coverage, Aegislash can safely pivot into Lycanroc-D multiple times and threaten to OHKO with either of its STAB moves. Aegislash can also remove Lycanroc-D if weakened into Shadow Sneak Range.</p> <p><strong>Water-types: Foes like Slowking, Primarina, and Swampert that don't fall to one hit and are capable of firing back with super effective attacks pose problems for Lycanroc-D, which has to be kept in reserve while its teammates wear them down. Starmie naturally outspeeds and can threaten Lycanroc-D, though it must be wary of its health to avoid being taken out by Accelrock. Azumarill and Crawdaunt can take an Accelrock from Lycanroc-D unless they are severely weakened and revenge kill it with Aqua Jet in return.</p> <p><strong>Revenge Killers: Choice Scarf users that are not in range of its priority are able to revenge kill Lycanroc-D due to its frailty; Mienshao, Diggersby, and Krookodile are all notable for their resistance to Accelerock and ability to OHKO Lycanroc-D with their STAB moves.

Alternatively, Psychic Fangs is an option that inflicts heavy damage on the likes of Amoonguss, Tentacruel, and Keldeo. However, most of the targets Psychic Fangs hits can be muscled through with Stone Edge after they have taken decent chip damage. Close Combat is a powerful coverage option that nails many Rock resistant Pokemon such as Keldeo, Krookodile, and Excadrill. Crunch hits Aegislash, Jirachi, and Galarian Slowbro harder. Accelerock is useful against offense teams, specifically keeping threats such Agility-boosted Galarian Moltres and Dragon Dance Salamence in check. It also makes Lycanroc-D more difficult to revenge kill with faster threats such as Venusaur in sun and Starmie. Sucker Punch can be used to deal more damage than Accelerock against neutral targets; however, it is only really useful for a better matchup against Choice Scarf Jirachi. A Life Orb is used to guarantee feats such as 2HKOing defensive Celesteela with Close Combat and Amoonguss with Stone Edge on the switch with Stealth Rock up. Maximum Speed investment with a Jolly nature is needed to make Lycanroc-D outspeed and threaten as many foes as it can, particularly Keldeo.</p> <p>Lycanroc-D fits best on offensive teams that appreciate its ability to revenge kill common offensive threats such as Salamence without sacrificing its teammates' wallbreaking capabilities. As Lycanroc-D is unable to switch in on mostly anything, pivots are appreciated to give it opportunities to punch holes as often as possible and gain momentum; Moltres and Rotom-H are efficient at this and help pressure Skarmory and bulky Grass-types, which usually give Lycanroc-D grief. Swampert also acts as a pivot while providing entry hazard support to wear down Slowking, Tapu Bulu, and Tangrowth. Krookodile is another Stealth Rock setter that draws out Skarmory and Amoonguss to remove their Rocky Helmets with Knock Off. Special attackers such as Moltres and Primarina appreciate Lycanroc-D's ability to break through Chansey, and in return they can help wear down common physically defensive threats such as Skarmory for it. The Grass-types of the tier like Tangrowth and Zarude are excellent partners to handle threats such as Azumarill. Additionally, they also check faster Pokemon Lycanroc-D cannot threaten as much with its priority, such as Zygarde-10%.

Furthermore, its decent defensive typing, speed, and ability in Grassy Terrain allows it to distinguish itself from other bulky Grass-types like Amoonguss and Tangrowth by being a more reliable check to Keldeo and Azumarill as well as enable threats like SubToxic Aegislash, though it does have to be wary of the former crippling it with a Scald burn and hitting it with Choice Specs-boosted Air Slash or Icy Wind. While Tapu Bulu's typing has many useful resistances, it comes at the cost of having a lot of weaknesses to common attacking types like Fire, Ice, and Poison, meaning it struggles against staples like Entei, Mamoswine, Nidoking, and even Kommo-o due to its tendency to run Poison Jab. The tier has an abundance of defensive checks to Tapu Bulu, such as Salamence, Amoonguss, and Aegislash, which makes it difficult for Tapu Bulu to make much progress as a wallbreaker, especially when multiple of these checks are naturally found on the same team. Despite its positive traits compared to Amoonguss and Tangrowth, they still outclass it as a defensive Grass-type due to their access to Regenerator and less vulnerable typing.

Thanks to its decent offensive stats, powerful STAB Heavy Slam, and access to Flamethrower to smack foes like Aegislash and Zarude, Celesteela can prevent itself from being too passive. Leech Seed is also an excellent tool, sustaining Celesteela's longevity and allowing it to significantly wear down its switch-ins, such as Rotom-H and Thundurus-T, potentially forcing them out. Autotomize sets are also a strong option, tapping into Celesteela's strong special coverage and the sweeping potential Beast Boost lends it. Despite its defensive potency, however, Celesteela suffers a bit from its lack of access to reliable recovery, which can prevent it from tanking strong neutral hits as consistently as it would like to and cause it to be overreliant on Leftovers. This can allow a few common Pokemon, such as Nihilego and Mamoswine, to muscle past Celesteela after relatively minimal chip damage. Celesteela also struggles to bypass popular Fire- and Electric-types such as Moltres and Thundurus-T on its own, as well as various defensive picks like Tentacruel and Slowking; Tentacruel can utilize Liquid Ooze to take advantage of Leech Seed, while Slowking doesn't take meaningful damage from any of Celesteela's attacks, can absorb Leech Seed and Teleport out, and can threaten to chip Celesteela down with burns from Scald.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Celesteela's can utilize a mixed Assault Vest set to better answer Aegislash and Salamence, with its colorful movepool letting it surprise typical checks such as Slowking with Megahorn and Moltres with Stone Edge and potentially break large holes in the opposing team. Due to its selection of potent physical moves such as Earthquake and Stone Edge, Celesteela can also run a physically based Autotomize set, effectively luring checks like Tentacruel and Rotom-H. However, this generally isn't as effective due to Celesteela's middling immediate power and hardships breaking various Pokemon, such as Tangrowth and Krookodile. Earthquake is an option in the fourth slot of the defensive set to still hit Steel-types super effectively while also hitting Tentacruel hard. However, Flamethrower is usually way more valuable for its ability to pressure Zarude while still hitting Steel-types. Toxic cripples some of Celesteela's switch-ins on the defensive set, but it generally isn't as useful as its other options, and, due to foregoing either Protect, it notably makes Celesteela more susceptible to being worn down.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fire-types: Fire-types like Moltres, Volcanion, Rotom-H, and Chandelure can pivot in on both Heavy Slam and Flamethrower and hit Celesteela hard with super effective STAB moves. They can also blanket check Celesteela's Autotomize set if it opts for Flash Cannon, though Meteor Beam can power through them. Moltres is particularly annoying, often being able to restore any chip damage it sustains from Leech Seed with Roost.</p> <p><strong>Electric-types: Electric-types like Thundurus-T, Rotom-W, and Toxtricity can tank hits from either of Celesteela's sets and proceed to break past it with super effective STAB attacks, though they all take fair damage from Meteor Beam.</p> <p><strong>Specially Defensive Pokemon: Chansey doesn't take major damage from Celesteela's attacks and can whittle it down with Seismic Toss or bring in a teammate with Teleport. Tentacruel's Liquid Ooze punishes Leech Seed attempts and it doesn't take major damage from any attack Celesteela commonly runs. Slowking can pivot into Celesteela and Teleport out to stop Leech Seed or chip it with Scald.</p> <p><strong>Knock Off: Celesteela's defensive set becomes far easier to wear down if Leftovers, its most reliable means of passive recovery, has been removed. Knock Off users like Mamoswine, Azelf, and Nihilego can wear it down immensely as it tries potentially pivoting in on them. The Autotomize set is also often reliant on whichever item it is running to pose a significant offensive threat, which can prevent Celesteela from setting up on foes like Nihilego and Tangrowth as safely as it would like to at times.</p> <p><strong>Strong Wallbreakers: Celesteela's lack of reliable recovery allows particularly powerful wallbreakers, including Conkeldurr, Primarina, Mamoswine, and Aegislash, to quickly overwhelm it.</p> ",

Leech Seed is important to wear down common switch-ins, including Moltres, Rotom-W, and Thundurus-T. It also prevents Pokemon like Gyarados and Dragon Dance Salamence from reliably setting up on Celesteela, chipping them down. Protect works well alongside Leech Seed, offering Celesteela a guaranteed opportunity to restore health with both Leftovers and Leech Seed. It can also help to scout moves from Choice-locked Pokemon, like Zygarde-10% and Primarina.</p> <p>Celesteela is a solid fit on bulky offense and balance teams thanks to its ability to check several prominent threats like Galarian Moltres and Zarude, allowing offensive teammates to fall back on it upon losing momentum to foes like Salamence. Bulky Water-types often share strong synergy with Celesteela, checking the Fire-types that power through it, while Celesteela can handle Pokemon like Zarude and Tapu Bulu in return. Swampert and Slowking check both Rotom-H and Moltres, two of Celesteela's more effective answers, while also being helpful against Mamoswine. Slowking can also bring Celesteela in safely with Teleport against foes such as Tapu Bulu and Hydreigon. Nihilego is another good teammate, pivoting in on Pokemon like Moltres and Thundurus-T for Celesteela while appreciating its ability to deal with Ground-types such as Excadrill and Nidoking. Defensive Grass-types like Tangrowth and Amoonguss can also make solid teammates, as they can pivot into threats to Celesteela like Keldeo and Azumarill. They both can absorb Knock Off for Celesteela, and the former can use Knock Off itself to cripple switch-ins to Celesteela like Moltres. Zarude is another phenomonal partner capable of offensively pressuring Slowking better and revenge killing Thundurus-T. Entry hazard removal from the likes of Tentacruel keep Celesteela from being worn down by Stealth Rock.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Autotomize allows Celesteela to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame and more easily snowball. It can find setup opportunities against a solid amount of common Pokemon that its defensive set forces out, including Zarude, Hatterene, and Nihilego. Fire Blast provides important coverage against Steel-types like Aegislash and Jirachi. Flamethrower is an option over Fire Blast for its greater accuracy. However, Celesteela wants all the power it can get due to this set's nature as a sweeper. Meteor Beam grants Celesteela an opportunity to bypass Fire-types like Rotom-H, Moltres, and Chandelure. It also deals massive damage to foes like Rotom-W, Thundurus-T, and Salamence, and the Special Attack boost it supplies is often extremely useful in boosting Celesteela's sweeping capabilities. Due to taking two turns, however, it must be used with Power Herb, and Celesteela must watch out for the opponent predicting the attack and bringing in a foe that resists it due to often being restricted to a one-time use. Flash Cannon is also an option in the fourth slot, offering more overall consistency and giving Celesteela a strong secondary STAB attack that deals decent neutral damage and hits Pokemon like Hatterene, Nihilego, and Rhyperior super effectively. Giga Drain is an option to bypass Quagsire, Swampert, and Rotom-W, which can otherwise tank various hits, though it generally doesn't provide too valuable of coverage otherwise. Beast Boost lets Celesteela boost its Special Attack upon netting KOs, giving it great sweeping potential. If Meteor Beam is not being run, Celesteela has no need for Power Herb and can then run Weakness Policy. This allows it to use its solid bulk to tank super effective hits, such as Fire-type moves from Salamence or opposing Celesteela, to gain a +2 boost in power, which heavily increases its threat level.</p> <p>This set fits on offensive builds, acting as a late-game sweeper that cleans weakened teams. On hyper offense teams, leads like Excadrill and Scolipede can provide entry hazards to wear down checks like Rotom-W and Slowking. Powerful wallbreakers like Azumarill and Aegislash make strong teammates capable of removing foes such as Slowking and Chansey for Celesteela to sweep through late-game. Depending on the coverage it opts for, Celesteela will struggle to reliably break past various Pokemon. If it isn't running Meteor Beam, checks to Fire-types like the aformentioned Azumarill and Gyarados are great teammates, easily being able to pressure Rotom-H and Moltres. Without Flash Cannon, Celesteela can't hit Rock-types like Rhyperior and Nihilego super effectively, making Pokemon like Zygarde-10% and Mamoswine solid partners. Lastly, secondary sweepers like Thundurus-T and Nihilego often fit well with offensive Celesteela, helping pressure and overwhelm the likes of Chansey and Slowking.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Necrozma is a solid sweeper in UU thanks to its offensive versatility, allowing it to bypass traditional answers like Chansey and Celesteela with its unpredictability. Its Dragon Dance set is a strong sweeper, powering through metagame staples like Slowking and Amoonguss. On the other hand, its Meteor Beam set is equally as potent, allowing it to lure in and slam answers to the Dragon Dance set like Celesteela and Mandibuzz. Necrozma's high natural bulk and Prism Armor allow it to set up on many Pokemon like Nihilego and take super effective hits from threats like Lycanroc-D and even Aegislash. Necrozma also has a solid matchup against common entry hazard removers like Salamence and Tentacruel, letting it act as an offensive Stealth Rock setter capable of supporting its team. However, Necrozma heavily dislikes status from threats like Chansey and Aegislash, which limits its chance to sweep. Necrozma is also limited by the number of Dark-types in the tier like Zarude, Mandibuzz, Hydreigon, and Galarian Moltres, which can all hinder at least one of its sets. Overreliance on Power Herb on Necrozma's Meteor Beam set makes it hard to pull off a sweep at times with Pokemon like Hydreigon and Slowking being common, while the Dragon Dance set can be worn down it accumulates multiple boosts.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Necrozma can run a Calm Mind + Moonlight set thanks to its great bulk, allowing it to be a strong late-game sweeper. However, Necrozma is walled by Hydreigon, Mandibuzz, and Slowking who can all wear it down or pivot out into a strong revenge killer like Zarude. Necrozma can run Expanding Force over Photon Geyser on its Meteor Beam set on Psychic Terrain teams for more devastating damage, but the limited viability of the playstyle and reliance on Terrain being active make Photon Geyser the preferred option. A final option is a Stored Power set with Cosmic Power or Calm Mind to boost Necrozma's stats, but it lacks the dangerous immediate sweeping potential of Necrozma's other sets and can be inconsistent at times.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Dark-types: Choice Scarf Hydreigon and Zarude can easily revenge kill Necrozma, even at +1 Speed from Dragon Dance. However, if Necrozma uses Autotomize, it can threaten them before they attack. Still, Hydreigon forces Necrozma to conserve its Power Herb as it can take advantage of Meteor Beam requring two turns. Umbreon can tank hits from all sets and cripple it with Toxic. Although they must watch out for Meteor Beam, both Mandibuzz and Galarian Moltres can take on Necrozma.</p> <p><strong>Special Walls: Special walls like Chansey, Slowking, and Assault Vest Reuniclus can take on the Meteor Beam set with ease. However, they must watch out for the Dragon Dance set. Celesteela walls the Dragon Dance set and can take a boosted Heat Wave while wearing down Necrozma with Leech Seed, but it can get overwhelmed easily. Hatterene can take boosted attacks from Necrozma and lower its Special Attack with Mystical Fire.</p> <p><strong>Status: Status is detrimental to Necrozma's attempts to sweep, so moves like Thunder Wave from Togekiss, Scald from Slowking, and Toxic from Aegislash, Excadrill, and Chansey greatly hinder it.</p> ",

Alternatively, Earthquake can be used to reliably beat other Steel-types like Aegislash and Jirachi. Since Prism Armor lets Necrozma take weak super effective hits like Knock Off from Nihilego with ease, Necrozma can employ a Weakness Policy to get a huge boost to its Attack. Alternatively, with a Lum Berry, Necrozma can set up on Pokemon like Amoonguss, Rotom-W, and Slowking, which would normally stay in to cripple it with status.

Psychic Terrain support from Indeedee-F allows Necrozma to boost its damage output without fearing priority from Azumarill or Lycanroc-D if weakened.

Thanks to Punk Rock and Boomburst, Toxtricity is able to deal heavy damage to walls like Amoonguss, Tangrowth, and Rhyperior and maintain pressure on Pokemon that resist its STAB combination, such as Nidoking and Swampert. In addition, Toxtricity has a relatively decent defensive typing, allowing it to come in on Iron Head from Jirachi and Close Combat from Cobalion and threaten to 2HKO them. It can also pivot into various passive Pokemon such as Togekiss and Amoonguss. Despite Toxtricity's middling Speed, Shift Gear can allow it to outpace foes like Keldeo, Salamence, and even Choice Scarf Krookodile, making it a great late-game cleaner on offensive teams. However, Toxtricity's STAB attacks and Boomburst have immunities, making it a prediction-reliant wallbreaker that struggles to break through cores like Aegislash + Excadrill. Although Toxtricity's base 75 Speed is enough to outspeed the bulkier threats it is able to deal with, its bulk leaves it prey to revenge killers such as Thundurus-T, Excadrill, and Krookodile. Additionally, priority users such as Azumarill, Lycanroc-D, and Mamoswine can all halt a sweep by KOing a chipped Toxtricity.

While it does have some good matchups against some hazard setters, it also has poor ones, such as against Jirachi and Nidoqueen, so it can require prediction to make the most out of Magic Bounce. Excadrill is a hazard setter that not only forces out Hatterene but can completely ignore Magic Bounce thanks to Mold Breaker. Hatterene's dismal Speed tier greatly limits what it can accomplish against offensive teams.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>On Trick Room teams, Hatterene is an effective suicide lead with Focus Sash and Misty Explosion. Magic Bounce denies entry hazards from everything bar Excadrill, and using Misty Explosion right after Trick Room gives a safe entry point for teammates such as Crawdaunt with three turns of Trick Room still remaining. Hatterene can also be an offensive threat in Trick Room with Life Orb, but this sacrifices a lot of consistency in defensive utility because of its need for Special Attack investment and Life Orb recoil. Assault Vest alongside Nuzzle is an option to make Hatterene more bulky without a boost while still crippling the likes of Aegislash and Jirachi, but it faces stiff competition from Reuniclus, which has more consistent healing with Regenerator and better bulk to handle threats such as Keldeo.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Powerful Wallbreakers: Hatterene's poor Speed, lack of consistent recovery, and reliance on a Calm Mind boost to be a consistent threat makes it easy for Pokemon such as Mamoswine, Diggersby, and Crawdaunt to revenge kill it.</p> <p><strong>Steel-types: Jirachi takes little damage from Hatterene's STAB moves and threatens it back with Iron Head, though it dislikes Mystical Fire. Aegislash is an especially detrimental offensive threat, because even if it takes Mystical Fire on the switch a weakened Shadow Ball still threatens substantial damage; the Swords Dance set can take a Mystical Fire and obliterate Hatterene with a STAB move. Celesteela does not take too much damage from Mystical Fire due to its massive special bulk, and it 2HKOes with Heavy Slam.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Hatterene has plenty of opportunities to gain a Calm Mind boost against various Pokemon such as Mandibuzz and Hydreigon, though it does have to be wary of Flash Cannon from the latter. Calm Mind notably helps Hatterene stomach hits from strong attackers such as Choice Specs Keldeo better and retaliate with Draining Kiss. Draining Kiss is mandatory as a powerful recovery tool and is instrumental against Chansey; after three boosts, Draining Kiss + Leftovers will outheal Seismic Toss's damage. Psyshock is useful against opposing Calm Mind users, most notably Primarina, as well as a more immediate weapon against Chansey. Psychic is an alternative option because it OHKOes Amoonguss after one Calm Mind boost instead of two. It also helps Hatterene pressure Quagsire better with Special Defense drops. Mystical Fire is vital to deter Steel-types looking to come in on a Calm Mind or STAB move like Celesteela, Jirachi, and Aegislash. Leftovers augments the recovery from Draining Kiss and makes Hatterene harder for Pokemon such as Suicune to wear down. Hatterene needs 12 EVs in Speed to outrun Amoonguss and 56 EVs to outspeed Quagsire and help against stall, though Psychic is required for the latter Pokemon.</p> <p>Hatterene fits well on balance and bulky offense teams that appreciate its Magic Bounce relieving entry hazard pressure from Skarmory. Pokemon that handle hazard setters Hatterene cannot switch into well like Nidoqueen, Jirachi, and Nihilego are appreciated. Chansey and Celesteela are able to check them. Celesteela can also pivot into Excadrill. Hazard support from teammates such as Krookodile and Chansey wears down Hatterene checks such as Aegislash and Celesteela. Fire-types can blow through Steel-types that Hatterene has issues with; Rotom-H and Moltres are notably able to check Aegislash and take advantage of Celesteela. Amoonguss and Skarmory can act as secondary pivots into Mienshao and Conkeldurr as repeatedly taking hits from them and losing its Leftovers greatly diminishes its ability to clean with Calm Mind.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Obstagoon is the only Guts user with STAB Facade, allowing it to pressure physical walls such as Amoonguss with ease. Its solid bulk, decent Speed, and access to STAB Knock Off make it a unique offensive threat, being able to take out metagame staples like Rotom-W, Galarian Moltres, and most notably SubToxic Aegislash, who cannot touch Obstagoon due to its typing and status immunity. It also has an excellent matchup against slower bulkier teams because of its status immunity, ability to heal off chip damage with Rest, and high damage output with STAB Knock Off. Due to its poor defensive typing, Obstagoon is easily revenge killed by common threats like Thundurus-T and Lycanroc-D. The abundance of Fighting-types like Buzzwole, Keldeo, and Kommo-o is especially problematic for Obstagoon due to its 4x weakness to fighting moves. Also, it tends to have poorer matchups against hyper offense, as teams pack more faster threats that give Obstagoon few opportunities to wallbreak, although it still can potentially pick up a KO or two. Obstagoon hates Knock Off as it cannot activate Guts without its Flame Orb, severly limiting its threat level. Its overreliance on Sleep Talk isn't ideal, as it relies on RNG to click the correct move. Obstagoon is generally outclassed by other offensive Dark-types like Krookodile and Zarude due to their better defensive utility and less reliance on their item.</p> ",
    "comments": "<h1>Other Options</h1> <p>Bulk Up makes Obstagoon more difficult to revenge kill due to the increase in power and bulk, but its 4x weakness to Fighting still makes getting anywhere with setup difficult in the long term.

Parting Shot allows it to pivot on switch-ins such as Buzzwole.</p> <h1>Checks and Counters</h1> <p><strong>Fighting-types Moves: Fighting-types such as Keldeo and Mienshao can outspeed Obstagoon and KO it with ease with their STAB moves.

All of these Pokemon struggle to pivot into Obstagoon.</p> <p><strong>Physically Defensive Pokemon: Rhyperior, Buzzwole, and Diancie almost completely stonewall Obstagoon, though the former doesn't like Knock Off. Tangrowth can wear down Obstagoon with Rocky Helmet chip, forcing it to use Rest.</p> <p><strong>Residual Damage: Obstagoon puts itself on a timer as soon as it activates Flame Orb, so it can prematurely faint after a strong neutral hit.

Sleep Talk lets Obstagoon be a potent wallbreaker while asleep thanks to Guts remaining active. Close Combat OHKOs the only Pokemon in the tier that resist Obstagoon's STAB combination, Cobalion, while also letting it hit foes like Krookodile harder. Switcheroo can be used alongside Close Combat to cripple some slower physical attackers like Azumarill, Crawdaunt, and Tapu Bulu.

Rotom-H can bring Obstagoon in safely and pressure Amoonguss, physically defensive Tangrowth, and Celesteela. Noivern can revenge kill threats to Obstagoon like Keldeo and Cobalion. Obstagoon can also fit well on Sticky Web teams with Ribombee and Shuckle to patch up its Speed a bit. It also appreciates entry hazard support from Roserade, Nidoqueen, and Nihilego to get KOs on threats like Azumarill, Mamoswine, and Tangrowth.
