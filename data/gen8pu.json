However, it suffers extreme competition in this role from Pikachu, which boasts Extreme Speed and a greater offensive presence at the expense of some Speed. Fake Out lets Persian get extra damage on the foe without punishment and stall for extra poison damage, letting it follow up with Double-Edge in order to secure KOs on targets like the Silvally formes. Fake Out can also be used to pick off heavily weakened targets that have boosted their Speed, like Fraxure, in a pinch. Knock Off removes items from bulky switch-ins that otherwise disregard anything Persian can do to them, such as Mawile, Dusclops, and Hippopotas, and provides coverage for Ghost-types like Drakloak. U-turn lets Persian keep up momentum for its team, saving it from floundering against bulky foes like Stonjourner, Mawile, and Dusclops. Hypnosis can be used over Knock Off to better cripple switch-ins like Mawile but is unreliable due to its poor accuracy and leaves Persian unable to damage Ghost-types outside of U-turn. Silk Scarf is preferred in order to boost Persian's most important attacks without further cutting into its already limited longevity. Technician is vital in order to let Fake Out deal significant damage.</p> <p>Persian is a good fit for bulky offense teams utilizing Spikes, which help it gradually overwhelm its switch-ins with Spikes damage, Fake Out, and U-turn. Offensive Roselia is an effective Spiker that Persian can bring in on switchins such as Mareanie, Gourgeist, and Dubwool via U-turn to set up Spikes. Roselia can also utilize Sleep Powder to put shared checks like Mawile and Pawniard to sleep. Offensive entry hazard setters like Crustle and Pawniard help weaken foes early-game, and their hazards greatly aid Persian in its role as a revenge killer. Persian can form an effective VoltTurn core with teammates like Manectric, Raichu, and Raboot, all of which can cover Pokemon that can safely switch in on Persian such as Mawile, Stonjourner, and Pawniard. Silvally-Psychic can put offensive pressure on Fighting-types Persian struggles with, such as Throh, Falinks, and Hitmontop, while also threatening to set up and breaking down targets like Mawile to help Persian clean late-game. Mr. Rime can't switch in easily but can pressure Throh and Hitmontop, and its access to hazard control helps keep Persian from being overwhelmed by residual damage. Stacking other priority users like Pawniard and Falinks with Persian can form a powerful anti-setup core that takes pressure off Persian. Both examples also deter Defog with Defiant, making them good choices for teams utilizing Spikes.</p> "

Poliwrath's movepool is also solid, containing good offensive and defensive tools that let it function as either a powerful wallbreaker or a sturdy phazer. Beyond this, Poliwrath can potentially run other sets that make different use of its good traits, such as Choice Scarf, which mitigates its mediocre Speed tier. Despite being proficient in various areas, however, Poliwrath is not a master in any one of them. Poliwrath's meager offensive stats mean its damage output can be lackluster at times, which tends to make its defensive set even more passive. Poliwrath checks a lot of the tier, but common Pokemon like Espeon, Ribombee, and Charizard similarly threaten it. Finally, Poliwrath faces serious competition in its roles from more prevalent Pokemon. In terms of other wallbreakers, Basculin is faster and has access to priority and Flip Turn, while Jellicent can be harder to answer immediately due to Water Spout.

This allows teammates to run item removal, which makes it more flexible than Silvally-Ghost. Furthermore, the ability to choose its item, access to a secondary STAB to break past Normal-types more easily, and consistent super effective coverage for Scrafty gives Haunter a valuable niche over Trevenant.

It also doesn't help that not running Heavy-Duty Boots leaves Sneasel extremely vulnerable to all forms of entry hazards, while running it leaves Sneasel somewhat weaker and more vulnerable to status. Sneasel also faces competition from other fast revenge killers such as Archeops and Whimsicott, which have more switch-in opportunities and pivoting. Nevertheless, nothing in the tier can rival Sneasel's combination of typing, Speed, and powerful STAB combination.</p> ",

Sneasel rarely wants to directly switch into attacks, so it is best brought in as a revenge killer or through pivots such as Silvally-Fairy and Uxie. Silvally-Fairy is also able to remove hazards, while Uxie is able to set Stealth Rock up, and both can also check Fighting-types like Passimian, which can cause trouble for Sneasel. These Fighting-types, as well as defensive threats like Weezing and Silvally-Steel, should be taken out or greatly weakened for Sneasel before it starts setting up. Wallbreakers such as Charizard and Archeops are ideal for this role. Spikes setters and Rocky Helmet users such as Qwilfish and Druddigon are also ideal for dealing chip damage to Choice Scarf users such as Passimian and Togedemaru, ideally putting them into range of Sneasel's +2 Ice Shard before it starts setting up.</p> "

Because full control over the entry hazard game is difficult, Sneasel will either want very effective entry hazard removers or setters. Capable entry hazard removers such as Silvally-Fairy and Whimsicott give Sneasel more chances to wallbreak and are better for teams that can bring it in more frequently. Tsareena is an effective Rapid Spin user in some matchups and also a powerful wallbreaker in its own right, capable of wearing down many defensive Pokemon such as Weezing in conjuction with Sneasel. Entry hazard setters such as Ferroseed and Qwilfish make Sneasel more devastating each time it comes in but tend to also allow Stealth Rock on Sneasel's side of the field, limiting its switch-ins. Sweepers and cleaners such as Quiver Dance Ribombee and Dragon Dance Scrafty also make for good teammates, as they appreciate Sneasel's ability to deal heavy damage to opposing walls.</p> "

However, Magmortar is still outrun by many common threats such as Basculin and Silvally.

        "description": "<p>Choice Specs Glaceon is one of PU's scariest wallbreakers, capable of putting immense pressure on even some of the tier's best special walls in Throh and Type: Null as a result of its sheer power. Freeze-Dry allows Glaceon to threaten Ice-resistant Water-types like Pyukumuku and Corsola, and it's also Glaceon's best option against Lapras. Shadow Ball allows Glaceon to OHKO Galarian Mr. Mime and threaten specially defensive Mr. Rime. It also hits Klang and opposing Glaceon harder than any other move Glaceon can viably run. Water Pulse targets Carkol, though it doesn't have much use outside of that. Frost Breath can allow Glaceon to get past bulky Calm Mind and Cosmic Power users like Musharna and Gothitelle in a pinch, but the move is virtually useless outside of this one purpose and cuts into Glaceon's already limited coverage. A Timid nature can be used to outspeed Adamant Falinks and Choice Band Fraxure as well as Speed tie with offensive Roselia. Glaceon could opt to use Choice Scarf to act as a revenge killer rather than a wallbreaker. Although this allows Glaceon to take care of +1 Adamant Fraxure and circumvent typical offensive checks like Silvally-Grass and Raichu, such a set severely reduces Glaceon's power and faces serious competition from Mr. Rime and Galarian Mr. Mime due to their higher Speed tiers, better coverage, and access to Healing Wish. Glaceon's low Speed and poor defensive typing make it very easy to offensively pressure, so it appreciates having bulky teammates to fall back on in the face of faster Fire-, Fighting-, and Rock-types. Vibrava gives Glaceon an easier time switching in by removing entry hazards with Defog and generating momentum with U-turn. It's worth noting that a lot of Pokemon that Vibrava baits in and pivots out against, like Gloom and Togetic, find themselves easily exploited by Glaceon. Mareanie absorbs Toxic Spikes upon switching in, can wear teams down with its own Toxic Spikes, and also softens up bulky foes that depend on their item, like Type: Null and Lapras, with Knock Off. Although Glaceon is strong, it lacks the coverage to bypass dedicated Ice-type answers such as Munchlax and Klang. Wallbreakers like Mawile, Hitmontop, and Flame Orb Throh help to remedy this issue, and they appreciate Glaceon taking on physical walls like Mareanie, Shiinotic, and Gourgeist-XL. Mawile also provides Stealth Rock support to put further pressure on teams, while Hitmontop removes entry hazards with Rapid Spin. Glaceon has an easier time breaking through teams with Spikes support, essentially 2HKOing Type: Null after Stealth Rock and three layers of Spikes. Roselia is a great Spikes setter, capable of incapacitating foes like Klang with Sleep Powder and making them easier for Glaceon to overwhelm. Pivots like Manectric and Silvally-Bug can give Glaceon more opportunities to switch in, with both examples doubling as late-game sweepers that can exploit the holes that Glaceon leaves in teams earlier on. These pivots can annoy Pokemon like Lapras and Pawniard, while Glaceon can threaten Palpitoad and Carkol.</p> "

        "description": "<p>Because of its decent bulk and near-unique access to both Wish and Heal Bell, Glaceon can serve as a cleric for balance teams. Freeze-Dry is used instead of Ice Beam to hit foes like Lapras and Seaking harder. Heavy-Duty Boots prevents Glaceon from being worn down by entry hazards, which allows it to more easily switch around and better preserve the health of it and its teammates. This immunity to entry hazards, alongside Glaceon's higher Special Attack and natural defenses, helps to separate it from Togetic, another cleric that similarly has access to Wish and Heal Bell. Although Glaceon has higher Defense than Special Defense, its poor defensive typing is easily exploited by many of the tier's physical attackers, including Mawile, Falinks, and Silvally-Rock. There are fewer specially offensive Pokemon that can do the same, and opting for a specially defensive set provides defensive teams with a secondary check to threats like Ludicolo and opposing Glaceon. Stunfisk and physically defensive Mawile appreciate having their lack of reliable recovery mitigated by Wish support, and in return, they can absorb Knock Off and check threats that Glaceon is vulnerable to, such as Pawniard and Stonjourner. Pyukumuku can also absorb Knock Off as well as wall setup sweepers like Falinks and Crustle that threaten Glaceon thanks to Unaware. In return, Glaceon can relieve Pyukumuku of any potential status conditions, which is especially useful for Rest variants. Stronger special attackers like Beheeyem and Raichu are capable of overwhelming Glaceon, meaning that it should never be the only special wall on balance teams. Other specially bulky Pokemon such as Type: Null, Dusclops, Vibrava, and Munchlax make for great partners because of this, with Rest allowing all three examples to soak up status conditions for Glaceon as well. Glaceon allows these examples to rely less on Rest by providing them with Wish support. Checks to Fighting-types are useful partners, since they can often switch into Glaceon with ease. Mareanie is a notable example, since it can consistently check Fighting-types thanks to both Recover and Regenerator, further wears teams down through Scald and either Toxic or Toxic Spikes, takes pressure off of Glaceon's team by absorbing Toxic Spikes, and stops setup sweepers like Falinks in their tracks with Haze.</p> "

Stored Power utilizes the boosts from Calm Mind and Salac Berry and allows Swoobat to break through specially defensive walls such as Type: Null, Lickilicky, and Unaware Pyukumuku. Heat Wave serves as coverage for Steel- and Dark-types such as Klinklang, Mawile, and Pawniard. Alternatively, Roost provides Swoobat with recovery, letting it set up multiple Substitutes. Nasty Plot is a notable mention over Calm Mind, providing Swoobat with immediate wallbreaking power at the cost of not improving its special bulk, giving it worse matchups against threats like Shadow Ball Beheeyem and Calm Mind Drifblim. Thanks to Simple, Salac Berry provides Swoobat with a +2 boost to Speed, helping it outspeed offensive checks such as Choice Scarf Manectric and Golduck. As an alternative, Kee Berry boosts Swoobat's Defense, making it harder to revenge kill with priority moves like Pawniard's Sucker Punch and Falinks's First Impression.</p> <p>Swoobat is mainly found on offensive teams that can weaken its checks and enable it to set up and sweep. Pairing Swoobat with Fighting-types such as Throh, Falinks, and Hitmonchan is ideal, since they provide a check to Steel- and Dark-types like Klinklang and Pawniard, especially if Swoobat is not running Heat Wave. Furthermore, they can threaten specially defensive walls like Type: Null and Lickilicky, two foes that can pressure Swoobat with Shadow Claw and Knock Off, respectively. Swoobat is susceptible to priority Shadow Sneak from Gourgeist and Dusknoir, so answers to them like Unfezant and Morpeko make for good partners. Pivots such as Boltund, Golduck, and the aforementioned Morpeko can bring Swoobat safely into battle and provide it with more setup opportunities, with Morpeko also providing Parting Shot support. Memento support from Alolan Dugtrio is valuable, weakening a foe and letting Swoobat set up safely. Fellow special attackers like Lilligant and Glaceon can cripple and weaken shared checks like Klinklang and Type: Null, helping Swoobat clean late-game. Physically defensive walls like Stunfisk and Sandslash complement Swoobat by serving as checks to revenge killers like Choice Scarf Unfezant and Boltund while setting up entry hazards to wear down opposing foes; in return, they appreciate Swoobat setting up and threatening their checks like Appletun, Lilligant, and Golduck. The aforementioned Sandslash as well as Defog users such as Drifblim and Silvally-Rock can help remove Stealth Rock, keeping Swoobat healthy to enable more setup opportunities.</p> "

Roost is necessary to offset HP loss that activates Defeatist. Heavy-Duty Boots is another important tool that prevents Archeops's Stealth Rock weakness from wearing it down into Defeatist range. Archeops fits best on offensive teams, and it should primarily be brought in via safe switches in to wallbreak or revenge kill threats such as Galarian Articuno and Magmortar, as its lack of defensive utility prevents it from getting many free turns otherwise. For this reason, partners with pivoting moves like Ribombee and Whimsicott work well with Archeops, and they form a pivot core if Archeops is using U-turn. Lanturn is another partner that can bring Archeops in safely, and it can absorb both Water- and Electric-type attacks aimed at Archeops as well as provide an additional check to Togedemaru. Froslass can help pressure many of Archeops's checks, like Palossand and Rhydon thanks to its access to Spikes, notably bringing walls like Jellicent into 2HKO range of Stone Edge. Pokemon like Sneasel and Choice Specs Ribombee are problematic foes for Archeops, as they are faster and threaten to KO it, so Ferroseed and Choice Scarf Togedemaru can help pressure them.</p> "

Nasty Plot Mesprit and Swords Dance Silvally-Fairy are offensive threats that appreciate the support Archeops provides. Galarian Articuno can punish Defog attempts with Competitive, letting it become more dangerous even if Stealth Rock gets removed. Offensive checks to Sneasel such as Ribombee are helpful because it can prevent Stealth Rock from being set with Triple Axel, assuming it lands two hits.

This is because of them being more potent offensively, more reliably checking Throh, having reliable recovery, and generating momentum in Beheeyem's case. In spite of this, Gothitelle can still function as a solid bulky setup sweeper due to its decent bulk with investment, Cosmic Power further augmenting its defenses, and Stored Power allowing it to make excellent use of the boosts it accrues. Teams lacking Dark-types can struggle with Gothitelle, since even specially bulky Pokemon and Psychic-resistant Pokemon, such as Dusclops, Type: Null, and Silvally-Psychic, take too much damage after enough boosts. Stored Power also bypasses Pyukumuku's Unaware, meaning Gothitelle can be a major threat to stall teams. Leftovers lessens the need to use Rest and provides Gothitelle with passive recovery, while Colbur Berry reduces the damage that it takes from Dark-type coverage against foes like Grapploct. Competitive exploits moves and abilities that drop Gothitelle's stats, like Defog and Intimidate, by boosting its Special Attack and making Stored Power stronger. Moves like Mean Look and Thunderbolt can be used over Sleep Talk to trap and set up on passive foes or hit Dark-types, respectively, though forgoing Sleep Talk leaves Gothitelle completely helpless while it's asleep. Weakness Policy allows Gothitelle to take advantage of super effective coverage like Knock Off from Throh and U-turn from non-Swords Dance Silvally formes. This is an especially viable option, since most opponents will go for super effective moves against Gothitelle given its bulk.</p> <p>Gothitelle fits best on bulkier builds, since its defensive nature and relatively low Speed would cost more offensive teams too much momentum. Dark-types like Pawniard and Galarian Linoone completely wall Gothitelle if its only attacking move is Stored Power. Fighting-types like Hitmontop and Throh are important teammates to have because of this, with the former also removing entry hazards with Rapid Spin and the latter wearing teams down through the combination of Circle Throw and Knock Off. Strong attackers like Silvally-Bug, Choice Specs Glaceon, and Nasty Plot Raichu can overwhelm Gothitelle faster than it can boost, meaning that teammates to pressure these wallbreakers, like Lapras and Roselia, are appreciated. Roselia can also pressure opposing teams with Spikes and Toxic Spikes, making it easier for Gothitelle to sweep. Silvally formes like Silvally-Bug and Silvally-Electric can also be useful partners, providing support through blocking Trick and Switcheroo from Mr. Mime and Manectric, breaking through foes like Mawile, and potentially removing entry hazards with Defog. In return, Gothitelle can absorb status conditions and set up on potential revenge killers like Manectric locked into Overheat. Pairing Gothitelle with Dark-types, notably Taunt Pawniard, can prevent a potential stalemate against opposing bulky Stored Power users like Musharna and Duosion.</p> "

Jellicent also provides teams additional utility by punishing Water-types or Choice-locked attackers depending on if it's running Water Absorb or Cursed Body. However, Jellicent can be rather passive due to its low offensive capabilities and reliance on status as the typical way of dealing damage.

Hex is preferred as the sole attacking move on this set because it pairs well with its status moves versus bulkier defensive answers such as Lanturn. Colbur Berry is the optimal item in order to weaken Knock Off from the likes of Sneasel or Gallade, but Heavy-Duty Boots can be used in order to be immune to entry hazards. Jellicent can also opt to not use an item, allowing it to switch into Choice Band Froslass, at the cost of some defensive utility against other threats. Gigalith makes a fantastic partner for Jellicent, as not only is it a good check to special attackers like Haunter, but with Sand Stream and hazard support, the residual damage Jellicent can spread with Will-O-Wisp and Toxic can severely cripple offensive answers like Whimsicott and Vikavolt. Conversely, Gigalith appreciates Jellicent's ability to reliably provide a Fighting immunity versus Choice-locked attackers like Sawk. Silvally-Fairy is also a fine partner, since it acts as a Knock Off absorber if Jellicent isn't running Colbur Berry and handles Dark-types such as Absol. Whimsicott makes a great offensive partner for Jellicent thanks to its ability to offensively check Sandaconda, Scrafty, and Absol, whereas Jellicent can check Charizard decently well. 32 Speed EVs allow Jellicent to outspeed Carracosta and Taunt it, preventing it from setting up with Shell Smash.</p> "

Teammates holding a Choice item like Unfezant and Gourgeist also work, as they can switch into Pokemon with Trick and Switcheroo like Choice Scarf Mr. Mime and Manectric, while they can also revenge kill Pokemon that can overwhelm Type: Null, like Throh.

U-turn provides valuable utility and allows Silvally-Rock to pivot away from checks such as Sandslash and Throh. Alternatively, Flame Charge turns Silvally-Rock into a better late-game cleaner, boosting its Speed stat, letting it hit Klinklang, and enabling it to outspeed offensive checks such as Galarian Rapidash and Alolan Dugtrio and Choice Scarf users such as Drednaw and Golduck. Ice Beam serves as coverage for Ground-types such as Stunfisk and Sandslash. Psychic Fangs is a notable mention that allows Silvally-Rock to better break through Fighting-types like Throh and Falinks. Swords Dance Silvally-Rock is often found on offensive builds that appreciate its ability to fire off strong Multi-Attacks, keep offensive momentum with U-turn, and potentially clean late-game. If running Flame Charge over U-turn, Silvally-Rock should be preserved until late-game when its checks have been weakened or removed and it can set up and sweep. Partners such as Unfezant and Morpeko weaken physical walls such as Stunfisk and Sandslash, helping facilitate a late-game sweep. Pairing Silvally-Rock with special wallbreakers such as Appletun, Nasty Plot Gourgeist, and Mr. Rime can be beneficial, as they can take advantage of the aforementioned physical walls and defensive Throh; Eject Pack Appletun can also provide more setup opportunities by bringing Silvally-Rock in on special walls such as Type: Null and Lickilicky. Stunfisk and Sandslash also make for good partners, providing checks to Steel-types such as Klinklang and Mawile and setting up entry hazards. Checks to Fighting-types such as Galarian Rapidash, Mr. Rime, and Unfezant are also appreciated, with the former two also providing Healing Wish support.</p> "

Runerigus is completely walled by opposing Ghost-types like Froslass and Haunter with this set, so it benefits from Dark-types like Scrafty and Absol to pressure them. Weezing can spread burns to give Runerigus more setup opportunities and use Toxic Spikes to prevent Ghost-types like Palossand and Gourgeist from stalling it out. Fighting-types like Hitmontop and Gallade can check opposing Dark- and Ice-types like Absol and Arctovish and draw in bulky Pokemon like Quagsire and Sandaconda that Runerigus can use as setup fodder. Runerigus is also vulnerable to Pokemon such as Tsareena and Choice Specs Whimsicott that can break past it before it can boost high enough, so offensive checks to them like Charizard and Silvally-Steel are appreciated.</p> "

    "overview": "<p>Despite competition from Ribombee, with its superior typing and speed, as a Bug-type sweeper, Frosmoth makes for a niche yet threatening setup sweeper thanks to Quiver Dance and potent offensive coverage. Ice Scales also gives it many setup opportunities against special attackers such as Mesprit and Whimsicott, which differentiates it from Ribombee. Frosmoth's underwhelming Speed and physical bulk, mediocre defensive typing, and inability to hit Steel-types for significant damage render it easy to revenge kill and a liability in certain matchups.</p> ",

Giga Drain grants Frosmoth with recovery and targets Water-types like Jellicent, as well as dealing super effective damage to Rock-types like Regirock and Gigalith. Frosmoth greatly appreciates partners that can wear down the Steel-types it struggles to get past; Choice Specs Whimsicott and Mesprit make for great options, and they can both also cripple Pokemon like specially defensive Aggron and Togedemaru by using Switcheroo and Trick, respectively. Due to its lackluster Speed tier, Frosmoth finds itself easily revenge killed by threats like Choice Scarf Togedemaru; teammates like Silvally-Ghost and Coil Sandaconda can use the aforementioned threats that Frosmoth invites in as setup fodder. Charizard can wear down Pokemon like Gigalith with Toxic and can threaten Steel-types like defensive Togedemaru.</p> "

        "name": "Belly Drum",
        "description": "<p>Eiscue's unique Ability in Ice Face and access to Belly Drum make it a threatening, albeit matchup dependent, late-game sweeper. Reversal is an 80-Base Power attack after Eiscue uses Substitute and Belly Drum, providing great neutral coverage alongside Eiscue's Ice STAB and letting it take down Steel-type Pokemon it otherwise couldn't, such as Mawile, Pawniard, and Klang, as well as Lapras. Zen Headbutt sacrifices hitting those target in order to cover Mareanie, which otherwise walls Eiscue. Liquidation is a niche option that deals more damage to the aforementioned targets before Eiscue is set up. Substitute provides Eiscue with protection from status and revenge killing, and lets it activate its Salac Berry after using Belly Drum, outspeeding most of the unboosted metagame even if Ice Face hasn't been activated and outrunning even the fastest boosted Pokemon, like Choice Scarf Manectric and Quick Feet Galarian Linoone, if it has been activated. Belly Drum brings Eiscue's otherwise mediocre Attack stat to ridiculous levels, making it vital to sweeping. A Jolly nature with maximum Speed investment is used to let Eiscue outspeed fast Pokemon like Leafeon and Silvally at +1 if Ice Face isn't activated.</p> <p>Eiscue fits best on offensive teams that can break through its defensive answers. If Eiscue isn't running Zen Headbutt, teammates that can take on Mareanie are absolutely vital. Good examples of these teammates include Electric-type Pokemon like Manectric and Raichu and Psychic-type Pokemon like Mr. Mime, Musharna, and Mr. Rime, the latter of which can also remove entry hazards. Roselia can use Spikes or Toxic Spikes to help wear down the opponent's defensive backbone, check Water-types, put opposing Pokemon to sleep to provide Eiscue with more setup opportunities, and removes Toxic Spikes, which would otherwise shut Eiscue down. If Eiscue isn't running Reversal, teammates that can take on Steel-types are important. Falinks and Hitmontop are good at pressuring foes like Mawile, Klang, and Pawniard offensively, with Falinks fitting very well on hyper offense and Hitmontop offering hazard removal and reliable priority. The aforementioned Psychic-types are also great options for wearing down Steel-types, as most teams rely on those Pokemon to take them on, with Mr. Rime, Mr. Mime, and Musharna giving Eiscue a safe switch and a second chance at setting up via Healing Wish. Pivots such as the aforementioned Electric-type Pokemon, Silvally formes, and Drakloak can be useful for getting Eiscue on the field safely against Pokemon that it threatens, like Roselia, or that can't bypass Ice Face, as is the case for most physical attackers lacking Knock Off. Stonjourner makes for a strong lead option on offense that can provide Stealth Rock support and threaten several of Eiscue's answers with Earthquake. Other setup sweepers, like Fraxure, Pawniard, and the previously mentioned Falinks and Raichu, are effective at softening the opponent's defensive backbone for Eiscue. Wallbreakers like Swords Dance Mawile, Throh, and Choice Band Fraxure are effective teammates for the same purpose, with the former two being able to use Knock Off on sturdy answers to Eiscue, like Mareanie and Klang, that rely on their Eviolite to function effectively.</p> "
